C 
Capacity  Building
:  A  process  by  which  individuals,  instituti
ons  and  societies  develop  abilities,  
individually and collectively, to 
perform functions, solve problems 
and set and achieve their goals. 
Cartagena Declaration on Refugees
: A Declaration adopted by a coll
oquium of experts from the 
Americas in November 1984. The Declaration enla
rges the 1951 Convention definition of refugee 
to include “...persons who have fled their country b
ecause their lives, safety or freedom have been 
threatened  by  generalized  violence,  foreign  aggre
ssion,  internal  conflicts,  massive  violation  of  
human  rights  or  other  circumstances  which  have
  seriously  disturbed  public  order”.  While  the  
Cartagena Declaration is not a treaty, its provisi
ons are respected across Central America and have 
been incorporated in several national laws. 
Cessation Clauses
: Legal provisions that set out the conditions
 in which refugee status comes to an 
end  because  it  is  no  longer  needed  or  justified.  
Cessation  clauses  are  found  in  Article  1(C)  of  the  
1951 Convention, and in Article I (4
) of the 1969 OAU Refugee Convention. 
Citizen
:

 National. 
Closed Camp
: A camp, which is no longer receiving new refugees. 
Code  of  Conduct:*
  A  common  set  of  principles  or  sta
ndards  that  a  group  of  agencies  or  
organizations  have  agreed  to  abide  by  while  
providing   assistance   in  response  to  complex  
emergengencies  or  natural  disasters.For  example,  
the  Principles  of  Conduct  for  the  International  
Red   Cross   and   Red   Crescent   Movement   and   Non-
Governmental   Organisations   in   Disaster   
Response  Programmes,  and  the  IASC  Core  Principl
es  of  a  Code  of  Conduct  for  Protection  from  
Sexual Abuse and Exploitation. 
Co-Existence
:  A  situation  of  general  tolerance  betw
een  communities  afte
r  the  cessation  of  
hostilities  and  before  reconciliation.
  Initiatives  related  to  the  co-e
xistence  approach  include  peace  
education, sustainable community development, the socio-economic empowerment of refugees, the 
reintegration of child soldiers
 and partnership development. 
Combatant
:* A person who takes an active part in hostili
ties, who can kill, and who, in turn, is a 
lawful military target. S/he can be a member of 
the armed forces, other than medical personnel and 
chaplains, or of an organized gr
oup. Under international 
humanitarian law, arme
d forces are subject 
to  an  internal  disciplinary  system,  which,  inter  
alia,  must  enforce  compliance  with  the  rules  of  
international law applicable to armed conflict.  
Common Country Assessment (CCA)
: The common instrument of the United Nations to analyze 
the development situation in a certain country a
nd identify key national development issues in the 
context  of  both  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  
and  other  commitments,  goals  and  targets  of  
the  Millennium  Declaration,  international  conferences,  summits,  conventions  and  human  rights  
instruments. 
Community  Development
:  A  process  to  improve  the  economic,  
social  and  cultur
al  conditions  of  
communities.  Community  development  aims  to  integr
ate  refugees  into  their  host  countries  or  to  
reintegrate them upon return to th
eir country of origin, while improving the living standards of the 
whole community.

Complementary  Food
:  Food  items  provided  by  UNHCR  in  ad
dition  to  the  basic  food  ration  
provided by WFP. 
Complementary  Protection
:  Formal  permission,  under  national  la
w  or  practice,  to  reside  in  a  
country  extended  by  that  country  
to  persons  who  are  in  need  of
  international  protection  even  
though they do not qualify for 
1951 Convention refugee status. 
Complex  Emergency:*  
A  multifaceted  humanitarian  crisis  in  
a  country,  region  or  society  where  
there  is  a  total  or  considerable  
breakdown  of  authority  resulting  from  
internal  or  external  conflict  
and  which  requires  a  multi-sectoral,  internati
onal  response  that  goes  beyond  the  mandate  or  
capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing
 UN country programme. Such emergencies have, 
in  particular,  a  devastating  e
ffect  on  children  and  women,  and  
call  for  a  complex  range  of  
responses.  
Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP)
:  A  programming  process  through  which  national,  regional  
and international relief systems 
are able to mobilize and respond to
 selected major and/or complex 
emergencies that require a system-w
ide response to humanitarian crisis. 
Control Sheet
: Standard UNHCR registration form with only ve
ry basic date, used 
to list people to 
whom a Border Card or fixing token has b
een given, or issued a Passenger Manifest. 
Conventions
:  Formal  international  agreements  among  na
tions  (to  which  states  become  party),  
which  create  binding  legal  obligations.  Such  ag
reements  may  have  different  names:  treaty,  
convention,  covenant,  or  pact.  Conventions  ar
e  one  of  two  main  types  of  UN  human  rights  
instruments, the other being UN standards. 
Convention  Grounds
:  The  refugee  definition  in  the  1951  C
onvention  requires  that  the  fear  of  
persecution  be  linked  to  one  or  more  of  the  
following  five  grounds:  race
,  religion,  nationality,  
membership of a particular soci
al group, or political opinion. 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness
: A Convention that provides for the acquisition of 
nationality  by  those  who  would  otherwise  be  stat
eless  and  who  have  an  a
ppropriate  link  with  the  
State  through  birth  on  the  territo
ry  or  through  descent  from  a  
national.  The  Convention  also  
provides for the retention of nationality by those who would become stateless if they were to lose 
the  State’s  nationality.  The  Convention  was  a
dopted  in  August  1961  and  came  into  force  in  
December 1975. UNHCR has been mandated with specific functions under Article 11 of the 1961 
Convention on the Reducti
on of Statelessness. 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
: Adopted in 1989, this tr
eaty sets comprehensive 
standards for the protection of the rights of childr
en. It is underpinned by 
four  guiding  principles,  
one  of  which  is  non-discrimination  in  the  applicati
on  of  its  standards  to  a
ll  children.  Therefore,  
refugee children come fully within its scope. The 
other guiding principles ar
e the “best interest” of 
the child, the right to life, survival and development, and the right to participation.

Convention Plus
: An initiative launched by the High Commissioner during the fifty-third session 
of ExCom in October 2002 to improve refugee prot
ection worldwide and to facilitate the resolution 
of   refugee   problems   by   responsibility   and   bur
den   sharing   through   the   implementation   of   
multilateral  special  agreements  on  such  issues  as  secondary  movement,  resettlement,  and  the  link  
between assistance and development. 
Convention  Relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees
:  A  Convention  that  establishes  the  most  widely  
applicable framework for the protection of refu
gees. The Convention was adopted in July 1951 and 
entered  into  force  in  April  
1954.  Article  1  of  the  1951  Conventi
on  limits  its  scope  to  “events  
occurring before 1 January 1951”. This restriction is removed by th
e 1967 Protocol 
relating to the 
Status of Refugees. As of 1 July 2005, there ar
e 145 States who are parties to the 1951 Convention 
and/or the 1967 Protocol. 
Convention  Relating  to  the  Status  of  Stateless  Persons
:  A  Convention  that  provides  the  
definition  of  a  stateless  person  
and  establishes  a  framework  by  wh
ich  a  stateless  person  who  is  
lawfully resident in a State can have legal st
atus. The Convention was adopted in September 1954 
and entered into force in June 1960. 
Convention Refugee
: Persons recognized as refugees by States
 under the criteria 
in Article 1 A of 
the 1951 Convention, and entitled to 
the enjoyment of a variety of rights under that Convention. 
Country  of  First  Asylum
:  The  first  country  in  which  an  asylum-seeker  has  been  granted  an  
effective hearing of his/he
r application for asylum. 
Customary International Law
: International laws that derive their authority from the constant and 
consistent practice of States, rather
 than from formal expression in a 
treaty or legal text. In order for 
State practice to contribute to the formation of cu
stomary international law, that practice should be 
conducted with a sense of legal oblig
ation. Several of the provisions 
in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, including the prohibition against slav
ery, torture, prolonged arbitrary detention and 
extra-judicial  killings,  are  gene
rally  recognized  to  have  become  
part  of  customary  international  
law. 
D 
Decentralization
: The establishment of institutional and legal frameworks for decision making and 
the empowerment of sub-national institutions at the pr
ovincial, district, city, town and village levels 
in terms of fiscal, administrativ
e, political and legal processes.
Derivative Status
:
See 
Family Unity Principle. 
Detention
: Restriction on freedom of movement, usually through enforced confinement. Article 31 
of  the  1951  Convention  provides  certain  safeguards  
in  relation  to  the  rest
riction  of  freedom  of  
movement for refugees who enter or
 reside in the country illegally. 
Derogation
:  International  human  rights  law  allows  states  to  derogate  from  their  obligations  and  
restrict  the  enjoyment  of  human  rights,  but  
only  under  exceptional  circumstances  and  strict  
conditions, as follows: 
-
UNHCR, Status Determination and 
Protection Information Section

-
if there is a 
“public emergency which threat
ens the life of the nation”
. The threat must be to 
the existence of the state itself, not the governme
nt currently in power. This usually refers to 
an  armed  conflict  that  puts  th
e  whole  population,  territorial  in
tegrity  or  the  fundamental  
institutions of the state at risk, and 
where the threat is actual or imminent; 
-
the  normal  limitations  that  apply  to  the  en
joyment  of  rights  (e.g.,  public  order,  public  
health) must be shown to be insuffi
cient to deal with the situation; 
-
the derogation must be temporary; 
-
the  measure  must  be  “
officially  proclaimed
”,  i.e.,  the  legal  pro
cedure  set  out  in  the  
constitution or other law allowing fo
r the derogation must be followed; 
-
the  (extent  and  type  of  )  limitations  on  
the  enjoyment  of  human  rights  must  be  “
strictly 
required by the exigenci
es of the situation
”; 
-
the measures taken must not discriminate on th
e basis of race, color, sex, language, religion 
or social origin. 
Development Assistance for Refugees (DAR)
: A programming approach which aims to promote 
the  inclusion  of  refug
ees  and  host  communities  in  development  agendas  through  additional  
development  assistance  to  improve  burden-shar
ing  with  countries  hos
ting  a  large  number  of  
refugees  and  to  promote  a  bette
r  quality  of  life  and  self-relia
nce  for  refugees
  pending  durable  
solutions and an improved standard of
 living for refugee-hosting communities. 
Development  Through  Local  Integration  (DLI)
:  a  programming  approach  
applied  in  protracted  
refugee  situations  where  the  state  opts  to  provide  opportunities  for  the  gradual  integration  of  
refugees. It is based on the unders
tanding that those refugees who ar
e unable to repatriate and are 
willing  to  integrate  locally  will  find  a  solution  to  
their  plight  in  their  c
ountry  of  asylum.  DLI  is  
achieved through the inclusion of refugees in development plans. 
Durable  Solutions
:  Any  means  by  which  the  situation  of  
refugees  can  be  satisfactorily  and  
permanently resolved to enable 
them to live normal lives. UNHCR traditionally pursues the durable 
solutions of voluntary repatriation, lo
cal integration and resettlement.
Duties of Refugees
: The obligations refugees must meet in
 the country of asylum. Under Article 2 
of the 1951 Convention, refugees mu
st conform to the laws and regul
ations of any country in which 
they  find  themselves.  In  particular,  refugees  must
 refrain from any acts that jeopardize the safety, 
security or public order of communities or countries of asylum. 
E 
Emergency Relief
: The immediate survival assistance to the 
victims of crisis and violent conflict. 
Most relief operations are initiat
ed on short notice and have a shor
t implementation period (project 
objectives are generally completed within a year). 
The main purpose of emergency relief is to save 
lives. 
Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC):* 
The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs 
also  carries  the  title  of  Emergency  Relief  Coordi
nator.  In  this  role,  the  ERC  coordinates  the  
international response to humanita
rian emergencies and disasters. 
Empowerment
:  A  process/phenomenon  that  allows  peopl
e  to  take  greater  
control  over  the  
decisions, assets, policies, processes and 
institutions that affect their lives. 
Enclosed Camp:
 A refugee camp, which is physi
cally surrounded by a fence.

Enforcement   and   Implementation   (Control)   Mechanisms
:   the   system   for   monitoring   
implementation  and  enforcing  international  human  
rights  law  is  very  diffe
rent  from  how  states  
enforce their domestic laws. The former relies heavily
 on political pressure, a
nd it is the state, not 
individuals,  which  are  responsible  for  human  right
s  violations.  The  two  principle  ways  to  treat  
human rights violations within the UN system ar
e on the one hand the enforcement and complaint 
procedures established by each convention, and on 
the other by approaching some of the other UN 
agencies  and  offices  that  focus  on  human  rights.
  Complaint  mechanisms  exist  independent  from  
whether a country has ratified a human rights convention. 
Entry  into  Force
:  When  the  treaty  or  convention  becomes  a  functioning  and  enforceable  legal  
document.  A  convention  only  “enters  into  force”  af
ter  the  required  number  of  ratifications  (by  
states) have been received. 
Evaluation
:  A  systematic  and  objective  analysis  and  as
sessment  of  the  organization’s  policies,  
programmes,  practices,  partnerships  and  procedures,  focused  on  planning,  design,  implementation  
and impacts. 
Exclusion  Clauses
:  Legal  provisions  that  deny  the  benefits
  of  international  protection  to  persons  
who would otherwise satisfy the criteria for ref
ugee status. In the 1951 Convention, the exclusion 
clauses  are  found  in  Articles  1D,  1E  and  1F.  These  clauses  appl
y  to  the  following  categories:  
persons who are receiving protection or assistance
 from UN agencies other than UNHCR; persons 
who are recognized by the authorities of the country as having the rights and ob
ligations attached to 
the possession of nationality
 of their country of residence; and 
persons in respect 
of whom there are 
serious  reasons  for  considering  that  they  have  committed  a  crime  against  peace,  a  war  crime,  a  
crime  against  humanity,  a  serious  non-political  cr
ime,  or  acts  contrary  to  the  purposes  and  
principles of the United Nations. 
Executive  Committee  of  the  High
  Commissioner’s  Programme  (ExCom)
:  A  Committee  
charged  with  advising  the  Hi
gh  Commissioner  on  the  exercise  of
  her/his  functions.  ExCom  is  
currently  (July  2005)  composed  of  
representatives  of  68  States  with
  a  demonstrated  interest  in  
refugee  issues,  and  23
States  with  observer  stat
us.  NGOs  have  observer  st
atus  in  the  Executive  
Committee. 
Executive  Committee  Conclusions  
on  International  Protection
:  Formal  texts  that  embody  the  
results  of  ExCom’s  annual  deliberations  on  ques
tions  of  refugee  protection.  Although  not  legally  
binding,  ExCom  conclusions  contribute  to  the  elaboration  of  principles  and  standards  for  the  
protection of refugees and other persons of concern to UNHCR. 
Expulsion
:  Removal  of  a  lawful  resident  from  the  te
rritory  of  a  State  by  government  authorities.  
Under  Article  32  of  the  1951  Convention,  national  
security  and  public  order  are  the  only  
permissible  grounds  for  the  expulsion  of  a  ref
ugee.  The  procedures  by  which  a  decision  for  
expulsion is reached should be fair and just, and 
the refugee should be allowed a reasonable time to 
seek admission into another country.

F 
Family Unity Principle
: A principle that gives effect to the protection of the family as the natural 
and  fundamental  group  unit  of  society,  as  descri
bed  in  Art  16  of  the  Un
iversal  Declaration  of  
Human Rights. Under this principle, refugee status
 may be granted to the 
spouse and dependents of 
a  person  who  meets  the  refugee  criteria.  When  s
pouses  and  dependents  acquire  refugee  status  by  
application of the family unity principle, th
ey are said to enjoy “derivative status”. 
Family  Reunification:*  
The  process  of  bringing  together  families,  particularly  children  and  
elderly  dependents  with  previous  
care-providers  for  the  purpose  of  
establishing  or  re-establishing  
long-term  care.  Separation  of  families  occurs  
most  often  during  armed  conflicts  or  massive  
displacements of people.  
Fixing
: A rapid and approximate means of defining a
nd limiting a target population so that persons 
of concern can be more readily identified for furt
her registration, using fixi
ng tokens, wristbands or 
ink marking. 
Fixing Token
: A pre-printed card, issued to individual refugees, in order to define their entitlement 
to registration. No information is collect
ed during a distribution of fixing tokens. 
Focus  Group  Discussion
:  A  method  to  collect  qualitative  data/informa
tion  from  a  group  of  
persons pre-selected according to specific criteria. 
G 
Gender-Related  Persecution
:  Persecution  that  targets  or  disp
roportionately  affects  a  particular  
gender.  Under  certain  factual  ci
rcumstances,  gender-related  pers
ecution  may  come  within  the  
refugee definition. 
Global Consultations on International Protection
: A process launched by UNHCR in late 2000 
to  reinvigorate  the  refugee  protection  framew
ork  by  reaffirming  its  fundamental  components,  
clarifying disputed notions, and developing furthe
r operational approaches to address contemporary 
challenges.  UNHCR,  States,  intern
ational  organizations,  NGOs  and  
refugees  were  all  involved.  
Outcomes have included the 2001 Ministerial 
Declaration and the Ag
enda for Protection. 
Good  Practice
:  An  innovative,  interesting  
and  inspiring  practice  that  
has  the  potential  to  be  
transferred in whole or in pa
rt to other national contexts. 
Group-Based Protection Responses
: Approaches whereby the prot
ection and assistance needs of 
refugees   are   addressed   without   previously   dete
rmining   their   status   on   an   individual   basis.   
Appropriate  where  asylum-seekers  arrive  
en  masse  
and  individualized  pro
cedures  are  neither  
feasible nor necessary (the cause 
of flight often being 
self-evident). The two main approaches are 
recognition of refugee status on a 
prima facie 
basis and the provision of temporary protection. 
Group Determination of Refugee Status
: A practice by which all persons forming part of a large-
scale  influx  are  regarded  as  refugees  on  a  
prima  facie  
basis.  Group  determination  ensures  that  
protection and assistance needs are met without
 prior individual status determination.

11
Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement
: A series of principles that articulate standards for 
protection,  assistance  and  solutions  for  internally  
displaced  persons.  The  Guiding  Principles  were  
presented to the Commission on Human Rights by th
e Representative of the Secretary General for 
Internally Displaced Persons in April 1998. They re
flect and are consistent 
with human rights law, 
humanitarian   law   and   refugee   law,   and   provi
de   guidance   to   States,   other   authorities,   
intergovernmental, and non-governmental organizations 
faced with issues of internal displacement. 
H 
Host Communities:* 
Communities that host large populations of
 refugees or internally displaced 
persons, typically in camps or inte
grated into households directly. 
Household
: A group of persons who share accommodation.
Humanitarian Assistance (Relief
): Aid that addresses the immediat
e needs of individuals affected 
by crises and is provided mainly by non-govern
mental and international organizations. 
Human Capital
: A person’s skills and abilities. 
Humanitarian  Coordination:*  
An  approach  based  on  the  belief  that  a  coherent  response  to  an  
emergency  will  maximize  its  benefits  and  mini
mize  potential  pitfalls.  In  each  country,  the  
coordination  of  UN  humanitarian  assistance  is  entrusted  to  th
e  UN  Resident  and  Humanitarian  
Coordinator.  OCHA,  under  the  dire
ction  of  the  Emergency  Relief  C
oordinator,  is  responsible  for  
the  coordination  of  a  humanitarian  response  in  th
e  event  of  a  crisis  and  
carries  out  this  role  
according  to  approved  policies  and  structures  
set  by  the  IASC.  This  coordination  involves  
developing common strategies with
 partners both within and outsi
de the UN system, identifying 
overall humanitarian needs, developing a realistic 
plan of action, monitoring progress and adjusting 
programmes   as   necessary,   convening   coordination   forums,   mobilizing   resources,   addressing   
common problems to humanitarian actors, and administering coordination mech
anisms and tools. It 
does not involve OCHA in the administ
ration of humanitarian assistance. 
Human  Development  Index  (HDI)
:  a  measure  of  a  country  or  region’s  progress  in  terms  of  life  
expectancy, level of educati
on and adjusted real income. 
Humanitarian  Principles:*  
As  per  UN  General  Assembly  Resolution  46/182  (19  December  
1991),  humanitarian  assistance  must  be  provided  in
  accordance  with  the  principles  of  humanity,  
neutrality and impartiality. Adherence to these pr
inciples reflects a measure of accountability of the 
humanitarian community. 
Human Rights
: Agreed international standards that rec
ognize and protect the 
dignity and integrity 
of every individual, without any distinction. Human 
rights form part of customary international law 
and  are  stipulated  in  a  variety  
of  national,  regional  and  internat
ional  legal  documents  generally  
referred  to  as  human  rights  instruments.  The  mo
st  prominent  of  these  are  the  United  Nations  
Charter,  and  the  UN  Bill  of  Rights,  made  up  of
  the  Universal  Declarati
on  of  Human  Rights,  the  
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Internati
onal Covenant on Economic 
and Social Rights.

s  of  armed  conflicts,  situations  of  
generalized violence, violations of
 human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have 
not crossed an internationally recognized State border”. 
Internal  Disturbance

Internal Flight Alternative
 (or “
Relocation Principle
”): A factual determination that an asylum-
seeker could have avoided persecuti
on in his country of origin by re
locating to another part of the 
same  country.  This  term  is  not  favoured  by  UNHCR  as  it  is  often  used  to  limit  access  to  status  
determination  procedures  or  to  deny  refugee  st
atus.  UNHCR’s  position  is  th
at  the  possibility  of  
internal relocation is relevant to status determin
ation only in certain limited cases. Even when it is 
relevant, its application will depend on a full consid
eration of all aspects of the refugee claim. 
International Humanitarian Law
 (or 
Law of Armed Conflict
): The body of law, regulations and 
principles  that  governs  situations
  of  international  or  non-interna
tional  armed  conflict.  The  core  
instruments of international human
itarian law are the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 
and  their  two  Additional  Protocols  of  8  June  1977.  Virtually  every  State  is  a  party  to  the  Geneva  
Conventions of 1949. 
International Protection
:
The actions by the international community on the basis of international 
law,  aimed  at  protecting  the  fundamental  rights  
of  a  specific  category  of  persons  outside  their  
countries of origin, who lack the nati
onal protection of their own countries. 
Protection:* 
A  concept  that  encompasses  all  activities  
aimed  at  obtaining  full  respect  for  the  
rights  of  the  individual  in  accordance  with  the  le
tter  and  spirit  of  human  rights,  refugee  and  
international  humanitarian  law.  Protection  involves  creating  an  e
nvironment  conducive  to  respect  
for human beings, preventing and/or 
alleviating the immediate effects of
 a specific patte
rn of abuse, 
and restoring dignified conditi
ons of life through reparation, re
stitution and rehabilitation. 
Protection  of  Civilians  in  Armed  Conflict:*  
Structures  and  policies  developed  by  the  UN,  
States  and  other  humanitarian  actors,  and  based  
in  international  humanitarian  law,  human  rights  
and refugee law, to protect vulnerable populations 
from the effects of armed conflict, ranging from 
the  most  immediate  priorities  of  minimizing  civi
lian  casualties  to  more  l
ong-term  priorities  of  
promoting the rule of law and securi
ty, law and order within a State. 
International   Refugee   Law
:   The   body   of   customary   international   law   and   international   
instruments that establishes standa
rds for refugee protection. The co
rnerstone of refugee law is the 
1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol rela
ting to the Status of Refugees. 
Involuntarily  Relocated  Persons  (IRPs)
:  Persons,  who  are  forced  to  
relocate  to  the  country  of  
their citizenship as a result of circumstances threat
ening their lives such as armed conflict, internal 
disorder,  inter-ethnic  tension  or  
systematic  violations  of  human  
rights  and  who  are  in  need  of  
assistance to resettle in their countries of citizenship. 
Irregular  Movement  of  Refugees
:  The  phenomenon  of  refugees  or  asylum-seekers  moving  
illegally from a first country of asylum, in order 
to seek asylum or permanent settlement in another 
country. 
Interactive  Process
:  The  continual  refinement  of  object
ives  as  new  knowle
dge  and  questions  
generated by investigation and analysis f
eed back into the investigative cycle.

J 
Joint Programming
: The process through which the UN country
 team and national partners work 
together to prepare, implement, monitor and evalua
te the UN’s contribution to most effectively and 
efficiently  achieve  the  Millennium  Developmen
t  Goals  and  other  international  commitments  
related to the government’s na
tional development targets. 
K 
Key  Informants
:  Individuals  of  a  particular  background  (e.g.  nurses,  teachers  and  poor  farmers)  
who provide their view
s on various issues. 
L 
Livelihoods
:  A  combination  of  the  resources  used  and  th
e  activities  undertaken  in  order  to  live.  
Resources  include  individual  skills  (human  capital)
,  land  (natural  capita
l),  savings  (financial  
capital),  equipment  (physic
al  capital),  as  well  as  formal  s
upport  groups  and  informal  networks  
(social capital). 
Limitations  of  Human  Rights
:  Many  human  rights  are  not  abso
lute.  Human  rights  instruments  
themselves often contain provisions (of a general as well as a specific nature) limiting these. At the 
national  level,  Constitutions  ofte
n  contain  similar  limitations  or  have  been  interpreted  as  such  
through  judicial  interpretation.  
In  all  cases  
however,  limitations  on  civil  rights  
may  only  
be 
imposed if the following conditions are satisfied: 
-
the limitation must be prescrib
ed by (i.e. provided for or in
 conformity with) the law; 
-
it must be “necessary” for achievi
ng one of the listed
 purposes (such as 
protection of public 
health).  The  burden  lies  with  
the  government  to  prove  that
  the  limitation  is  both  required  
and proportional to the specific 
purpose it aims to achieve; 
-
the limitation may not be so severe as to 
totally suppress the exer
cise of the right. 
Local  Integration
:  A  durable  solution  to  the  problem  of  
refugees  that  involves  their  permanent  
settlement in a country of first asylum, and even
tually being granted nati
onality of that country. 
M 
Mandate Refugees
: Persons who are recognized as ref
ugees by UNHCR acting under the authority 
of  its  Statute  and  relevant  UN  
General  Assembly  resolutions.  Ma
ndate  status  is  especially  
significant in States that ar
e not parties to the 1951 Conve
ntion or its 1967 Protocol. 
Migrants (Economic)
: Persons who leave their c
ountries of origin purely for economic reasons not 
in  any  way  related  to  the  refugee  definition,  or  in
  order  to  seek  material  improvements  in  their  
livelihood. Economic migrants do not fall within the criteria for refug
ee status and are therefore not 
entitled to benefit from intern
ational protection as refugees. 
Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)
:  A  summary  of  development  goals  set  at  international  
conferences and world summits during the 1990s.
