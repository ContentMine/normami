Introduction </b> <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i> is one of industry&#8217;s most used &#8220;workhorses&#8221; and has been used for centuries in  food fermentation for the production of  e.g.,  sake,  soy sauce and other traditional  Asian  foods  [1].  <i> </i> <i>A. oryzae </i> is also a widely used organism for production of amylase, lipases and proteases and more  recently also for heterologous expression of secondary metabolite genes and non-fungal proteins [2&#8211;4].  For  many  years,  <i>A.  oryzae  </i> has been  suspected  to  be a  domesticated  form  of   <i>A.  flavus</i> , a  plant  and  mammalian pathogenic saprophyte, capable of producing some of the most carcinogenic compounds  known:  the  aflatoxins.  Genetic  work  and  subsequent  genome  sequencing  of  strains  of  both  species  have verified the tight link between the species [1,5&#8211;8].  The  relationship  of  the  two  species  has  resulted  in  extensive  screening  of  the  toxic  potential  of  <i> </i> <i>A. oryzae</i> , but no genuine evidence of aflatoxin production in validated  <i>A. oryzae </i> isolates has ever  been shown. Other important toxins, known from  <i>A. flavus</i> , have on the other hand been shown in  <i> </i> <i>A. oryzae</i> : 3-Nitropropionic acid [9] and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) [10] along with kojic acid [11,12]  (Figure 1). Additional metabolites previously reported from  <i>A. oryzae </i> are asperfuran [13], sporogen  AO1 [14,15], maltoryzine [16], and aspergillomarasmine A [17,18]. Aspirochlorine has been found in  <i>A. flavus</i> ,  <i>A. oryzae </i> and  <i>A. tamarii</i>  [19&#8211;23] (Figure 1). For reviews on the safety and taxonomy of   <i>A. oryzae</i> , see [7,24&#8211;26].  <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.10.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.10.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.11.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.11.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>3-nitropropionic acid <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.13.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.13.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>Kojic acid <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.15.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.15.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.16.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.16.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>Maltoryzine <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.18.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.2.18.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>Asperfuran   Sporogen AO1 Aspergillomarasmine A Aspirochlorin   <i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <b>41</b>   The few predicted differences between the genomes of  <i>A. oryzae </i> and  <i>A. flavus </i> (ca. 99.5% genome  homology and 98% at the protein level for RIB40/ATCC 42149 and NRRL 3357 [27]), could lead one  to expect  <i>A. oryzae </i> to produce most of the metabolites found in  <i>A. flavus</i>  [1,28&#8211;31], but published  metabolic data indicates a very low chemical correlation [32]. It is with reference to the established  genetic heritage of  <i>A. oryzae </i> from  <i>A. flavus </i> remarkable that maltoryzine, sporogen AO1, asperfuran  and aspergillomarasmine A have never been unambigously identified in  <i>A. flavus</i> . Though research on  <i>A.  flavus  </i> chemistry  has  focused  primarily  on  toxic  compounds,  one  would  expect  that  these  metabolites should be part of its chemical potential as they are for the domesticated  <i>A. oryzae</i> . The  preliminary bioinformatic studies in conjunction with the genome sequencing shows roughly the same  number of predicted genes: 32 Polyketide synthases (PKSs) and 28 non-ribosomal synthases (NRPSs)  for  <i>A. flavus </i> and 32 PKSs and 27 NRPSs for  <i>A. oryzae  </i> with 2 NRPSs apparently unique for each   strain [33]. The exclusiveness of these genes in terms of end product has yet to be verified chemically.  Most of the predicted genes for secondary metabolites of  <i>A. oryzae </i> (or  <i>A. flavus</i> ) have not been  mapped to specific metabolic products, despite the genome sequencing of RIB40 in 2005 [27]. Only  genes of the most important toxins: Aflatoxin [31,34,35], CPA [36,37] and aflatrem [38] have been  fully annotated in both species, which leaves much to be explored. The full chemical potential of either  species  is  unknown  and  epigenetic  modifiers  [39&#8211;43]  may  be  necessary,  alongside  with  the  use  of  different growth conditions to aid triggering the full potential of secondary metabolite expression in  these two closely related species.  The  aim  of  the  current  work  has  been  to  perform  an  initial  comparative  investigation  of  the  chemistry from the two genome sequenced strains of  <i>A. oryzae </i> (RIB40) and  <i>A. flavus </i> (NRRL 3357), in  order  to  get  further  insights  into  possible  homologies  and  differences  in  secondary  metabolite  production for these two important species.  <p/><b>2. Results and Discussion </b> <i>2.1. De-Replication of A. oryzae RIB40 </i> For  the  analysis  of   <i>A.  oryzae  </i> RIB40  chemistry,  we  investigated  a  series  of  solid  media  (YES,  YESBEE,  DRYES,  CYA,  CYAS,  CY20,  CY40,  DUL,  GAK,  GMMS,  MEA,  OAT,  PDA,  TGY,  WATM (see Methods and Materials for explanation) cultivations with micro-scale extractions [44,45]  and  subsequently  analyzed  with  HPLC-DAD-MS  for  selection  of  optimal  conditions.  The  different  media were tested on a collection of  <i>A. oryzae </i> (RIB40, IBT 28103) and  <i>A. flavus </i> (NRRL 3357, IBT  23106, IBT 3642) and these strains were cultivated at 25 &#176;C in the dark for 7 and 14 days. The media  screening for  <i>A. oryzae </i> and  <i>A. flavus </i> indicated the greatest chemodiversity and metabolite production  from CYA, YES and WATM agar for our purpose.  The comparison of the secondary metabolite profiles of the two strains, NRRL 3357 and RIB40,  exposed a surprisingly high degree of chemical difference on all media as illustrated in Figure 2 and  Table 1 for the WATM medium. The major metabolite repetitions between the two genome sequenced  strains were merely kojic acid and ergosterol, like a number of minor metabolites (not analyzed here)  seemed to be shared between the two strains. Altogether, this is in sharp contrast to the high gene  homology, particularly for the secondary metabolite genes.    in the beginning of chromatogram and ergosterol in the end (not shown), there are very few  identical compounds between the genetically almost identical strains. Note that aspirochlorine  is only detectable in negative ionization, and therefore not visible in this chromatogram.  <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.4.2.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.4.2.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>  presence of these types of compounds in  <i>A. flavus</i>  based on UV spectroscopic analysis.   * New compounds reported here for the first time.  <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.4.6.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.4.6.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <b>43</b>   Known  metabolites  to  <i>A.  oryzae  </i> were  de-replicated  and  we  found  that  the  RIB40  strain  did  not  produce  detectable  levels  (LC-MS)  of  CPA  (as  also  noted  by  Tokuoka   <i>et  al.</i>   [36]),  asperfuran,  sporogen AO1, maltoryzine or aspergillomarasmine under these growth conditions. It did, however,  produce kojic acid and aspirochlorine and a series of potentially new metabolites of which some were  isolated, structurally characterized and reported here.  <i>2.2. New Metabolites to A. oryzae RIB40 </i> During  fermentation  of  the  chemically  potent  RIB40  strain,  we  have  been  interested  in  the  tremorgenic  compounds,  allegedly  coupled  to  fungal  sclerotia  [46&#8211;54]  and  whether  these  could  be  found  in   <i>A.  oryzae  </i> as  they  have  been  in   <i>A.  flavus</i> .  The  RIB40  strain  produces  large  and  abundant  sclerotia, especially on WATM agar, a fact not widely announced in literature although sclerotia have  been observed in  <i>A. oryzae </i> sporadically [55&#8211;57]. No sclerotia were observable after 14 days on YES  agar,  but  although  these  metabolites  are  often  characterized as sclerotial metabolites, there is not a  strict correlation between the biosynthesis of these metabolites and the formation of sclerotia, as also  noted by Wilson [58], and this extract was used for the described isolations.  Here, we report the discovery of the aflatrem precursor 13-desoxypaxilline (13-dehydroxypaxilline)  in   <i>A.  oryzae  </i> RIB40,  originally  isolated  from   <i>Penicillium  paxilli</i>   [59&#8211;63].  Aflatrem  is  known  from  <i> </i> <i>A.  flavus  </i> and  was  discovered  by  Wilson  and  Wilson  in  1964  [64]  and  structure  elucidated  by   Gallagher  <i>et al.</i>  in 1978 and 1980 [65,66]. 13-desoxypaxilline was present in YES, CYA, OAT and  WATM agar 7 day old micro-scale extracts. From the 14 days old YES 200 plate extract used for  isolation, 13-desoxypaxilline was recovered as an intermediate metabolite. LC-MS, LC-MS/MS and  NMR  data  analysis  (Supplementary  Material)  confirmed  the  structure.  Naturally  the  prospect  of  finding aflatrem itself was investigated, though no apparent peak was visible in HPLC-DAD data files.  The use of a LC-MS/MS method further confirmed 13-desoxypaxilline as an end-product of  <i>A. oryzae </i> RIB40  for  the  above  cultivation  conditions,  since  none  of  the  proposed  intermediate  steps  towards  aflatrem  could  be  detected  (LC-MS/MS)  and  only  one  sample  (WATM,  7d)  showed  traces  of  paspaline, a precursor for 13-desoxypaxilline (Figure 3).  <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.11.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.11.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.12.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.12.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.13.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.13.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.14.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.5.14.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <b>44</b>   A second extract was made from 100 plates of a 14-day old  <i>A. oryzae </i> RIB40 culture grown on  WATM  agar  with  abundant  sclerotia  formation  to  validate  the  findings  from  the  YES  extract.  The  analysis  of  the  WATM  extract  showed  13-desoxypaxilline  as  a  major  metabolite  alongside  other  sclerotium-related metabolites, such as aflavinines (based on UV-data not shown). The discovery of  13-desoxypaxilline as the apparent end-product of  <i>A. oryzae </i> RIB40 is in agreement with the analysis  of Nicholson  <i>et al.</i>  [38], who showed that a frameshift mutation in the  <i>atmQ</i>  gene presumably accounts  for 13-desoxypaxilline not being converted into paspalicine and paspalinine. This mutation is therefore  likely responsible for terminating the aflatrem biosynthesis in RIB40 prematurely, short of the acetal  ring  closure,  C-13  hydroxylation  and  isoprene  attachment.  Nicholson   <i>et  al.</i>   [38]  demonstrated  that  AtmQ is a multifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase likely to catalyze the several oxidative  steps needed for biosynthesis of the acetal ring present in the structures of paspalicine, paspalinine and  aflatrem, altogether pointing towards a more complex biosynthesis than shown here. Contrary to our  discovery, Nicholson  <i>et al.</i>  did not find the aflatrem gene cluster of RIB40 to be transcribed during  their fermentations [38].  The isolated 13-desoxypaxilline is a member of the paspalitrem tremorgens, a widely distributed  group  of  metabolites  that  have  been  isolated  from  several  genera:   <i>Penicillium</i> ,   <i>Eupenicillium</i> ,  <i>Claviceps</i> ,   <i>Emericella</i> ,   <i>Aspergillus  </i> and   <i>Phomopsis</i>   [67&#8211;69].  Besides  the  tremorgenic  activity  in  animals,  these  metabolites  have  been  shown  to  be  insecticides  [68],  which  is  believed  to  be  their  ecological function together with aflatoxin and CPA for protection of the sclerotia against fungivorous  insects [46,47].  In addition to 13-desoxypaxilline, two new analogues of parasiticolide A were also isolated and are  here reported for the first time. The metabolites showed to be dide- and 14-deacetoxy analogues, and  are most likely precursors to the sesquiterpene parasiticolide A (= astellolide A) (see Figure 4). The  metabolites were present in CYA, YES and WATM extracts and isolated from the same 14 day old  YES extract as 13-desoxypaxilline, and the dide- and 14-deacetyl analogues were also found in the  sclerotia  enriched  WATM  extract.  Again  the  metabolites  were  analyzed  using  LC-MS  and  NMR.  Several  different  extraction  procedures  were  tested  to  verify  the  correctness  of  the  compounds  as  genuine metabolites and not as  <i>in vitro</i>  degraded parasiticolide A products, but all samples showed  only dide- and 14-deacetyl parasiticolide A and no traceable (LC-MS) levels of parasiticolide A itself,  even  with  different  non-acidic  extractions.  Parasiticolide  A  have  been  isolated  from   <i>A.  flavus  </i> var.  <i>columnaris</i>  (FKI-0739) once [71] and was originally isolated and characterized from  <i>A. parasiticus </i> (IFO 4082) [72,73] and later also from a mutant of  <i>Emericella variecolor </i> (=  <i>A. stellatus </i> Curzi) [74].  Recently  parasiticolides  have  been  detected  in  the  newly  described  species   <i>A.  arachidicola</i>   (CBS  117610)  and   <i>A.  minisclerotigenes  </i> (CBS  117635)  [75].  There  have  to  our  knowledge  not  been  published  any  toxic  studies  on  the  parasiticolides,  but  the  related  peniopholides  from  the  fungus  <i>Peniophora polygonia </i> have been reported to have antifungal properties [76].  <p/><b> </b>   <i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <p/><b>45</b>   <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.7.4.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.7.4.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><i>A.  flavus</i>   and  may  need  epigenetic  modification  to  be  expressed  under  otherwise  normal  growth  conditions.  It  is  interesting  that  parasiticolide  A  is  scarcely  observed  in   <i>A.  flavus</i> ,  when  it  is  an  important  product  of   <i>A.  oryzae  </i> and  also  of   <i>A.  parasiticus</i> .  As  for  13-desoxypaxilline,  dide-  and   14-deacetyl parasiticolide A are almost certainly products of a prematurely ended biosynthesis, here  parasiticolide A. We also isolated and elucidated a third parasiticolide A analogue; a formyl variant of  parasiticolide  A,  but  it  was  not  possible  to  exclude the  possibility  of  in  vitro  chemistry  due  to  the  formic acid added during the ethyl acetate extraction, so the correctness of this metabolite remains  tentative. (Hamasaki  <i>et al.</i>  used benzene to extract parasiticolide A [77]). All paraciticolide analogues  were structure elucidated by NMR and shift values correlated with the published data for parasiticolide  A, except for the missing signals of the acetate units and their minor influence on the chemical shifts  values of adjacent protons and carbons (See Supplementary Material for NMR data).  To  further  verify  these  observations,  a  MS/MS  method  was  used  to  analyze  several  different  microscale extracts of RIB40 for parasiticolide A itself. Trace amounts of parasiticolide A was found  under these conditions and compared to an isolate of  <i>A. parasiticus </i> (IBT 4387) capable of producing  parasiticolide  A.  In  the   <i>A.  parasiticus  </i> isolate  no  dide-  or  14-deacetyl  parasiticolide  A  could  be  measured, indicating a complete transformation into the end-product (Figure 4). The small amount of  parasiticolide A in RIB40 (roughly 1:1.000 ratio compared to 14-acetyl parasiticolide A, presuming the  same response factor) might be the result of spontaneous acetylation involving the first acetylating  enzyme. When the gene cluster of this metabolite is mapped, it is likely that the gene responsible for  the last (specific) acetylation will be found to be mutated. Except for the section  <i>Nidulantes</i>  member  <i>Emericella variecolor</i> , all other producers of these metabolites have been members of section  <i>Flavi</i> .  No  indication  points  to  these  metabolites  being  part  of  the  previously  mentioned  sclerotium  metabolites  since  they  are  not  found  in  selective  sclerotium  extracts,  but  are  found  for  example  in  <i> </i> <i>A. arachidicola</i> , which is not known to produce sclerotia.  Four  new   <i>A.  flavus</i>   related  NRPS  compounds  were  also  isolated  from   <i>A.  oryzae  </i> RIB40  and  characterized  based  on  standard  interpretation  of   <sup>1</sup> H,  COSY,  HMQC  and  HMBC  NMR  data  (see  Supplementary Material). The compounds showed to be two isomeric metabolites named ditryptoleucine  related to the ditryptophenalines [78&#8211;81] and the two indole-enamides named oryzamides A <sub>1-2</sub>  ( <i>cis</i> -  and  <i>trans</i> -forms) structurally similar to the antibiotic miyakamide B <sub>1-2</sub>  [71] (Figure 5).  <p/><b> </b>   <i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <p/><b>46</b>   <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.8.4.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.8.4.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>Marfey analysis of the amino acid derived compounds only established the presence of  L -tyrosine in  the oryzamides. NMR structural data on the trans isomer (A <sub>1</sub> ) is present in the supporting material.  Intriguingly,  these   <i>A.  oryzae  </i> metabolites  have  apparently  exchanged  phenylalanine  with  leucine  compared to the similar  <i>A. flavus</i>  metabolites, indicating either a common trait in the domestication  process or a coupling between the two pathways. The diketopiperazine ditryptoleucine was isolated in  two  variants  with   <sup>1</sup> H-NMR  shifts  varying  around  the  C-C  dimeric  bond,  but  with  the  same  base  structure.  This  unspecific  dimerization  is  in  line  with  previously  isolated  compounds.  A  hybrid  between the ditryptophenaline and ditryptoleucine was isolated from an  <i>Aspergillus </i> sp. as WIN 64745,  with both a phenylalanine and leucine moiety, but with no  <i>N</i> -methylation [79]. These compounds were  tested and proved antagonistic against substance P at the NK1 receptor [82]. The oryzamides A <sub>1-2</sub>  are  variants of the miyakamides B <sub>1-2</sub>  [71]. The exchanged phenylalanine has been substituted with leucine  between a tryptophan and a tyrosine in the oryzamides. However this exchange of phenylalanine and  leucine has often been found for compounds produced within the same species.  <i>Penicillium polonicum</i>   (=  <i>P. fructigenum</i> ) [83-85] produces both fructigenine A = puberuline = rugulosuvine A, containing  phenylalanine  and  fructigenine  B  =  verrucofortine,  containing  leucine.  We  could  also  detect  two  slightly later eluting compounds in the  <i>A. oryzae </i> RIB40 extracts likely to be two further indole-enamides  having phenylalanine incorporated instead of tyrosine as evident from LC-DAD-MS analysis (data not  shown) as also seen for the miyakamides [71].  <p/><b>3.

The sclerotia were washed several times with Milli-Q (Millipore, Millford, USA) 0.22 &#181;m H <sub>2</sub> O and  dried. The sclerotia were transferred to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube together with three stainless steel balls  (2  &#215;  1  mm  and  1  &#215;  5  mm)  and  frozen  with  liquid  N <sub>2</sub>   before  mechanical  crushed.  The  pulverized  sclerotia  were  suspended  in  1mL  methanol  and  transferred  to  a  2  mL  vial  with  1  mL  of  1:2:3  methanol:dichloromethane:ethylacetate and left for evaporation overnight in a fume hood. The dried  extract was resolved in 1 mL methanol in ultrasonicated for 10 min and then filtered with a 0.45 &#181;m  PTFE filter to a clean vial for analysis.  <i>3.5.

For general procedures see [86], method 1.  <i>3.6. NMR Instrumentation </i> NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm  probe using standard pulse sequences. The signals of the residual solvent protons and solvent carbons  were used as internal references ( <i>&#948;</i> <sub>H</sub>  2.50 and  <i>&#948;</i> <sub>C</sub>  39.5 ppm for DMSO). In cases where higher field was  needed the NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a  5-mm  TCI  Cryoprobe  at  the  Danish  Instrument  Center  for  NMR  Spectroscopy  of  Biological  Macromolecules.  <i>3.7. MS/MS Method Used for Aflatrem and Parasiticolide Screening </i> Liquid  chromatography  was performed  on  an Agilent  (Torrence,  CA,  USA)  1100  HPLC  system  coupled to a triple-quadropole mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK) with a Z-spray  ESI  operated in positive  mode source using a flow of 700 L/h nitrogen  desolvated  at 350  &#176;C.  The  hexapole  was  held  at  50  V.  The  system  was  controlled  by  MassLynx  v4.1  (Waters-Micromass).  Nitrogen was used as collision gas, and the MS operated in MRM mode (dwell time = 100 ms) with  the  parameters  listed  in  Table  2.  Extracts  of  2  &#181;L  were  injected  and  separated  on  a  Phenomenex  Gemini C <sub>6</sub> -phenyl, 3 &#181;m, 2 &#215; 50 mm column with a flow of 0.3 &#181;L/min. Water contained 20 mM  ammonium formate. Oven temperature 40 &#176;C. Two different methods were applied to the aflatrem- and  parasiticolide screen: Aflatrem inlet method: Linearly gradient from 50 to 100% MeCN over 5 min,  increased to 0.5 &#181;L/min over 1.5 min. The column was washed additionally 1.5 min with 100% MeCN at  0.5 &#181;L/min, followed by a return to 50% MeCN over 2.5 min and kept at this level for another 1 min  with a linearly decrease in flow to 0.3 &#181;L/min, prior to the next sample. Standards used for analysis of  this pathway were from Sigma-Aldrich Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Parasiticolides: linearly gradient  from 20 to 90% MeCN over 15 min, increased to 0.5&#181;L/min from 90 to 100% MeCN in additional   1 min. The column was washed from 2 min with 100% MeCN at 0.5 &#181;L/min, followed by a return to    <i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <b>50</b>   20% MeCN over 1.5 min and kept at this level for another 3.5 min with a linearly decrease in flow to   0.3 &#181;L/min, before the next sample. Standards were internal standards from other extracts of the known  parasiticolide A producer  <i>A. parasiticus</i> : IBT 4387 (= CBS 260.67) and IBT 11863 (= CBS 115.37).  <div><img src="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.12.3.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/metabolites-02-00039/image.g.12.3.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div><p/><b>4. Conclusions </b> The  tremorgenic  13-desoxypaxilline  has  been  isolated  from   <i>A.  oryzae</i>   RIB40  and  verified  under  several different growth conditions contrary to previous studies. We believe that 13-desoxypaxilline is  the end-product of the aflatrem biosynthesis for the RIB40 strain since no aflatrem could be detected in  any fermentation using LC-MS/MS as detection.  The new metabolites dide- and 14-deacetyl parasiticolide A were also found as genuine products  from  the  RIB40  strain  and  the  compounds  were  present  in  multiple  fermentations,  however  parasiticolide  A  was  only  detected  in  trace  amounts  using  a  LC-MS/MS  method.  This  indicates  a  defective acetylation of the 14-deacetyl parasiticolide A and the small amount of parasiticolide A in  RIB40 could be the result of spontaneous acetylation in the cell cytosol. The mono-deacetylated analogue  detected in both  <i>A. flavus</i>  and  <i>A. oryzae</i>  had same retention times, suggesting a selective acetylation.  The new NRPS compounds ditryptoleucine and oryzamides A <sub>1-2</sub>  appear to be natural variants of  known  <i>A. flavus </i> metabolites. They share the exchange of a phenylalanine for a leucine, although they  are believed to originate from two unrelated pathways.  Altogether, our findings contribute to understanding why the overall chemical profiles of  <i>A. oryzae</i>   (RIB40) and  <i>A. flavus</i>  (NRRL 3357) appear quite different since some of the end-products usually seen  in  <i>A. flavus</i>  are apparently not reached in  <i>A. oryzae</i> . Whether the different chemical profiles are merely    <i>Metabolites</i>   <b>2012</b> ,  <i>2</i>   <b>51</b>   the result of different regulation that can be overcome by the use of epigenetic modifiers or are a result  of genuine mutations remains to be settled.  <i>A. oryzae</i>  RIB40 is clearly a chemically potent strain, and  as more of its chemistry is unfolded we believe that most of the biosynthetic pathways of  <i>A. flavus</i>  will  be  found  to  be  more  or  less  functional.  Future  research  will  reveal  whether  the  many  different  <i> </i> <i>A. oryzae</i>  strains that are used as industrial workhorses are as chemically potent as the RIB40 strain.  <p/><b>Supplementary Materials </b> Supplementary materials can be accessed at: http://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/2/1/39/s1.  <p>see ACKNOWLEDGMENT</p>This  work  was  funded  by  the  Danish  Research  Agency  for  Technology  and  Production  (Grant:   09-064967).
