It is therefore not unexpected that the integration of complex signals from environmental and endogenous cues is necessary to enable plants to time this transition at the most advantageous moment. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, at least four major floral promotion pathways are known to mediate signalling from the different cues: the photoperiod, vernalization, autonomous and gibberellin (GA) pathways <xref rid="pone.0000642-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Of these pathways, the photoperiod pathway plays an important role in controlling the timing of the developmental transition to flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>CONSTANS</italic> (<italic>CO</italic>) is an important floral promoter that acts within the photoperiod pathway <xref rid="pone.0000642-Samach1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It encodes a nuclear protein containing a CCT motif and two B-Box-type zinc-finger domains. The mRNA expression level of <italic>CO</italic> is modulated by the circadian clock and by day-length, and exposure to light is required to activate CO protein function <xref rid="pone.0000642-SuarezLopez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>CO</italic> fulfills the role of a mediator between the photoperiod/circadian clock and the floral integrators. Several upstream regulators of <italic>CO</italic> in photoperiod and circadian clock signalling have been identified. <italic>GIGANTEA</italic> (<italic>GI</italic>) positively mediates signalling from the circadian clock oscillators to <italic>CO</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0000642-Mizoguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. <italic>RED AND FAR-RED INSENSITIVE 2</italic> (<italic>RFI2</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0000642-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <italic>CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1</italic> (<italic>CDF1</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0000642-Imaizumi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA1)</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0000642-Laubinger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> are light signalling molecules controlling <italic>CO</italic> expression downstream of photoreceptors. Although it has been firmly established that <italic>CO</italic> expression is regulated by the photoperiod and circadian clock, the regulation of <italic>CO</italic> expression by other environmental stimuli is poorly understood.</p><p>NAC (NAM, ATAF1, -2, and CUC2)-domain proteins are a class of transcription factors known to control multiple processes in plants, including developmental programs and abiotic/biotic stress responses <xref rid="pone.0000642-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. One of the first reported <italic>NAC</italic> genes, <italic>NO APICAL MERISTEM</italic> (<italic>NAM</italic>) from petunia, plays a critical role in meristem formation <xref rid="pone.0000642-Souer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. As NAC-domain transcription factors are found only in plants, it is highly likely that they are involved in various plant-specific functions. As such, it is not surprising that NAC-domain genes comprise one of the largest transcription factor families in the compact <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome <xref rid="pone.0000642-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, only a small number of the NAC-domain proteins have been studied to date <xref rid="pone.0000642-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and the functions and regulation of most <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC-domain genes are still largely unknown.</p><p>Temperature is an important environmental stimulus that affects flowering time, and an abundance of studies have indicated that it is highly probable that plants use different mechanisms to control flowering time in response to different temperature ranges. The thermosensory pathway genes play a role in regulating flowering in response to ambient growth temperature (moderately elevated or decreased temperatures) <xref rid="pone.0000642-Blazquez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000642-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In response to near-freezing temperatures, plants exhibit cold acclimation or the vernalization response <xref rid="pone.0000642-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The duration of cold exposure to establish these respective responses is different, such that a few days of cold exposure is sufficient to initiate cold acclimation <xref rid="pone.0000642-Thomashow1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, whereas several weeks are required for vernalization <xref rid="pone.0000642-Chouard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It is generally accepted that cold acclimation is necessary for a plant to deal successfully with sudden temperature changes and that vernalization is required to ensure that flowering is inhibited until spring <xref rid="pone.0000642-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of flowering time by vernalization are well understood <xref rid="pone.0000642-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000642-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, many questions have yet to be resolved in terms of cold temperature regulation of flowering time.</p><p>We report here a NAC-domain transcription factor, LOV1, which exerts its inhibitory effect on floral development by negatively regulating <italic>CO</italic> expression in a <italic>GI</italic>-independent manner. Mutations in <italic>LOV1</italic> led to altered responses to freezing temperatures. The loss-of-function <italic>lov1</italic> allele was hypersensitive to cold temperature, whereas a gain-of-function allele was tolerant to cold temperature. The freezing tolerance was attributed to the upregulation of cold response genes without altering expression of the C-repeat-binding factor/dehydration responsive element-binding factor 1 (<italic>CBF/DREB1</italic>) gene family. Based on our results, we propose that <italic>LOV1</italic> plays an important role in the coordination of cold response and flowering time.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>All of the plants used in this study were <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants in the Columbia background, except for <italic>co-2</italic> and <italic>gi-3</italic>, which were in the L<italic>er</italic> background. <italic>gi-2</italic> plants harbouring <italic>35S::GI</italic> transgene were used for <italic>GI</italic> overexpressor plants (genotype: <italic>35S::GI gi-2</italic>).

This possibility of such a binding is supported by the observation that the oscillation patterns of LOV1 protein levels and <italic>CO</italic> mRNA levels were largely in reverse phase to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000642-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000642-g003">3</xref>). However, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay that we performed did not identify the specific binding sites of LOV1 protein within the <italic>CO</italic> promoter sequence; rather, it appeared that LOV1 protein binds non-specifically to the promoter region of <italic>CO</italic> (S.Y.Y. and J.H.A., unpublished results). This suggests that LOV1 may not directly regulate <italic>CO</italic> expression and that <italic>LOV1</italic> may require an additional downstream gene that mediates signalling from <italic>LOV1</italic> to <italic>CO</italic>. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that non-specific binding to the <italic>CO</italic> promoter is required for changes in the chromatin structures of the <italic>CO</italic> locus, thereby leading to downregulation of <italic>CO,</italic> as seen in plant homeodomain finger proteins <xref rid="pone.0000642-Mellor1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>LOV1</italic> appears to control <italic>CO</italic> expression in a pathway that might be distinct from those of the photoperiod pathway and the circadian clock. <italic>CO</italic> is known to integrate the circadian clock and photoreceptor signalling processes in flower development <xref rid="pone.0000642-Samach1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0000642-Mizoguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000642-Valverde1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000642-Imaizumi2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In this study, however, we have shown that alterations in flowering time associated with changes in <italic>LOV1</italic> activity appear to be independent of <italic>GI</italic> and other circadian clock oscillators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000642-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and that <italic>lov1</italic> mutants did not show any significant changes in hypocotyl lengths under different light qualities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000642.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>LOV1</italic> may function in a pathway that does not require the photoreceptor and circadian clock function. This concept is further supported by the observations that <italic>LOV1</italic>'s pattern of regulation of <italic>CO</italic> expression is different from those of previously identified regulators of <italic>CO</italic>, such as the <italic>gi</italic> mutation, which is epistatic to the <italic>rfi2</italic> mutation <xref rid="pone.0000642-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>CO</italic> by SPA1, which is likely short-day specific <xref rid="pone.0000642-Laubinger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000642-Fittinghoff1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, and CDF1, which directly binds to a <italic>cis-</italic>acting motif with the <italic>CO</italic> promoter <xref rid="pone.0000642-Imaizumi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Based on our results, <italic>LOV1</italic> is likely an additional upstream regulator that may mediate different a signalling pathway to <italic>CO</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000642-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000642-g004">4</xref>). Given the fact that <italic>CO</italic> plays a central role in photoperiodic flowering and that the determination of the timing of flowering is critical for plants' successful reproduction, it is not particularly surprising that multiple independent regulators control the expression of <italic>CO</italic> in its function as a regulator of flowering.</p><p>One very interesting observation was that the downregulation of <italic>CO</italic>, a flowering time gene, also led to a tolerance to cold temperature, as this would suggest that <italic>CO</italic> could be an important regulator integrating developmental regulation and the cold stress response. The enhanced tolerance seen in <italic>co</italic> mutants is consistent with the finding that <italic>35S::LOV1</italic> plants are tolerant to cold temperature. Given our result that the overexpression of <italic>LOV1</italic> caused a decrease in <italic>CO</italic> transcript level, it is expected that <italic>LOV1</italic> overexpressor plants and a loss-of-function allele of <italic>CO</italic> exhibit a similar cold response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000642-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This implies that a subset of flowering time genes may play an additional role in the cold response. Consistent with this hypothesis is a recent finding that <italic>GI</italic>, an upstream regulator of <italic>CO</italic>, is involved in the cold stress response <xref rid="pone.0000642-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. <italic>GI</italic> positively regulates tolerance to freezing temperature in a <italic>CBF</italic>-independent pathway, as observed in <italic>lov1</italic> mutants. Thus, it is probable that the canonical photoperiod pathway genes in flower development may play a dual role in flowering time control and the cold response. This may explain, at least partially, the delay or inhibition in the flowering of wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants that are exposed to intermittent cold stress.</p><p>Our proposal that <italic>LOV1</italic> may regulate the cold response is also supported by the observation that <italic>lov1</italic> mutants showed responses similar to those of <italic>hos9</italic> and <italic>sfr6</italic> mutants that are known to involve in cold signalling. <italic>hos9</italic> and <italic>sfr6</italic> mutants display altered sensitivities to freezing stress without affecting <italic>CBF/DREB1</italic> gene expression <xref rid="pone.0000642-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000642-Knight1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, as also seen in <italic>lov1</italic> mutants. An interesting result is that <italic>hos9</italic> mutants also exhibit a flowering time phenotype <xref rid="pone.0000642-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000642-Knight1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>; however, the precise mechanism by which <italic>HOS9</italic> regulates flowering time is unknown. In <italic>sfr6</italic> mutants, expressions of <italic>KIN1</italic> and <italic>COR15A</italic>, which contain the CRT/DRE motif in their promoters, were upregulated, as also seen in <italic>35S::LOV1</italic> plants. It is worth noting that <italic>SFR6</italic> may be a positive regulator of <italic>LOV1</italic> in the cold response since the level of <italic>LOV1</italic> transcripts was significantly decreased in <italic>sfr6</italic> mutants <xref rid="pone.0000642-Boyce1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, the <italic>SFR6</italic> gene has not yet been cloned. Future elucidation of the identity of <italic>SFR6</italic> will facilitate studies aimed at determining whether <italic>SFR6</italic> and <italic>LOV1</italic> act in the same pathway to control cold tolerance or whether they interact with each other to mediate the cold response.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that the <italic>LOV1</italic> encodes a NAC-domain transcription factor that plays a pivotal function in flowering time regulation and cold response. <italic>LOV1</italic> acts as a floral repressor by negatively regulating the transcript level of <italic>CO</italic>, a central regulator of the photoperiod pathway. It also regulates the response of plants to freezing temperature by controlling a subset of cold response genes via a <italic>CBF/DREB1</italic>-independent pathway. Our results suggest a shared mechanism for controlling cold stress response and flowering time in plants and that the regulation of <italic>CO</italic> via <italic>LOV1</italic> may be common for these two distinct responses. Future investigations to determine the precise mechanism by which <italic>LOV1</italic> acts in two intersecting pathways will provide a better understanding of the modulation of reproductive development in plants under continuously changing temperature conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000642.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Physiological responses in <italic>lov1</italic> mutants and wild-type plants.
