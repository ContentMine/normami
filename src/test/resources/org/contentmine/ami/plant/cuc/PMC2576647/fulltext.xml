In this paper, the function of extensins in embryo development was studied in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>. By using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, the extensin JIM20 epitopes were found to express in different developmental stages of embryos, and specifically in the top of the embryo proper (EP) and the suspensor of the late globular embryos. In order to clarify the functions of extensins, a potent hydroxyproline synthesis inhibitor, 3,4-dehydro-<sc>L</sc>-proline (3,4-DHP), was used in ovule and embryo culture. The results showed that the addition of 3,4-DHP caused abnormal embryos with single, asymmetry and supernumerary cotyledon primordia, and continuous culture led to cotyledon defects in the germinated seedlings. Histological sections showed that the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of the abnormal seedlings was dissimilar from the controls, especially in the seedlings with cup-shaped cotyledons. Furthermore, the vasculature of the abnormal cotyledons was in an out-of-order format and contained at least two main veins. Finally, both the hydroxyproline assay and fluorescent immunolocalization confirmed that 3,4-DHP treatment reduced the level of extensins in the cultured ovules and embryos. These results indicate that extensins may play important roles in the cotyledon primordium formation, SAM activity, and vasculature differentiation during embryo development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cotyledon</kwd><kwd>embryo development</kwd><kwd>extensin</kwd><kwd><italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic></kwd><kwd>shoot apical meristem</kwd><kwd>3,4-DHP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extensins are hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins found in many plant cell walls as a major protein component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Varner, 1985</xref>). They are composed of a polypeptide backbone which is extremely rich in hydroxyproline (Hyp) and also contains much serine, lysine, tyrosine, and valine residues, and oligosaccharides of arabinose and galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). This structure is the result of considerable post-translational processing of the polypeptide gene product. Extensin family members exhibit a high degree of post-translational modification (PTM) as more than 50% of the amino acids were glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kieliszewski and Lamport, 1994</xref>). Among the proteins which are present in the plant cell wall, the extensins are implicated in nearly all aspects of plant development. It was found that the expression of extensins and their mRNAs occurred in response to a varieties of biotic and abiotic stresses, such as resistance to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deepak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), ozone (Schneiderbauerf <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995), and superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wisniewski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). There is also some evidence showing that extensins participate in many events during plant development, such as pollen recognition and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), cell division and differentiation, cessation of cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), abscission and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Merkouropoulos and Shirsat, 2003</xref>), and flower organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>).</p><p>In order to provide direct evidence for the functions of extensins, researchers adopted different methods to alter the level of extensins in plant cell walls. A transgenic approach was one of the methods used by some researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Memelink <italic>et al.</italic> (1993)</xref> studied the extensin gene <italic>pCNT1</italic> in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L. with sense and antisense constructs under the control of the <italic>CaMV35S</italic> promoter. In studying the <italic>Atext1</italic> gene in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it was found that increasing the extensin level not only decreased the pathogen invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wei and Shirsat, 2006</xref>), but also affected the inflorescence stem thickness and height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roberts and Shirsat, 2006</xref>). Simultaneously, other methods such as treatment with chemical reagents were also adopted. In hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), most of the Pro residues are hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases and the resulting hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues serve as major sites for oligosaccharide decoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kieliszewski and Lamport, 1994</xref>). Because of this unique biosynthetic pathway, the use of specific inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases could provide a valuable approach for studying the functions of Hyp-rich wall polymers. Such inhibitors should be particularly effective for HRGPs because hydroxylase inhibitors can also block the attachment of carbohydrate side chains, which are shown to be partial determinants of the structure of HRGPs (van Holst and Vamer, 1984; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stafstrom and Staehelin, 1986</xref>). As strongly basic HRGPs, extensins are extremely rich in Hyp, so the treatment with hydroxylase inhibitors will mostly influence the level of extensins in plant cell walls among all types of HRGPs. The chemical 3,4-DHP (3,4-dehydro-<sc>L</sc>-proline) was a potent inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase and functions at micromole concentrations to inactivate prolyl hydroxylase rapidly and irreversibly (Cooper and Vamer, 1983). Previous studies showed that 3,4-DHP inhibited cell wall assembly and cell division in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> mesophyll protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), and in tomato seedlings, the treatment with 3,4-DHP shortened the root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bucher <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In sexual plant reproduction, there are several complex, precise, and key events: pollination, fertilization, and embryogenesis. Previous studies have indicated that hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are potential candidates for mediating pollen&#x02013;pistil interactions in conjunction with partner molecules in female tissues. It has been shown that the reproductive tissues are a rich source of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. For example, Pex1 (pollen extensin-like) protein mainly locates in the pollen tube wall and plays a role in tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rubinstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). CELP (Cys-rich extensin-like protein) has a possible role in the process of pollination and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). PELPIII (Class III pistil-specific extensin-like proteins) abundantly and specifically localize in the intercellular matrix (IM) of tobacco style transmitting tissues, and translocates from IM to the pollen tube wall after pollination, which indicates that the biological function of the glycoprotein is related to pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It was also found that a style-specific 120 kDa protein, which is located in the pistil-grown pollen tubes, was required for S-specific pollen rejection in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hancock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Most glycoproteins have been shown to play roles in pollination, but a few HRGPs have been reported to be involved in embryo development. Up to now, only the RSH (Root&#x02013;Shoot&#x02013;Hypocotyl&#x02013;Defective) extensin protein has been proved to be essential in regulating the accurate positioning of the cell plate during embryogenesis of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Hall and Cannon, 2002). Because embryos reside deep in the ovules, it is difficult to observe the functions of extensins during embryo development <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, very few studies have provided direct and unequivocal evidence for the functions of extensins during embryogenesis of angiosperms. In this paper, an <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo micro-culture system was used to solve this problem. By using an immunofluorescence labelling technique, the temporal and spatial distribution of extensins was detected at different embryonic stages. The biological functions of extensins were also investigated by examining the effects of 3,4-DHP on embryo development. The results showed that the inhibition of extensin synthesis increased the abnormal differentiation of embryos and caused defects of cotyledon and the shoot apical meristem development. These indicate that extensins may play important roles in cotyledon primordial formation and shoot apical meristem activity. This is the first paper that implicates extensins in the development of tobacco embryos.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p><italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L.

One gram fresh weight of ovules at different developmental stages (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 days after pollination, DAP) were taken from the ovaries and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. The ground tissues were placed into 2 ml extraction buffer (0.1 M K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0). After incubation at 4 &#x000b0;C for 3 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min.

Equal amounts of total proteins were loaded in each well. Gels were electroblotted (88 V, 3 h) onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes using electro-transfer buffer (20 mM TRIS-base, 150 mM glycine, 20% methanol). The nitrocellulose membrane blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in TBST buffer (20 mM TRIS-base, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. The membranes were then incubated with the primary monoclonal antibodies (Mb) JIM11, JIM12, JIM19, and JIM20 (1:50) respectively for 2 h at room temperature, and washed with TBST for 3&#x02013;10 min. The JIM11 and JIM20 antibodies recognize specific arabinosylation of HRGPs whereas JIM12 may recognize a protein epitope or a non-terminal oligosaccharide structure (Smallwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994; a kind gift from Dr JP Knox, Centre for Plant Sciences, University of Leeds, UK).

Five millimetre thick transverse sections were cut with a microtome (Sorvall MT-6000 ultramicrotome), and dried on object glasses. Immunoenzyme detection of extensins in the sections used the SABC (streptavidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex) method. The experiments were performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yuan <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> with some modification. The sections were incubated in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (15 min at room temperature, RT) to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. After three 5 min washes with distilled water, the sections were incubated in 10 mM PBS buffer containing 5% BSA (20 min at RT) to block non-specific binding. Then the sections were incubated with 1:5 dilutions (10 mM PBS, 1% BSA, pH 7.2) of extensin antibody at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight, rinsed three times with PBS, and incubated with biotin-labelled goat anti-rat IgG antibody for 20 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. After that, the sections were rinsed three times with PBS and allowed to react with the SABC reagent for 20 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. After an extensive washing in PBS supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 (four times) and PBS (twice), the sections were stained with the AEC kit at RT.

Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were cut using a Sorvall MT-6000 ultramicrotome and collected onto Formvar-coated nickel grids. The grids were floated on PBST buffer (60 mM PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.2) containing 0.2 M glycine and 1% BSA to block non-specific binding.

After 10 d of culture, the embryos in the ovules developed into three types: undifferentiated, normal differentiated, and abnormal differentiated. In 3,4-DHP treated ovules, the frequencies of abnormal differentiated embryos obviously increased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and appeared in a concentration-dependent manner (from 0 to 100 &#x003bc;M). But when the concentration was increased to 200 &#x003bc;M, there was no change in the frequency of abnormal differentiated embryos compared with the treatment with 100 &#x003bc;M. The total differentiation frequencies of embryos in the cultured ovules increased when the 3,4-DHP concentration was 100&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M, but these mainly resulted from the augmentation of abnormal embryo differentiation, normal embryo differentiation showed no visible contribution to the total differentiation frequencies. However, the 50 &#x003bc;M 3,4-DHP concentration showed a remarkably inhibitory effect on the normal embryo differentiation and resulted in the decrease of the total differentiation frequency, which was compared with the untreated control. In general, the normal differentiated embryos had two symmetrical cotyledon primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>), but the abnormal differentiated embryos had asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>), supernumerary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and single cotyledon primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

Because of the high abundance in cell walls and the extremely high level of Hyp, the use of specific inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylase which hydroxylated Pro into Hyp could provide a valuable approach for studying the function of extensins among all types of HRGPs. Unlike most other proline analogues, the potent inhibitor 3,4-DHP functions at micromole concentrations to inactivate prolyl hydroxylase <italic>in vivo</italic> rapidly and irreversibly (Cooper and Vamer, 1983). Studies with an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> proline auxotroph demonstrated that 3,4-DHP was the only Pro analogue tested that could replace proline in the synthesis of enzymically active acid phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris and Schlesinger, 1972</xref>). For 3,4-DHP offers many advantages over other inhibitors, so it becomes a useful tool for studying the physiological and developmental functions of extensins among all types of HRGPs. In our test, the treatment with 100 &#x003bc;M 3,4-DHP significantly reduced the total hydroxyproline level in the cultured ovules about 51.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A similar result was observed in <italic>Allium cepa</italic> L. roots that were treated with 3,4-<sc>DL</sc>-dehydroproline (DP), a specific inhibitor of peptidyl-prolyl hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tullio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). These results indicate that the use of 3,4-DHP or 3,4-<sc>DL</sc>-DP can offer good methods to study the functions of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins in specific tissues and development stages. So, using 3,4-DHP in culture tests primarily to inhibit the synthesis of extensins is an effective way to study their functions in embryo development.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of extensins in embryo development</title><p>Embryogenesis is a critical stage of sporophytes in the plant life cycle, in which many genes and proteins play important roles. In our study, the dramatic change of extensins during tobacco embryo development was detected by Western blot and immunolocalization, and the results indicated that extensins may play roles in embryogenesis. In order to investigate the functions of extensins, the inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase, 3,4-DHP, was applied to the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of ovules and embryos. The results showed that addition of 100&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M 3,4-DHP to the ovule culture increased the total embryo differentiation frequencies, and the enhancement mainly reflected the increase of the abnormal differentiation frequencies. A similar result was also observed in embryo culture when the 3,4-DHP concentration was 5&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M. As 3,4-DHP inhibited the biosynthesis of Hyp and decreased the level of extensins in our tests, the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture results suggested that a low level of extensins could promote cell growth, which was in agreement with the result that removal of cell wall proteins increased extensibility in <italic>Avena sativa</italic> coleoptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruesink, 1969</xref>). In <italic>Allium cepa</italic>, the treatment of roots with a peptidylprolyl hydroxylase inhibitor caused a reduction in the level of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that led to the early elongation of the developing root cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tullio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Conversely, increasing the level of extensins resulted in obviously shorter inflorescences in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roberts and Shirsat, 2006</xref>). Why does reducing the level of cell wall proteins promote cell growth? According to the previous studies, the cell wall comprised three interpenetrating networks: cellulose, pectins, and extensins and our results suggested that the changes to the extensins network may cause the cell wall to loosen and promote cell growth. Similarly, the decrease of the cellulose density stimulated pollen tube growth in <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> and caused them to be slender and straighter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly in our work the frequency of total differentiated embryos decreased when treated with low concentration of 3,4-DHP (50 &#x003bc;M in ovule culture and 2 &#x003bc;M in embryo culture) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). In a widely accepted view, the structure of extensins was partially determined by the attachment of carbohydrate side chains (Cooper and Vamer, 1983), and then the regulation of cell wall extensibility by connecting different extensin structures via covalent and non-covalent cross-links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassab and Varner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schnabelrauch <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). So in our experiment, the frequencies of the normal differentiated embryos that decreased in low concentrations of 3,4-DHP might be due to the partial inhibition of the activity of the prolyl hydroxylase that controlled the synthesis of extensins (Cooper and Vamer, 1983), thereby continuously changed the normal cross-link pattern of extensins into an abnormal pattern, which possibly then inhibited cell growth and differentiation. According to the data of <italic>in vitro</italic> ovule and embryo cultures, the increased frequencies of differentiated embryos induced by high concentrations of 3,4-DHP could be due to the total breakdown of the extensin network, which in turn induced cell wall loosening and promoted cell growth. Our results showed that the 3,4-DHP concentration point of 50 &#x003bc;M in ovules and 2 &#x003bc;M in embryos might be a significant point that influenced the balance of extensin synthesis and correct cross-links, and when the concentration increased, the balance was broken and the network was destroyed. This phenomenon had previously been observed in tomato; the inhibition of the extensin peroxidase activity depressed the hypocotyl height at a lower concentration, but promoted the hypocotyl height at a higher concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownleader <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Together with our observations, these results suggest that the disturbance of the extensin level influenced embryo development under a special concentration effect: low concentrations of 3,4-DHP inhibited embryo differentiation, but high concentrations caused the increase of abnormal differentiated embryos.</p><p>The late globular embryos which were close to the start of differentiation showed an intense extensins signal in the apex of embryo proper (EP) and suspensor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figs 2C, 3B, C</xref>). The polar localization of extensins may reflect the importance of the interaction between the suspensor and the EP, including cell communication, signal transduction, and material transportation. Previous studies indicated that PIN proteins which were putative auxin efflux carriers played important roles during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blilou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have highlighted the roles of cell wall proteins in signal transduction and interactions with the plasma membrane proteins at the cell surface in determining cell fate during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jamet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). For example, the RSH glycoprotein AtEXT3 which was isolated from the cell cultures of wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was critical for normal embryo development (Hall and Cannon, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cannon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In our tests, the globular embryos differentiate into heart embryos where bilateral symmetry of the cotyledon primordia is established, but aberrant differentiation of embryos was found in the ovule culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B&#x02013;D</xref>) when 3,4-DHP was applied. Strong evidence from the embryo culture further confirmed that extensins play important roles in the course of embryo differentiation, and the abnormal differentiated embryos appeared when the extensin synthesis was disturbed. The results of the hydroxyproline assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and the immunolocalization of extensins in embryos isolated from the cultured ovules (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern245/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) further validated that 3,4-DHP could reduce the level of extensins. So according to these results, it is suggested that extensins may play a role in embryo development. Taken together, our results also supported the hypothesis that cell wall proteins may play a function in the interaction between the suspensor and the EP.</p><p>The results from our studies indicated that extensins were essential for normal embryo differentiation, and when its level decreased, the differentiation frequency of the abnormal embryos increased. But, because of the lack of extensin mutants, the mechanism by which extensins play roles in embryo development is still unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of extensins in cotyledon formation and shoot apical meristem activity</title><p>In dicotyledonous plants, the just germinated seedlings exhibit bilateral symmetry, as evidenced by the two symmetrically located cotyledons and a shoot apical meristem (SAM) between the cotyledons. This symmetry can be traced back to early embryogenesis: the shoot meristem originates from the apical region of the radial symmetrical globular embryos, and subsequently the cotyledon primordia begin to form in the flank of the apical region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long and Barton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furutani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), but the mechanism of how they initiate is still unknown. In our studies, extensins were found in the cotyledon primordia of the heart-shaped embryos and the SAM of the torpedo-shaped embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>), which indicated that extensins may play roles in cotyledon primordium formation and SAM activity. In ovule and embryo cultures, the embryos with abnormal cotyledon primordia and the young seedlings with abnormal SAM were observed in the treatment with 3,4-DHP. Seedlings normally germinate with two symmetrical cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>), but the germinated seedlings that had treatment with 3,4-DHP displayed various defects in the cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F&#x02013;I</xref>). According to the results of semi-thin sections and transparency, the single cotyledon seedlings may have two origins: one is that only one cotyledon primordium developed into one normal cotyledon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>); the other is that two cotyledons formed that fused incompletely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, a complete fusion of two cotyledons was found in the cup-shaped seedlings based on the results of venation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7E</xref>). The results showed that the seedlings from the ovules treated with 3,4-DHP had different extents of defects in the cotyledon primordia, and could not germinate when their primordia had extremely serious defects. Meanwhile, the abnormal cotyledons displayed a disorganized venation pattern, and this was also observed in the cotyledon of <italic>cuc1</italic>, <italic>cuc2</italic> and <italic>pin1-3 pid1-2</italic> mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furutani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This indicates that the disorganized venation pattern in cotyledons may also come from the abnormality of the cotyledon primordia.</p><p>Further, the cup-shaped cotyledon seedlings did not mature, therefore, it is speculated that this was due to the interference of extensins, which resulted in the defects of SAM and the mislocalization of cotyledon-forming regions during the development of embryos. In our work, the position and morphology of the SAM in the abnormal cotyledon seedlings induced by 3,4-DHP was investigated and the difference was observed by comparison with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The position of the SAM in the cup-shaped cotyledon seedlings was seriously influenced, which was encircled by a conjoint cotyledon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). So according to these results, it is presumed that the activity of SAM was dependent on the correct position. Therefore, these results indicated that the inhibition of extensins influenced the differentiation of embryos, which led to the unconventionality of cotyledon formation; and for the defects of the cotyledons, the correct positioning of the SAM was imvolved; and finally SAM activity was influenced.</p><p>The present study indicated that extensins play important roles in embryo differentiation, cotyledon primordium formation, and SAM activity, but how they function is still unknown. Further studies need to be done in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
