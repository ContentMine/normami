In peach, two C-class MADS-box genes have been isolated. Both of them are expressed during flower and mesocarp development. Here a detailed analysis of a gene that belongs to the PLENA subfamily of MADS-box genes is shown. The expression of this <italic>PLENA</italic>-like gene (<italic>PpPLENA</italic>) increases during fruit ripening, and its ectopic expression in tomato plants causes the transformation of sepals into carpel-like structures that become fleshy and ripen like real fruits. Interestingly, the transgenic berries constitutively expressing the <italic>PpPLENA</italic> gene show an accelerated ripening, as judged by the expression of genes that are important for tomato fruit ripening. It is suggested that <italic>PpPLENA</italic> might interfere with the endogenous activity of <italic>TAGL1</italic>, thereby activating the fruit ripening pathway earlier compared with wild-type tomato plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>C-type MADS-box genes</kwd><kwd>fruit ripening</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>peach</kwd><kwd><italic>PpPLENA</italic> gene</kwd><kwd><italic>Prunus persica</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>TAGL1</italic> gene</kwd><kwd>transgenic tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The existence of different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants producing fruits with developmental defects has made it possible to gain significant information regarding patterning and post-fertilization development of the fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinneny and Yanofsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dinneny <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Cantabrana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In particular, the use of genetic tools has allowed researchers to demonstrate that many transcription factor encoding genes are involved in the development of the pod dehiscence zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dinneny <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; Ostergaard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Cantabrana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Fleshy fruits have been extensively studied due to their intrinsic economical value. However, those studies have mostly dealt with late stages of fruit development and various aspects of the ripening process (i.e. softening, colour, flavour, etc.). Also the genetic and molecular networks involved in the control of ripening have been extensively studied, since the availability of a command to start and regulate ripening would be of immense economic value. To the latter purpose, it has been found that in climacteric fruits (e.g. tomato) the inability to either synthesize or respond to ethylene results in the inability of the fruit to ripen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giovannoni, 2004</xref>), while no such signal has been found to date in the case of non-climacteric fruit.</p><p>In general, the number of available mutants for studying fleshy fruits is limited since plants producing defective fruits were thrown away because they had no commercial value. Only recently have such mutants started to be properly evaluated and saved, as exemplified by the <italic>fleshless berry</italic> (<italic>flb</italic>) mutant of grape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, tomato represents an exception, and many different mutants have been deposited in dedicated collections (the University of California at Davis has a very important one: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu">http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu</ext-link>).</p><p>The characterization of tomato mutants unable to ripen their fruits has confirmed that ethylene plays an important role, though not an exclusive one. There are mutants [i.e. <italic>nor</italic>, <italic>rin</italic>, and <italic>cnr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tigchelaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; Lincoln and Fisher, 1988; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>)] whose fruits do not produce ethylene and are unable to ripen following treatment with the hormone, even though they have a normal signal transduction machinery for ethylene. This finding suggested that factors, other than ethylene, may play fundamental roles in the ripening process.</p><p>In particular, the <italic>nor</italic> (<italic>non-ripening</italic>) tomato has a mutation that affects a gene encoding a <italic>NAC</italic>-type [<italic>NO APICAL MERISTEM</italic> (<italic><underline>N</underline>AM/<underline>A</underline>TAF1/<underline>C</underline>UC2</italic>)] transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giovannoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), while the <italic>cnr</italic> (<italic>colorless non-ripening</italic>) mutant phenotype has been shown to be the consequence of a natural epigenetic mutation that causes a dramatic down-regulation of an SBP-box transcription factor-encoding gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manning <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the case of the <italic>rin</italic> (<italic>ripening inhibitor</italic>) mutant, it has been demonstrated that the wild-type <italic>RIN</italic> gene codes for a MADS-box protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vrebalov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The latter finding is particularly interesting since it shows that MADS-box genes may play a significant role in the development of fleshy fruits, besides that already evidenced for the dry fruit of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roeder and Yanofsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balanz&#x000e1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seymour <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Homologues of the C-type gene have been found to be expressed in fruits of tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pnueli <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), grape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), strawberry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and others, thus suggesting a possible involvement in fruit development.</p><p>In core eudicots, two lineages of C-type MADS-box genes can be found: the <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> lineage, for which the <italic>Arabidopsis AGAMOUS</italic> and the snapdragon <italic>FARINELLI</italic> genes are the best known representatives; and the <italic>PLENA</italic> lineage which also includes, besides the snapdragon <italic>PLENA</italic> gene, the intensively studied <italic>Arabidopsis SHATTERPROOF</italic> (1 and 2) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liljegren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Favaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kramer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In particular, <italic>PLENA</italic> has been shown to specify the C-function in snapdragon, as <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> does in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, while the <italic>FARINELLI</italic> gene appears to be mostly involved in stamen development and pollen fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that both <italic>AGAMOUS/FARINELLI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and <italic>PLENA/SHATTERPROOF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) orthologues are expressed in peach flower and fruit.

As peach is a woody and recalcitrant species, the fleshy fruit-producing tomato was used to obtain information about the activity of the <italic>PpPLE</italic> gene.</p><p>Transformation of tomato yielded 13 different transgenic plants containing the <italic>PpPLE</italic> coding region under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Interestingly, a mutated phenotype could only be observed at the level of flowers. Three lines produced flowers and fruits that were similar to those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D, F</xref>). Only one such line produced seeds that yielded kanamycin-resistant plants similar to the wild type. Eight primary transformants produced flowers with a mild mutated phenotype that consisted mostly of a calyx where the various sepals tended to be joined together to various degrees throughout their subsequent development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The fused calyx was, however, partly opened at the blossom end, thus allowing a limited anthesis to be visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Four of the above mild lines produced seeds that, in two cases, yielded plants with a stronger phenotype. The remaining transgenic clones showed a particularly severe phenotype, with flower buds that did not open at anthesis because the sepals formed a tube-like structure that allowed only the style/stigma to become visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The reproductive organs were present in all transformants, although in the case of the most severe phenotype the stamens looked partially deformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>), probably due to mechanical constraints. Later during development, the fused calyx was partially opened by the outgrowth of the ovary-derived fruit which ripened normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>) like that of the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>), although seeds were never produced and plants had to be propagated vegetatively. Contrary to what occurred in wild-type plants where the sepals maintained a leaf-like structure throughout the entire life of the fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>), in transgenic plants with a strong phenotype the sepals developed a fleshy structure and became reddish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>, white arrow), thus behaving like ectopic fruits.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Tomato plants constitutively expressing the peach PpPLE (794) cDNA.

The same cDNAs had also been independently obtained in the authors' laboratory from an EST cDNA library (LT and GC, unpublished data) and used as a starting point for the present study. In particular, the cognate genes have been isolated from a peach genomic library, and the resulting structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern313/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), together with protein alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), indicate that the <italic>PPERSHP</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) might actually be an orthologue of <italic>PLENA</italic>, while <italic>PpAG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) appears to be orthologous to <italic>FARINELLI</italic>, reproducing to some extent the situation of <italic>Anthirrinum majus</italic> (snapdragon). Such a conclusion also appears to be supported by a comparison of the percent identity values of the C-type MADS-box proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, snapdragon, and peach, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern313/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Expression analysis and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization demonstrated that both genes are expressed during carpel and stamen development, as expected for C-class genes, thus confirming the RT-PCR data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tani <italic>et al</italic> (2007)</xref>. In contrast, real-time experiments carried out with whole flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) seem to indicate that the <italic>PpPLENA</italic> (<italic>PpPLE</italic>) is more abundant in the carpel, even though its expression domains are overlapping with those of <italic>MADS 462</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Furthermore <italic>PpPLE</italic> expression increases during fruit ripening, while that of <italic>PpFAR</italic> does not. Because of this, <italic>PpPLE</italic> has been studied in more detail. Interestingly, even though it is known that peach belongs to the rosid subclass of eudicotyledons, as does <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, while snapdragon (<italic>A. majus</italic>) falls in the asterids subclass, as does tomato, the peach genes are more similar to those of snapdragon and tomato than to those of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern313/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online for gene structures and proteins comparisons). The two peach C-type MADS box genes described here have a gene structure that is conserved in the single <italic>Arabidopsis AG</italic> gene and in the two snapdragon <italic>FAR</italic> and <italic>PLE</italic> genes, but differs substantially from that of the two <italic>SHP Arabidopsis</italic> genes. Recently, <italic>SHP1/SHP2</italic> and <italic>PLE</italic> as well as <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>FAR</italic> were shown to be orthologues, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Causier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Based on gene structure and protein similarity, peach <italic>MADS 462</italic> can reasonably be considered to be the peach gene orthologous to both <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>FAR</italic> and thus it might also be named <italic>PpAG</italic>, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> proposed. In contrast, <italic>MADS 794</italic> could be orthologous to either <italic>SHP</italic> or <italic>AG</italic>. Should the first hypothesis be true, <italic>SHP</italic> should have undergone a deep structural rearrangement while <italic>MADS 794</italic> would have retained its ancient <italic>AG</italic>-like gene structure. In contrast, should the second hypothesis be correct, <italic>MADS 794</italic> would correspond to the second <italic>AG</italic> gene that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Causier <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> have hypothesized as lost in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, therefore the peach gene should be named <italic>PpAG2</italic>. In this case, peach orthologues to <italic>SHP</italic> would be either not discovered yet or deleted from its genome. A similar situation (two <italic>AG</italic> genes and the apparent lack of <italic>SHP</italic>) has been described for poplar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leseberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), a tree of the rosid subclass. The correct orthology assignment will be clarified when the peach genome sequence becomes available, thus allowing the analysis of syntenic loci conservation, beside the comparison of gene structure and protein similarities. Meantime, the name <italic>PpPLE</italic> is proposed for the peach <italic>MADS 794</italic> gene.</p><p>Because of its high level of expression during the ripening of peach fruit, a construct for constitutive expression of <italic>PpPLE</italic> has been introduced in tomato. Tomato is an optimal model system for this study since it can be transformed and, like peach, it produces fleshy fruits, although peaches are drupes while tomatoes are berries. Nevertheless, the general ripening process is very similar, both of them being climacteric fruits.</p><p>The constitutive expression of the <italic>PpPLE</italic> in tomato caused a homeotic conversion of the flower first whorl organs into carpels, and the molecular data indicate that the resulting ectopic fruits also underwent normal ripening. The fact that constitutive expression of the <italic>PpPLE</italic> gene caused a homeotic conversion of the first whorl but not of the second whorl seems in agreement with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Causier <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> who found that ectopic expression of <italic>PLENA</italic> in <italic>Antirrhinum</italic> resulted in a conversion of sepals into carpels, while transformation of petals into male organs was less apparent.</p><p>As well as in flowers, the <italic>PpPLE</italic> gene is normally expressed in increasing amounts during ripening (i.e. stages S3II&#x02013;S4II) of the peach fruit mesocarp, thus suggesting that it might also play a role in the ripening process. In the transgenic tomatoes harbouring the peach PpPLE cDNA, the expression of genes related to softening appears particularly indicative of a faster and enhanced softening process, since all the genes showed either an anticipated or an increased expression in the mature green transgenic tomatoes compared with the controls. The precocious expression of the &#x003b2;-GAL and EXP genes is worth mentioning. &#x003b2;-GAL activity renders cell walls more porous to other cell wall-degrading enzymes due to the degradation of the pectin lateral branches. EXP has the ability to destabilize the cellulose&#x02013;hemicellulose network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosgrove, 2000</xref>), and it has been shown that tomatoes expressing an antisense transgene for EXP had reduced softening, while other clones overexpressing the same EXP cDNA yielded fruits with enhanced softening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brummell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Particularly interesting are the data relating to genes encoding transcription factors known to be involved in tomato fruit ripening. The <italic>LeMADS RIN</italic> gene has expression that is barely detectable in mature green fruits but shows a relevant increase during the ripening phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vrebalov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartley and Ishida, 2007</xref>). In the present conditions, the expression of <italic>RIN</italic> followed the same pattern in both cases, except for a difference in the mature green fruit where its expression was already measurable in transgenic, in contrast to wild-type, fruit.</p><p>The <italic>NOR</italic> gene has been cloned and patented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giovannoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) but, to our knowledge, its pattern of expression has only been published for tomato sepals grown <italic>in vitro</italic> and induced to become fleshy and red like the real berries. In that work it was shown that <italic>NOR</italic> expression was undetectable at the mature green stage, peaked at the orange stage, and had a slight decrease at the red stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartley and Ishida, 2007</xref>). In the present conditions <italic>NOR</italic> expression followed the same pattern except for an anticipated expression in the mature green transgenic berries.</p><p>The <italic>CNR</italic> gene is expressed throughout development and ripening of the tomato fruit, although the amount of transcript shows a sharp increase at the breaker stage and a subsequent decrease at lower levels in red fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manning <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In agreement with such a pattern, in the present experimental conditions <italic>CNR</italic> transcripts were present in both transgenic and control green fruits, but the amount of transcript measured in transgenic berries was &#x0223c;2-fold that in the controls. Also in the transgenic tomatoes the maximum transcript amount was observed at the breaker stage.</p><p>The general anticipated expression of all the analysed genes in the mature green transgenic berries might suggest that those fruit were actually less green, hence at a more advanced stage of maturation compared with wild-type fruit. Yet, the use of a <italic>CAB</italic> gene as a marker of the greenness state of the fruit demonstrated that the green transgenic berries had a higher amount of <italic>CAB</italic> transcripts, and could therefore be regarded as greener than those of the wild type. Interestingly, the amount of transcript of the <italic>CAB</italic> gene also showed a marked drop already in fruits at the breaker stage, thus confirming the faster ripening of the transgenic fruits.</p><p>The fact that so many different genes related to ripening showed an altered expression in transgenic fruits suggests that the genes responsible for such a change should be those for one (<italic>35S</italic>-<italic>PpPLE</italic>) or more (direct and indirect targets of <italic>35S</italic>-<italic>PpPLE</italic>) transcription factors. However, the fact that the ripening process was not particularly changed from a qualitative point of view suggests that <italic>PpPLE</italic> might actually have modified the activity of other endogenous &#x02018;factors&#x02019;. A likely candidate might be <italic>TAGL1</italic>, the tomato orthologue of <italic>PpPLE</italic>, whose expression was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busi <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>. They observed <italic>TAGL1</italic> expression in both flowers and fruits, although they only analysed fruits at early stages of development. In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hileman <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> showed that both <italic>TAG1</italic> and <italic>TAGL1</italic> transcripts could be recovered from tomato flowers and fruits, although an RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that <italic>TAGL1</italic> has a much higher level of expression than <italic>TAG1</italic> in both reproductive organs (i.e. stamens and carpels) and fruits, thus mimicking the situation observed in peach for the <italic>PpPLE</italic> and <italic>PpFAR</italic> genes, respectively. In the present experiments, <italic>TAGL1</italic> showed a comparable expression pattern in both transgenic and control fruits. The proteins encoded by <italic>TAGL1</italic> and <italic>PpPLE</italic> share a significant similarity (72%), therefore the peach protein might have the same activity as the endogenous TAGL1 protein, and this might cause a misregulation of the regulatory activity normally performed by <italic>TAGL1</italic>. Thus, the PpPLE and TAGL1 proteins might participate in the formation of the same complexes and/or compete for the same targets.</p><p>The investigation of the involvement of MADS-box genes in the development of reproductive structures has mostly dealt with their role in the formation of flowers and, to a lesser extent, with the patterning of dry fruits. In this work, it has been shown that a C-type MADS-box gene, besides its expected role in the formation of carpels, as evidenced by the homeotic conversion of sepals into carpels following its constitutive expression in tomato, is also recruited afterwards during the transformation of the carpel into a ripe fleshy fruit. This is not surprising if one considers that the overall development of a carpel represents a continuum that starts with its determination in the forming flower bud and ends with its transformation into a fruit. Therefore, a parsimonious use of the same regulatory genes, as exemplified here by the peach <italic>PLENA</italic>-like MADS-box gene, seems to be exploited by higher plants for the development of their reproductive structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern313/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern313/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.</bold> List of the oligonucleotides used in the qRT-PCR experiments.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern313/DC1">Table S2</ext-link></bold>.
