Pools of pistils representing early and late stages of ovule development were evaluated and data from the three genotypes were used to designate genes that were predominantly expressed in the integuments using pair-wise and cluster analyses.

Robust microarray averaging (RMA) analysis of array data provided the most reliable comparisons, especially for weakly expressed genes. The studies yielded an over-abundance of transcriptional regulators in the identified genes, and these form a set of candidate genes for evaluation of roles in ovule development using reverse genetics.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ovules, the precursors to seeds, are an important focus of study to better understand plant development within a unique reproductive context. Ovules are highly specialized for reproductive function, but the typical angiosperm ovule, as found in Arabidopsis, is relatively simple morphologically. Development of the ovule within the carpel is well described, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], beginning with primordia emergence from the marginal placentas of the carpels (floral stage 9, ovule stage 1). The primordia have three regions, the distal region or nucellus, marked by the formation of the large megaspore mother cell, the central or chalaza region indicated by the emergence of the two integuments, and the proximal region which forms the funiculus supporting the ovule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; floral stage 10, ovule early stage 2). The inner integument initiates as a ring from divisions in the L1, while the outer integument derives from divisions on the gynobasal side of the ovule below the inner integument. The integuments grow together to enclose the nucellus and when this has occurred the embryo sac develops from a meiotic product of the megasporocyte. The integuments continue to differentiate with the outer and inner integument cells changing in appearance in preparation for the integuments roles in pollen tube attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and formation of the seed coat.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Ovule phenotypes of wild type, <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant</italic></bold>.

Ovules are shown at developmental stage 2-IV (A, D, G), and 4-IV (B, E, H). (A, B) In wild type ovules, the two integuments grow as sheaths around the nucellus until it is fully enclosed and the outer integument envelopes the inner integument. (D, E) In contrast, <italic>ino </italic>mutant ovules show only inner integument growth and this structure encloses the nucellus but does not cause curvature of the ovule at maturity. (G, H) <italic>ant </italic>ovules do not initiate integuments but do elongate and form a swollen region at the chalaza. The <italic>ant </italic>nucellus is naked at maturity. (C, F, I) Ovules at anthesis were cleared and stained for callose accumulation to identify non-functional embryo sacs that can be seen as brightly fluorescing structures in <italic>ino </italic>mutants (arrow, F) and that are absent in wild type (C).

Mutants with altered integument morphogenesis such as <italic>bell1 </italic>(<italic>bel1</italic>) and <italic>inner no outer </italic>(<italic>ino</italic>) were discovered in screens for sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Systematic reverse genetics analysis of families of transcription factors has also yielded important ovule regulators, including the MADS domain proteins encoded by <italic>SHATTERPROOF </italic>(<italic>SHP</italic>)<italic>1/2 </italic>and <italic>SEEDSTICK (STK) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Finally, several genes identified through their action in other organs or processes were subsequently shown to have important effects in ovules, including <italic>WUSCHEL (WUS) </italic>and <italic>PHABULOSA (PHB) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Identification of such genes and analysis of their interactions have permitted the construction of models of ovule development, including specification of regional ovule identity, integument identity and outgrowth, and asymmetric growth of the outer integument, reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The two integuments are particularly interesting as a focus of study as their evolutionary origins are unclear and are likely to be separate, the inner integument from sterile branches or telomes, and the outer integument from lateral structures similar to leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Despite the recent advances, control of several aspects of ovule development, such as inner integument patterning and integument morphogenesis, remains poorly understood. Further mutant screens to uncover regulatory genes may have limited success as some phenotypes may not cause sterility, and pleiotropic effects that lead to loss of flowers would obscure ovule effects. A further problem results from redundancy between gene families or pathways, which has been shown for diverse Arabidopsis developmental regulators such as the <italic>SEPALLATA (SEP)</italic>/<italic>AGAMOUS (AG) </italic>clade of MADS domain genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the <italic>NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) </italic>family genes, <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDONS (CUC)1 </italic>and <italic>2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the <italic>KANADI (KAN) </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. An alternative to such forward genetic approaches is the expression-based discovery of integument-expressed genes. Research on the genes described above has shown that developmental regulators often have specific and restricted spatial and temporal domains of expression and this concept has been exploited in strategies to find such genes using subtractive hybridization, differential display, cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays, and technologies such as Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Microarrays have been successfully used to identify genes expressed in specific structures. Some studies have utilized isolated cell types or organs, such as guard cells or pollen for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In other studies, developmental mutants that have homeotic changes or loss of structures have been used through comparisons to wild type to identify genes expressed in those structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Two ovule mutants have phenotypic properties that would enable a microarray approach to integument gene identification. The <italic>ino-1 </italic>mutant has an almost complete loss of the outer integument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The <italic>INO </italic>gene encodes a YABBY domain protein important in polarity and growth of the outer integument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The <italic>AINTEGUMENTA </italic>(<italic>ANT</italic>) gene is known to be expressed in and required for proper outgrowth of organ primordia and, in particular, <italic>ant </italic>mutants fail to initiate integument primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Because these mutants lack integuments, any gene that is expressed mostly in these structures should be at a much lower abundance relative to wild type in the set of mRNAs isolated from these mutants. This approach would not be expected to identify only genes that are direct targets of <italic>INO </italic>and <italic>ANT</italic>, but rather a set of genes downstream of these that are expressed in the structures that are absent in the mutants.</p><p>We used microarrays to evaluate differences in gene expression between wild-type carpels and those of <italic>ino-1 </italic>and <italic>ant-4</italic>. Approximately nine hundred genes were identified that were predicted to be expressed in placenta or ovules, with two hundred twenty-two of these genes reliably predicted to be in the ovule primordia or integuments based on high fold changes or support from both mutants. Among these are genes that are known to have integument-specific activity, demonstrating that the approach can detect genes important for ovule function. The results were validated through quantitative polymerase chain reaction and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization for a subset of the genes. These results will help build a more detailed picture of the processes involved in integument morphogenesis, and, through further research on candidate genes, will yield a greater understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of ovule morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutants used for comparative expression profiling</title><p>The <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>mutants were chosen for array analysis due to their ovule phenotypes. Ovules of strong <italic>ino </italic>mutants have only an inner integument, and do not curve as in wildtype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The general role of the <italic>ANT </italic>gene in all above ground organs is to promote the formation and growth of primordia, and to regulate that growth to control the size of plant organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. For most organs these functions are partially redundant with other genes, but in <italic>ant </italic>mutants the integument primordia fail to initiate, and mature ovules have only a slightly enlarged chalaza between the funiculus and nucellus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G, H</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the integument phenotypes, both mutants are affected in formation of mature embryo sacs, leading to partial and complete sterility for <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>respectively. The viability of mature embryo sacs was estimated using decolorized aniline blue staining for callose, which accumulates in defective embryo sacs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, F, I</xref>). 13% of <italic>ino </italic>mutant embryo sacs (n = 100) did not show an accumulation of callose staining and approximately 5 seeds per silique (compared with 45&#x02013;50 for wild type) were formed under experimental growth conditions indicating that only approximately one in ten embryos sacs were functional. This is in agreement with microscopic analysis indicating that structurally normal embryo sacs could be formed in <italic>ino </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For the <italic>ant-4 </italic>allele, there are fewer ovules per carpel than in wild type, and sporogenesis was not observed to proceed beyond the megaspore mother cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] resulting in complete female sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, pistil size and stigma cell number were reduced, and carpels could be partially unfused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Expression Profiling</title><p>The pistil expression profiles of <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>were compared with each other and to wild type (Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic>, Ler), with the following predicted gene expression profiles. As the outer integument is missing in both mutants, genes that are preferentially expressed there should exhibit absent or significantly decreased expression in both <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>samples, relative to wild type. In contrast, an inner integument-expressed gene should exhibit absent or decreased expression in <italic>ant </italic>but would be unchanged in <italic>ino </italic>samples as the inner integument is still present. A gene that is expressed in both integuments is likely to show reduced expression in both mutants, with a greater reduction in <italic>ant </italic>samples as these lack both integuments. However, gene expression changes may be also caused by defective embryo sac formation in <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>and by the reduction in ovule number and effects on carpels in <italic>ant</italic>. By noting the expression level changes of genes that are known to be expressed in these areas it may be possible to define a pattern that identifies such genes for exclusion.</p><p>Three different developmental classes of pooled pistils were used. The FULL (F) pool, collected from wild type (WT) and <italic>ino</italic>, contained pistils from the stage at which ovule primordia are emerging (floral stage 9, ovule stage 1-II), up to mature ovules, just prior to anthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; floral stage 12, ovule stage 3-IV). Samples containing fewer stages were collected to decrease the complexity of the samples to provide better resolution of expression differences and to evaluate the temporal expression patterns of selected genes. The EARLY (E) pool, collected from all three genotypes, included the youngest stages described above up to the point when the integuments first enclose the nucellus (floral stage 11, ovule stage 3-I), while the LATE (L) pool, collected from WT, captured the remaining stages after the integuments enclose the nucellus up to anthesis. Three biological replicates of each sample were used, with the exception of the WT L arrays, which had two replicates.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Stages of ovule development collected in the pistil pools</bold>. Differential interference contrast images of wild-type ovules representing stages included in the pools. The FULL pools of pistils contained ovules from stage 1-II, through stage 3-IV ("maturity"). The EARLY pools of pistils contained ovules from stage 1-II through stage 3-I, when the integuments just cover the nucellus. The LATE pool included ovule stages 3-II to 3-IV during which here is little change in ovule shape. The genotypes that were collected for each pool are indicated in grey.

The data from these arrays were processed using Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], as well as with dchip and Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS) in order to determine which method would be most appropriate for the data analysis. Scatterplots between replicates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and correlation coefficients (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) showed that the replicates were very similar to each other (r = 0.9930 - 0.9979 for RMA) and that RMA produced the smallest variance between replicates, particularly at low levels of expression. Comparisons between genotypes were made with the RMA processed data using a moderated t-test in the <italic>limma </italic>program (<italic>affylmGUI</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], which stabilizes variances when few replicates are used, and has been used to analyze data in other plant microarray experiments with similar numbers of replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. A multiple testing adjustment of p-values was obtained by conversion to q-values, where a confidence level of 0.01 was used, giving a false discovery rate of 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The dchip processed data were also used for genotype comparisons using the modified fold change method, where the fold change threshold was 1.2, using the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for fold change. Using the two statistical tests, there were more genes identified as significantly changed between <italic>ant </italic>E and wildtype with the RMA-<italic>limma </italic>test than with the dchip test (3537 and 1672 respectively) and greater than 50% of these genes were uniquely identified by a single method (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The <italic>limma </italic>test with RMA processed data was successful at identifying seventeen genes known to be expressed in ovules while the dchip fold change method was not as successful (five of seventeen genes failed to be identified) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). This indicated that the RMA-<italic>limma </italic>method was more appropriate for the task of identifying ovule-expressed genes than the dchip method. Based on these results, RMA processed data were used for further expression analysis described below.</p><p>Pairwise comparisons between the mutant and the baseline wild type arrays (WT F and <italic>ino </italic>F, WT E and <italic>ino </italic>E, and WT E and <italic>ant </italic>E) showed that many more genes were changed in the <italic>ant </italic>E samples (up to 14 times the number identified with <italic>ino </italic>E) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), which was predictable from the more perturbed phenotype of <italic>ant </italic>mutants and the wider spectrum of action of the <italic>ANT </italic>gene. In addition, there were more genes identified in the <italic>ino </italic>F comparison than in the <italic>ino </italic>E comparison, which indicates that there are several identified genes expressed in later stages of ovule development. Finally, there were at least as many genes with increased expression in the EARLY mutant arrays as there were with decreased expression. This is in contrast to the <italic>ino </italic>F comparison, where more genes exhibited decreased expression in the mutant.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of genes significantly changed between mutants and wildtype</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Pairwise tests</bold></td><td align="left"><bold># of genes</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Subcategory</bold><sup>a</sup></td><td align="left"><bold># of genes</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">WT F vs <italic>ino </italic>F</td><td align="left"><bold>474</bold></td><td align="left">Up</td><td align="left">158</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">Down</td><td align="left">316</td></tr><tr><td align="left">WT E vs <italic>ino </italic>E</td><td align="left"><bold>243</bold></td><td align="left">Up</td><td align="left">120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">Down</td><td align="left">123</td></tr><tr><td align="left">WT E vs <italic>ant </italic>E</td><td align="left"><bold>3537</bold></td><td align="left">Up</td><td align="left">1820</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">Down</td><td align="left">1717</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The total number of significantly changed genes between the indicated genotypes are presented.

There was minor overlap with putative gametophyte expressed genes (83 of 1278) identified using mature <italic>nozzle/sporocyteless </italic>(<italic>nzz/spl</italic>) mutant ovules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and <italic>coatlique </italic>mutant gynoecia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, some genes expressed in specific cells of the embryo sac, such as <italic>WUSHCEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX </italic>2 (<italic>WOX2</italic>) and <italic>WOX8 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] or during meiosis (seven genes including homologs of <italic>SPO11 </italic>and <italic>RAD51</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], show no differential expression in our <italic>ant</italic>-hybridized arrays. A few genes were previously identified as expressed in stigmatic papillae and transmitting tract using arrays (seven of 140 identified) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, most of the differentiation that occurs in the stigma, transmitting tract and gametophyte was not captured by this experiment, leaving the loss of the integuments, reduction in ovule number and reduced growth of the medial regions as likely causes of the identification of the large number of genes with small changes in <italic>ant</italic>.</p><p>The interpretation of the cluster profiles for the 800 putative integument genes depended on whether the mutant expression was considered absent (which indicated the specificity of expression), the inclusion of known indicator genes for each cluster (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) and evaluation of expression levels in <italic>ino</italic>. At least six genes fall to very low levels in <italic>ant</italic>, and therefore could be integument specific, while two thirds of the genes appear to be expressed more highly during early stages of pistil development since the WT E level is higher than the WT L level.</p><p>SOM clusters 4, 5 and 8 &#x02013; 10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) contain a total of 310 genes that show little or no change between WT and <italic>ino </italic>arrays even at later stages and that have higher WT E than WT L levels (except cluster 10), indicating little or no outer integument or embryo sac expression later in development, and more expression early in development. Known genes in this group are expressed in medial regions, placenta and ovule primordia, for example <italic>CUC2, PERIANTHIA </italic>(<italic>PAN</italic>) and <italic>NUBBIN </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], while others also show some expression in integument primordia, such as <italic>BEL1</italic>, <italic>SPATULA </italic>(<italic>SPT</italic>) and <italic>PIN-FORMED 1 </italic>(<italic>PIN1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. For these genes, outer integument expression is too low to be discerned in the <italic>ino </italic>arrays relative to the overall expression levels in the pistil. The patterns can be roughly separated on the basis of fold change: expression in ovule primordia regions results in smaller changes (approximately -1.4) and ovule and integument expression results in slightly higher fold changes.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Groups of inner and outer integument expressed genes identified by SOM clustering and significant differences in expression</bold>. The expression profiles of genes that showed significant changes and were more than two-fold changed in the mutants are shown grouped by predicted location of expression and cluster. The mean values for each gene were standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (z-transformation), in order to focus on expression changes and not magnitude of expression. SOM cluster numbers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) are indicated at the bottom left of the graphs where applicable. (A) Genes likely to be expressed in the inner integument or other regions affected by the <italic>ant </italic>mutant are separated into 3 groups with different patterns. (B) Genes likely to be expressed in both integuments show a steady decrease in expression from WT E through <italic>ino </italic>E to <italic>ant </italic>E. (C) Genes likely to be expressed in the outer integument or at late stages in the embryo sac. The EARLY ("E") group is defined by lower expression levels in <italic>ino </italic>E, with similar levels in <italic>ant </italic>E while the FULL ("F") group contains those genes that only showed significant differences between WT F and <italic>ino </italic>F, and not at the early stages.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-9-29-3"/></fig><p>The remaining clusters all show changes in <italic>ino </italic>E arrays which were not considered statistically significant but do show a consistent pattern, and are split into two groups by their WT L and <italic>ino </italic>F expression levels, which are significantly lower than WT F levels in some cases. For clusters 0, 1, 2 and 6 the WT L expression is less than the WT E level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) indicating that gene expression does not rise or expand in later stages and the decrease in <italic>ino </italic>levels may indicate some expression in the outer integument. Accordingly, this group contains genes such as <italic>AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE 5 </italic>(<italic>AIL5</italic>) and <italic>ERECTA-LIKE 2 </italic>(<italic>ERL2</italic>), expressed in placenta, ovule and integument primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and L1 specific genes such as <italic>PROTODERMAL FACTOR 2 </italic>(<italic>PDF2</italic>) and <italic>MERISTEM LAYER 1 </italic>(<italic>ATML1</italic>) expressed in ovule primordia and the L1-derived integuments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. In addition, twenty seven embryo sac genes identified either by Yu <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or by Johnston <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] were found in this set of genes, which could also be a cause of decreased <italic>ino </italic>E levels. Cluster 2 also contains <italic>PHB</italic>, previously shown to be downregulated in <italic>ant </italic>gynoecia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], whose slight decrease in expression in the <italic>ino </italic>arrays could be reflecting post-transcriptional regulation of the mRNA in the outer integument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>].</p><p>The third group, clusters 3, 7 and 11, in which expression seems to increase towards later stages of pistil development, also shows decreases in the <italic>ino </italic>F arrays, with larger decreases in clusters 3 and 7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Such genes are likely to have early carpel or ovule expression as well as later outer integument expression, and remain expressed in later stages, as is seen with the cluster 3 gene, <italic>FIDDLEHEAD </italic>(<italic>FDH</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], and cluster 11 genes <italic>ERL1</italic>, which is expressed throughout early carpels and later resolves to expression in the ovules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], and <italic>PRETTY FEW SEEDS </italic>(<italic>PFS2</italic>), expressed in carpel and ovule primordia, and in the chalaza, integument primordia and nucellus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. These genes have more ovule specific expression and also show higher fold changes, which is likely to be correlated.</p><p>In summary, the known genes in this set of 800 genes encompass a wide variety of expression patterns, whose common thread seems to be expression in ovule primordia. On the basis of the clustering results, genes expressed primarily in the inner integument would be expected to have patterns similar those genes in clusters 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10. These groups are also likely to be populated with genes that have expression in placenta and ovule primordia. Any decrease in <italic>ino </italic>arrays appears to signify a wider expression pattern that includes ovule and integument primordia, and expression that is maintained later in development likely shows that the expression is not limited to primordial cells. With a few exceptions, more specific or prolonged ovule expression leads to higher fold changes between wild type and <italic>ant</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes putatively expressed in the outer integument</title><p>The fifty-eight genes that are decreased in both <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>to a similar level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) are considered good candidates for expression in the outer integument, and accordingly, the <italic>APETALA 3 </italic>(<italic>AP3</italic>) gene, known to be expressed in the outer integument, was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Similar to the genes described above, lower fold changes could imply general carpel expression combined with elevated or more specific outer integument expression, as seen with the <italic>SHP2 </italic>gene, also found in this group. <italic>SHP2 </italic>acts with related genes to specify ovule development, and is also expressed early in carpel development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>RABBIT EARS </italic>(<italic>RBE</italic>), produce a phenotype in which the growth of the outer integument is aberrant, with the inner integument being affected at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Expression of this gene has been described as being in both integuments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>], but this is not reflected by the measurements on the arrays, which show similar decreases in both <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>relative to wild type. There are at least three other uncharacterized transcription factor genes that would be good candidates for activity in the outer integument. These encode an AP2 domain protein, a ZF-HD protein and a myb domain protein.</p><p>Putative outer integument genes are also contributed by a comparison of the WT F and <italic>ino F </italic>arrays, with one hundred forty three genes identified only by these arrays. These are good candidates for being expressed in the later stages of outer integument development, and may be involved in differentiation of the cell layers in preparation for pollen reception or seed coat development. However, genes that are predominantly and strongly expressed in the embryo sac at late stages will share this pattern, as evidenced by the overlap (50 genes, 35%) with putative gametophyte expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore all the identified genes will require further validation of expression pattern. A total of seventeen putative outer integument genes dropped to very low levels in <italic>ino </italic>indicating specific expression in the outer integument.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes putatively expressed in both integuments</title><p>Twenty-five genes exhibited expression patterns expected for expression in both integuments, with <italic>ino </italic>expression lower than wild type and <italic>ant </italic>lower than <italic>ino </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Most such genes were greater than two-fold changed from wild type to <italic>ant</italic>, and all showed a reduction in <italic>ino </italic>F as well as in <italic>ino </italic>E, with variation in WT L levels. As expected, this group contains the <italic>INO </italic>gene, which is expressed briefly in the <italic>ino </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Also detected here is the <italic>SUPERMAN </italic>(<italic>SUP</italic>) gene, involved in regulation of <italic>INO </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>] and integument growth, although expression in integuments has not been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. For At4g12960, only inner integument expression has been described, at late stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but the array measurements predict expression in both the inner and outer integuments at earlier stages. For this gene and <italic>SUP </italic>it is possible that the loss of the outer integument affects gene expression in the inner integument.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary of analysis</title><p>While all the above genes are candidates for expression in the integuments, only those genes with significant expression changes from wild type in both <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant</italic>, or those with a 2-fold change level from wild type were examined closely (207 genes). This selection was made based on the observation that known expression patterns that were most specific to ovules had higher fold changes. This leaves 132 putative inner integument genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>), retaining known ovule expressed genes such as <italic>BEL1, PFS2, ETTIN </italic>(<italic>ETT</italic>), <italic>PAN </italic>and <italic>AIL5</italic>, but excluding genes with wider carpel expression (such as <italic>PHB </italic>and <italic>CUC2</italic>), L1 expressed genes, and other placenta and primordia genes such as <italic>FDH, MONOPTEROS, ATCEL2 </italic>and <italic>SPT</italic>. The outer integument group is reduced to 50 genes, removing genes such as <italic>SHP2 </italic>(FC = -1.3) whose expression is not specific to the outer integument, but retaining the <italic>AP3 </italic>and <italic>RBE </italic>genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). The 25 genes that show decreases in both <italic>ino </italic>and <italic>ant </italic>are all retained and listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>. The expression profiles of these genes from the arrays are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, grouped by general expression changes into 'outer integument', 'both integuments' and 'inner integument and primordia expression' groups, and then into subgroups based on analysis information above.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional categorization of the discovered genes</title><p>The sets of genes described above were analyzed for their putative functions, as listed at The Arabidopsis Information Resource <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.org"/>, using gene ontology searches <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org"/> and published literature. Divisions into broad functional classes are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The proportions of the different categories vary little between the putative expression groups. The most prominent categories are proteins with unknown function and proteins involved in metabolism. There are also many putative transcription factors and DNA binding proteins (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), which are good candidates for regulators of ovule development. The proportion of transcription factors is approximately 20%, which is higher than estimates for the proportion of transcription factors found in the genome (6&#x02013;7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr"

In confirmation of this prediction, early expression was seen in the placenta and ovule primordia, as well as the inflorescence meristem and flower primordia, and in the outer integument and distal funiculus of the ovule later. Serial sections indicated that expression was highest in the anlagen and primordia in the outermost 2 to 3 cell layers of flower primordia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Expression was observed in the floral organ primordia, and persisted in growing carpels, stamens and petals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The petal expression was highest in the edges of the petals, and expression in the anthers was highest in the center of each locule, prior to pollen formation. After microsporogenesis, expression in the tapetum and pollen decreased and was undetectable at maturity (not shown). In carpels, expression was limited very early to the parietal placental regions, before fusion of the septum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Expression remained high in the ovule primordia as they formed as protrusions from the placenta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D, E</xref>), and localized to the distal funiculus and outer integument after integument initiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>).

The grouping of genes into broad domains of expression had predictive power, as shown by the correct assignment of genes with know expression patterns and the results of <italic>in situ </italic>hybridizations performed on candidate genes. At least thirty uncharacterized genes encoding proteins with likely regulatory function were identified in this study as having preferential expression in integuments. Thus, the use of mutants that lack specific structures to identify gene expressed in those structures was successful in providing new candidates that are likely to be playing roles in integument growth and development.</p><p>The candidate genes were selected on the basis of a combination of robust statistical tests and biological information. Approximately 4000 differentially regulated genes were initially identified by pair-wise statistical tests, for which the FDR rate was kept at 1%, which implied that approximately 40 genes were incorrectly identified as significant. Subsequently, the sets of genes were subjected to biological tests, to ensure that their expression levels were logical, given the nature of the mutants: genes had to show a decrease in expression in the mutants, and, where necessary, in both mutants. Next, the genes were analyzed for shared patterns of expression and sorted into groups using known expression patterns as profile indicators. On the basis of these indicators and to bring the number of genes to a manageable level, the groups were further subjected to a filter whereby genes were only retained if they were greater than 2-fold changed or had significant q-values in two pair-wise comparisons, resulting in a set of 207 genes. The use of a fold-change cutoff was justified by the observation that more specific expression patterns had higher fold changes in this experimental context, helping to differentiate between broadly expressed genes and those with ovule-specific expression. In addition, genes with higher fold changes were more likely to be selected by different statistical tests, giving more confidence to their selection.</p><p>There was a small set of twenty-five genes (including six putative transcription factors) that were predicted to be expressed predominantly in both integuments, including the gene <italic>ATS/KAN4</italic>, now known to be expressed in both integuments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>]. Approximately ten-fold that number were predicted to be predominantly expressed in the outer integument (including at least ten putative transcription factors), and 50 of these genes were decreased by more than two fold in <italic>ino</italic>. Known outer integument genes were identified, such as <italic>AP3</italic>, and an unknown gene was shown to be expressed in the outer integument using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (At2g34700). Some genes, such as <italic>RBE </italic>and At4g12960, have described expression patterns that differ from the predicted expression from the array, with expression in both integuments instead of just one or the reverse. Taken together, these results show that the array analysis was successful at predicting overall expression in the integuments and for most genes can predict whether that expression is in the outer or both integuments. Several genes (132 with 2-fold decrease in <italic>ant </italic>or significant decrease in <italic>ino </italic>F) were identified as candidates for early inner integument expression. While the aim of this study was to uncover novel genes involved in integument development, the data have also shown a clear ability to identify those genes expressed in the placenta and ovule primordia, as shown by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization of the gene <italic>AGF2/</italic>At3g55560. This is a useful result as there is much that remains mysterious about placenta formation and the initiation of ovule primordia. Clustering of the different expression profiles suggests pattern differences between integument and placental expression, but further expression characterization will be necessary to sort such genes from those expressed in the inner integument.</p><p>Separately pooling early and late stages decreased the complexity of the samples and allowed better resolution of expression differences of lower expressed genes and genes active early in ovule development that may be key regulators of developmental processes. In addition, gene expression changes due to the failure of the embryo sac to develop were reduced with the earlier samples, as there were fewer putative gametophyte genes in the EARLY samples than the FULL samples. Although fifty of the 207 selected genes have evidence of embryo sac expression from other array experiments, there is a significant probability that such genes are not only expressed in the gametophyte, as genes such as <italic>PFS2, RBE</italic>, At2g34700 and At4g12960 have been shown to have specific integument expression, despite their identification as putative embryo sac genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. This work has also confirmed that the sensitivity of the arrays was sufficient to detect changes in integument expression even within the complex tissue of whole pistils. A similar ability to distinguish differentially expressed genes was observed in the comparison of whole siliques of wild type and heterozygous <italic>medea </italic>mutants that showed 50% embryo abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and by comparison of pistils with and without gametophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This sensitivity, however, was challenged when genes were expressed at lower levels or in very few cells, as seen with the meiosis and gametophyte cell specific genes, which are very likely not expressed in the <italic>ant </italic>mutant and yet show no difference between the mutant and wild type. This was partly beneficial, as these genes would contaminate the desired set of integument genes. However, if some genes were expressed very transiently in the integuments or in only a few cells, these genes would be unlikely to be found. The use of a relatively high fold change cutoff would also reduce the probably of finding such genes. Fortunately, genes expressed in integument primordia may not be affected as the primordia comprise several cells due to the ring or half ring nature of the integuments. Many of the identified genes were not at putatively absent levels in the mutants implying expression in other regions of the pistil. This is important because there is evidence that regulators of integument development have other roles in the carpel, as is the case for the <italic>SHP </italic>genes and <italic>ANT </italic>itself. However, the ability to detect different levels of expression was negatively affected when the expression was widespread, meaning that genes with more specific expression in integuments or primordia were preferentially identified.</p><p>There was an overabundance of transcription regulator genes in the dataset (20%) compared with the genome sequence (6&#x02013;7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. While there is some uncertainty in such analyses due to evolving notions of transcription regulation, transcription factors appear to be selectively identified in this analysis. One reason for this could be the nature of the comparison that was being made. Since a large part of the cell types making up the samples were in common between the genotypes, with only specific structures being absent, more ubiquitously expressed genes such as metabolic enzymes are less likely to have been identified. Rather, those genes that have more specific expression patterns were identified, and transcription factors are often among these types of genes. The forty-two putative transcription factors identified at high fold change in this experiment occur in several gene families. It was surprising that only one MADS domain protein was identified at greater than 2-fold changed, as these genes are significantly involved in reproductive development. For some specific genes, such as <italic>SHP2</italic>, this is may be because of their more general expression in the carpels.</p><p>Transcription profiles of gene family members can be compared to yield information on their possible redundant action, or to identify members that act alone in specific cell types. The four members of the HD-ZIP I family identified in this analysis display differences in expression profile, which will help to predict which genes to analyze in mutant combination. Similarly, <italic>NGA2 </italic>gene expression is decreased in <italic>ant </italic>by greater than 2-fold, which indicates that this family member is regulated differently from the remaining three <italic>NGA </italic>genes. <italic>NGA </italic>genes are thought to act redundantly in lateral organ growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>], and <italic>NGA2 </italic>could be acting more specifically in the carpel medial regions or inner integument.</p><p>The confirmation of expression using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization has provided useful information about two genes. The presence of the At2g34700 mRNA in the growing outer integument in a specific pattern, secretion of the At2g34700 protein into the cell wall, and the encoded extensin motifs suggest at least two possibilities for this gene. The protein may be acting in cell expansion or maturation, as the outermost cells of the outer integument are relatively large, and also undergo cell wall rearrangements after fertilization to accommodate secretion of mucilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>]. Extensins are also implicated in defense responses, and many respond to wounding or other environmental signals. An accumulation of this protein in the cell wall could be part of the complex set of defenses that are put in place to protect the developing seed. As putative knockouts in this gene did not show any unusual ovule morphology, double or triple mutants with paralogs may be needed to determine function.</p><p>The expression of the gene At3g55560 (<italic>AGF2</italic>) in carpels was specific to the placental regions and early ovule primordia, while the MPSS and GeneAtlas (Genevestigator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>] databases indicate that this gene is not limited to expression in the carpel, but is found in seedlings, leaves and roots, with strongest expression in callus. AGF2 contains an AT-hook motif thought to bind AT-rich regions of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>], and that has been implicated in plants in binding to matrix attachment regions of chromosomes during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>] as well as binding to promoters as part of HMG transcription complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>]. AGF1 and AGF2 bind to the <italic>GA3ox1 </italic>promoter in vitro, and AGF1 has been shown to function in the GA-negative feedback regulation of that gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>]. There is no additional evidence that AGF2 functions in GA signaling, but it is possible that this protein could be acting to control GA induced development in the placenta. One of three gibberellin receptors (GID1C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>] is also identified as putatively expressed in medial regions or ovule primordia indicating a possible specific action of a set of giberellin regulators in ovule development.</p><p>Several auxin responsive genes and genes involved auxin transport and perception were among the set of genes that were considered decreased in the mutants. These were genes such as <italic>PIN1</italic>, which had previously been shown to be expressed in the ovule epidermis and integuments in a polarized manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Such expression is thought to result in the observed foci of auxin accumulation in growing regions such as the integument tips. It therefore is not surprising that three of the auxin receptor proteins (<italic>TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 </italic>(<italic>TIR1</italic>), <italic>AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX 1 </italic>(<italic>AFB1</italic>) and (<italic>AFB3</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">118</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]) are predicted to be expressed in regions affected by <italic>ant</italic>. A pertinent question is whether there are specific auxin response factors (<italic>ARF</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">121</xref>] that act in ovule development. Only 2 <italic>ARF</italic>s were retained after applying the final fold change thresholds, including <italic>ETT </italic>and <italic>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 11 </italic>(<italic>ARF11</italic>). <italic>ETT </italic>has a known role in the auxin-mediated growth and development of the gynoecium, but no specific role has been demonstrated for <italic>ARF11 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>]. ARF18, the most similar protein to ARF11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>] (70% identity over most of the protein), shares a similar expression profile to the <italic>ARF11 </italic>gene but with lower fold changes that were significant but not sufficient to be included in the final set. This pair of genes could also be acting redundantly in ovules to mediate auxin responses and affect cell divisions and differentiation.</p><p>Our studies provide numerous candidate genes to serve as targets for further analysis for their specific expression patterns and function through reverse genetics. In addition, this dataset provides further utility as a resource for information on genes of interest identified through other means and also provides an as yet uncharacterized set of genes that were upregulated in the two mutants examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work identified a set of approximately two hundred candidate genes expressed in the integuments through comparison of wild type to mutant ovules. The genes are predicted to have expression in the outer integument, both integuments or the inner integument and ovule primordia, and these predictions were confirmed by the presence of known genes in these groups, and through in situ hybridizations. Different analysis methods were compared, and RMA was considered most effective at reducing variance for low expressing genes (such as transcription factors). Genes identified with the limma modified t-test differed by up to 50% from those identified by the dchip fold change test, but the limma test was more effective at identifying known genes that differ between genotypes and thus this test was used for the analysis. The results showed that it was possible to use a mutant, <italic>ant</italic>, with broad effects on plant phenotype to identify genes expressed specifically in ovules, when coupled with predictions from known gene expression patterns, or in combination with a more specific mutant, <italic>ino</italic>. Groups of genes known to act in plant growth regulator pathways (such as auxin and giberellin) were identified, confirming the importance of such pathways in organ patterning and growth and providing an indication of which family members are acting specifically in ovules. The studies yielded an over-abundance of transcriptional regulators in the identified genes, which form a set of candidate genes for evaluation with reverse genetics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material growth conditions</title><p>Wild type plants were Landsberg <italic>erecta </italic>(Ler) ecotype, and the <italic>ant-4 </italic>and <italic>ino-1 </italic>mutants were in the Ler background. Plants were grown in 24 hour light at 19&#x000b0;C in growth chambers, using a 1:1 mixture of Premier Pro-Mix 'BX' potting soil (Premier Horticulture, Oceanside, CA) and vermiculite. Once germinated, plants were fertilized using a complete nutrient solution once per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>]. All plants used in the array analysis were grown in a single growth chamber and flats of pots were rotated three times per week to different shelves and orientation to help ensure even growth conditions. Pots containing a particular genotype were placed randomly in flats. For each genotype and stage, pistils from more than 20 plants were collected over several days, during the same time period each day (10 AM &#x02013; 1 PM), and pooled. Pistils were collected into tubes on dry ice and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and array hybridization</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). aRNA synthesis was performed using the Ambion MessageAmp kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with biotin-11-CTP (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) and biotin-16-UTP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). aRNA was fragmented following Affymetrix protocol and total RNA, aRNA and fragmented aRNA were checked for fragmentation and purity by gel electrophoresis and absorbance. Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH 1 Genome Arrays (Cat # 900385; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). All arrays were processed by the Core Facility in the UC Davis Department of Medical Microbiology &#x00026; Immunology using an Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 640, the Affymetrix 450 Fluidics Station, and an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 Scanner. The array data sets were named for the genotype (WT, <italic>ino </italic>or <italic>ant</italic>), replicate number and ovule stage pool (E, F, L). All array hybridization data were deposited in the ArrayExpress database with accession number E-MEXP-1920.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Raw CEL data was generated using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix).

Raw CEL files were also loaded into dchip (v1.3 release date: 07/20/2005) and were normalized and modeled using the PM-MM and PM-only algorithms. Scatter plots of the log<sub>2 </sub>expression measures between a set of replicates processed with different methods and Pearson correlation coefficients were prepared using Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</p><p>For the statistical tests, <italic>affylmGUI </italic>was used to compute the moderated t-statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and the log fold changes. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Storey q-value method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. For dchip, the PM-only expression values of sets of replicates were used to compare with other genotypes using the 'compare samples' function, with the following criteria: means separated by at least 20 and a fold change of 1.2 (using the lower bound of 90% confidence interval). SOM cluster analysis was carried out in GeneCluster 2.1.7 (Broad Institute), chosen as the number of likely patterns was low and it was not important to identify sub-clusters.

This formed a sequence verified expression cassette using the 35S promoter driving expression of a chimeric gene that encodes a C-terminal fusion of the GFP protein to the At2g34700 protein. This plasmid was tested for transient expression by blasting into onion cells as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>].
