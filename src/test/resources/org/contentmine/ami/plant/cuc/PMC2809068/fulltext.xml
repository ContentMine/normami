Eukaryotic sRNAs are approximately 21-24-nucleotides molecules involved in many different cell processes, including development, heterochromatin formation, genome rearrangement, hormone signalling and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. There are different classes of sRNAs: short interfering RNAs, trans-acting RNAs and microRNAs (miRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] amongst others.</p><p>miRs are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression in plants and animals by promoting cleavage or translation inhibition of mRNAs coded by specific target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The stem-loop region of a long primary nuclear transcript (called miR precursor or pre-miR) is processed into 21-nucleotide RNAs by a multistep process involving the activity of DCL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], HEN1 and HYL1 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. AGO1 is the most important Argonaute protein in the plant miR pathway and preferentially binds small RNAs with a 5' terminal uridine such as most miRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. miRs are involved in plant development, signal transduction, transcription factor accumulation, protein degradation, response to environmental stresses and pathogen invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. miRs are expressed at variable levels in diverse tissues and developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], regulate their own biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and it has been reported that modest changes in miR level can result in substantial changes in the accumulation of mRNAs target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These facts evidence that miR expression is under a tight and fine regulation.</p><p>Over-expression of miR genes or viral proteins, such as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) suppressors, cause multiple developmental defects by interfering with miR-guided target cleavage/degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Viral infections also cause miR alteration and development abnormalities or symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, it is not totally clear how viral infections interfere with miR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and which are the consequences of such interference. In <italic>Brassica sp</italic>. for example, it has been reported that <italic>Turnip mosaic virus </italic>infection specifically induced the accumulation of miR1885 that targets a TIR-NBS-LRR class disease-resistant transcripts for cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These data clearly suggest an important role of miRs in host-pathogen interactions. Basically, miR pathways could be affected at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, the latter involving miRs processing, accumulation and activity. Most of the articles reporting miR alteration upon viral infection or transgenic expression of viral proteins uncovered post-transcriptional regulation involving the silencing suppressors activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Nonetheless it was also shown that expression of viral proteins with non-PTGS suppressor activity can also alter miRs accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge there are so far no reports of the alteration of miRs transcription upon plant viral infections.</p><p>In this work, we analyzed whether the transcriptional regulation of a miR promoter was altered by a plant virus infection. We selected miR164 since its accumulation is increased after <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus </italic>(TMV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], it is involved in plant development and its mRNA targets are well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. miR164 is potentially transcribed from three independent loci, miR164a, miR164b and miR164c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and negatively regulates transcription factors with NAC domains such as CUC1 and CUC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These factors are redundantly involved in the initiation of the shoot apical meristem and in the establishment of cotyledon and floral organ boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Recently, it was also shown that miR164 participate in a trifurcate feed-forward pathway involved in cell death in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Here, we cloned the putative <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>miR164a promoter (P-miR164a), obtained <italic>A. thaliana </italic>transgenic lines expressing the <italic>uidA </italic>reporter gene (GUS) under its regulation, and studied its spatial and temporal expression. Finally, we analyzed the P-miR164a activity and the mature miR164, pre-miR164a and CUCs mRNAs accumulation after viral infections and hormone treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bioinformatic analysis and cloning of the putative promoter sequence of the MIR164a gene</title><p>In order to characterize and define the proper miR164a gene promoter sequence and its regulatory elements, we performed an <italic>in silico </italic>analysis of the approximately 2.5 Kbp region located upstream of the mature miR164a sequence. A previous report showed that a 2.1 Kbp fragment upstream of miR164a is able to rescue null miR164 mutant lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

A 2522 bp fragment (-2483 to +39, considering as +1 the transcription start site) was PCR amplified, cloned and completely sequenced to verify its identity and will be referred from now on as the miR164a promoter (P-miR164a).

To study the activity of P-miR164a during plant development, a time course assay was performed.

To study whether virus infection could also interfere with miR pathways at the transcriptional level, we quantified P-miR164a-derived GUS activity after viral infection. We independently inoculated (or mock-inoculated) two P-miR164a::GUS lines showing low (line L35) and high (line L56) GUS expression level to consider the influence of the genomic context of the T-DNA insertion, 35S::GUS and EV::GUS plants with <italic>Oilseed rape mosaic virus </italic>(ORMV) and TMV-Cg.

In the experimental conditions, both tobamoviruses infected a high percentage of plants (above 95%) and accumulated to high titers (data not shown). First, the tissue localization pattern of GUS activity after viral infections was compared through histochemical staining assays and no clear alterations were detected upon infections (data not shown). Next, GUS activity was measured using a total rosette protein extract to minimize the characteristic patchy tissue distribution effect of areas with different infection levels.

Some of these events may be required for the proper virus replication and spread, some may be plant responses and others may be just a side effect of virus infection. In turn, some of these alterations might be responsible for virus symptoms. Different molecules emerged as candidates to modulate this complex interaction, and a group of them are miRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Accordingly, miRs accumulation and activity were shown to be altered by virus infection and/or by the transgenic expression of viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Different hypotheses, all of them involving post-transcriptional regulation, have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Furthermore, this process may occur in the cytoplasm, after miR nuclear processing by DCL1 and subsequent nucleo-cytoplasmic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>In this work we showed for the first time that virus infections and GA3 treatment lead to enhanced transcriptional activity of P-miR164a thus revealing a novel mode of viral interference with plant miR biogenesis.</p><p>At early stages of leaf development, we showed that P-miR164a has a spatial expression pattern similar to the one reported by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Next, we further expanded the characterization to fully developed organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). One interesting observation was the identification of the highest P-mR164a activity on the vascular tissue of plants at stages 1.12 to 5.1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This time point correspond, according to Boyes et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] just after the switch of the vegetative to the reproductive growth, and when several processes are initiated, including changes in hormone levels. This switch is also relevant for plant-virus interactions since it coincides with the time point when virus replication is transiently arrested, as reported by Lunello et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We also detected a strong reduction in P-miR164a activity at plant developmental stage 8.0 that correlated with a reported decrease in mature miR164 levels and an increase of its target gene <italic>oresara-1 </italic>(means "long-living" in Korean) mRNA (ORE-1), which positively regulates aging-induced cell death in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Upon ORMV infection, P-miR164a::GUS transgenic lines (L35 and L56) accumulated higher levels of GUS, showing that virus infection could directly or indirectly interfere with miR164a regulation at the transcriptional level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Supporting these results, pre-miR164a accumulation also increased after viral infection in the same set of lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Nevertheless, the increased pre-miR164a accumulation could be as well explained by a change in the nuclear precursor rate processing. This possibility is unlikely in view of our GUS activity results although a partial contribution cannot be ruled out (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>). Furthermore, the ORMV infection elevated approximately by six fold the expression of the endogenous pre-miR164a compared to the mock-inoculated plants in wild type Col 0 plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) also indicating that the transcriptional induction of P-miR164a is not affected by a genomic positional effect in the transgenic plants nor an artifact of the transgenic lines (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B, C</xref>). In sum, our results showed that miRs promoter activation should be considered to explain changes in miRs abundance during virus infection. Along this line, Csorva et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] demonstrated that tobamovirus infection increases miRs accumulation in <italic>hst-15 </italic>mutant plants (in which miR nuclear export is compromised) as well as in wild type plants. In this case, the increase in miR accumulation may be due to a transcriptional induction rather than a post-transcriptional regulation, given the fact that the PTGS suppressor and miRs are located in different cell compartments. Moreover this data is similar to the increase of miR transcription in response to different abiotic stresses reported by Liu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, our results show that the most severe tobamovirus, ORMV, significantly altered P-miR164a activity (in all lines evaluated) and produced a major increase in miR164 and in its target CUC1 mRNA accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The fact that CUC1 (and not CUC2) was altered upon infection is in agreement with the observed degree of alteration of both target mRNAs in triple <italic>miR164abc </italic>mutant lines, since in rosette leaves CUC1 was the more responsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, infection by a less severe virus such as TMV-Cg raised to a lesser extent (or did not change) P-miR164a activity and mature miR164 and CUC1 mRNA accumulation. These results evidence a correlation between infection severity and miRs pathways alteration. This agrees with a correlation recently reported between the increased accumulation of a set of selected miRs and symptom severity of tobacco plants separately infected with six different tobamoviruses (Bazzini et al, submitted) and, all together, this data may suggests a role of miRs alteration on symptom severity. Similar results were obtained in <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic>/tomato interactions by Cillo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>Even when we showed that virus infection elevates P-miR164a activity and increases pre-miR164a and mature miR164 accumulation, we detected higher levels of CUC1 mRNA target in rosettes leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This reduction in miR activity is in agreement with reported data and was mostly explained by the action of viral PTGS suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>Tobamovirus </italic>PTGS suppressors (p126k for TMV) mostly act by inhibiting the assembly of the RISC complex, although they cannot affect already sRNA-loaded RISC complexes as other stronger suppressors do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Besides, their mode of action involves at least two functions: interference with sRNAs methylation and sRNAs binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This binding and sequestration of sRNAs as double-strand inactive forms is a common strategy of viral PTGS suppressors that might allow the stabilization and thus the increase of sRNAs accumulation and at same time reducing the miR activity level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>As it was mentioned before, phytohormones accumulation change after virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and putative phytohormone-responsive elements were detected in the P-miR164a sequence by <italic>in silico </italic>analysis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Consequently, hormones could be one of the candidate molecules mediating the linkage between viral infection and P-miR164a induction. In agreement, our data indicated that GA3 treatment induced P-miR164a promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Additionally, Guo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reported that NAA treatment produces a modest induction of miR164 and a reduction of NAC1 target mRNA in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>roots. Accordingly, it is reasonable to propose that miR promoter activity could be altered after viral infection by changes in phytohormones levels. Furthermore, several of the miRs whose accumulation are modified by tobamovirus infection were shown to be directly or indirectly related to phytohormone regulation (miR160 targeting ARF per example) or directly regulated by hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Therefore, it makes sense to propose a crosstalk between hormone and miRs abundance alterations (or vice versa) after virus infection. In fact, recent work by Navarro et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] reported a link between miRs, hormones and pathogen resistance.</p><p>The mechanism of P-miR164 induction by virus infection and its implications are still unknown. The alteration of P-miR164 activity upon infection implies that virus infections mediate a nuclear modification but, as there are no reports of tobamovirus encoded proteins with nuclear activity, this could be the result of an indirect effect. Similarly, it is known that TMV infection causes a change in the nuclear localization of a putative regulator of auxin response involved in plant development that in turn alters auxin-mediated gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. We cannot rule out the existence of a feedback regulation of P-miR164a activity mediated by CUC1 target mRNA abundance. As previously mentioned, viral infection could decrease miR activity by its PTGS suppressors, increasing the miR-targets level. Consequently, P-miR164a might be induced to produce more miR to restore target accumulation. However, since the observed outcome was a higher level of miR-target after infection this suggests that PTGS suppressor action was stronger (reducing miR activity) than the resulting outcome of P-miR elevation of the transcription level at the time point analyzed. Additional evidence is needed to address this point. Although the biological role of P-miR164a induction during virus infection is still unknown, the transcription component described here must be taken into account when exploring the miR role in host-pathogen interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our work showed for the first time that, in addition the already described post-transcriptional effects, virus infection can interfere with miRs pathways at a transcriptional level.
