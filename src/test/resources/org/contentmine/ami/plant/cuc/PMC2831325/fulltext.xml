Translation of this RNA is initiated by standard cap dependant mechanism or by internal entry of the ribosome. Two regions of the genomic RNA are able to attract initiation complexes, the 5&#x02032; untranslated region and the <italic>gag</italic> coding region itself. Relying on probing data and a phylogenetic study, we have modelled the secondary structure of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV<sub>Mac</sub> coding region. This approach brings to light conserved secondary-structure elements that were shown by mutations to be required for internal entry of the ribosome. No structural homologies with other described viral or cellular IRES can be identified and lentiviral IRESes show many peculiar properties. Most notably, the IRES present in HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region is endowed with the unique ability to recruit up to three initiation complexes on a single RNA molecule. The structural and functional properties of <italic>gag</italic> coding sequence define a new type of IRES. Although its precise role is unknown, the conservation of the IRES among fast evolving lentiviruses suggests an important physiological role.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Primate lentivirus genomic RNA (gRNA) plays a dual role as an mRNA template to produce the Gag and the Gag-Pol polyproteins, and as a genome encapsidated into virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Whether those two functions are mutually exclusive or if instead one requires the other depends on the virus considered. HIV-1 gRNA can fulfil both functions interchangeably and independently, while HIV-2 gRNA needs to be translated to be encapsidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The Gag polyprotein thus produced is matured by the viral protease in four main proteins known as the matrix, the capsid, the nucleocapsid and p6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Genomic RNAs, which are RNA polymerase II transcripts, are capped and could theoretically be translated following a cap dependent mechanism. However, the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (leader or 5&#x02032;UTR) of lentivirus gRNA contains numerous conserved <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements required at various stages of the virus cycle. Those elements are conserved sequences and stable stem-loops involved in many phenomena, including transcription regulation, reverse transcription, encapsidation, non-covalent dimerisation, or splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">5&#x02013;9</xref>). Most of them are, at one stage or another, the site of RNA or protein interactions. Such characteristics are clearly detrimental for translation by a cap dependant mechanism since stable structures impede ribosome scanning through the 5&#x02032;UTR to the initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Those long 5&#x02032;UTRs do not contain any AUG triplet, but numerous alternative initiation codons such as CUG, UUG or GUG. For example, HIV-1 and HIV-2 5&#x02032;UTR conceal, respectively, 17 and 36 such triplets, among which three for HIV-1 and 11 for HIV-2 lie in a favourable &#x02018;Kozak&#x02019; context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Albeit with a lower efficiency than the canonical AUG, such triplets can be recognised by the scanning complex and inhibit translation at the downstream <italic>bona fide</italic> initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Despite the unfavourable characteristics presented by the 5&#x02032;UTR, cap dependent translation of HIV-1 gRNA has been shown <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>), but seems less likely in the case of HIV-2 and SIV<sub>MAC</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Detailed investigations showed that initiation of Gag polyprotein translation could also be mediated by an Internal Ribosome Entry Site concealed in the 5&#x02032;UTR of HIV-1 and SIV<sub>MAC</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). Interestingly enough, HIV-1 IRES is especially active during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, when canonical cap dependent translation is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). No IRES activity has been detected to date in HIV-2 gRNA 5&#x02032;UTR. However, we previously reported that the HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region is endowed with an IRES activity that can recruit ribosomes on three in frame AUG, yielding three isoforms of the Gag polyprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The presence of an IRES within <italic>gag</italic> coding region, also demonstrated for HIV-1 and SIV<sub>Mac</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), confers to HIV-2 gRNA the potential to be efficiently translated as a leaderless RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Here we show that this property is conserved among primate lentiviruses. Using a combination of chemical/enzymatic probing and a phylogenetic analysis, we show that the <italic>gag</italic> open reading frame of the three viruses adopts a stable secondary structure. Mutations that destabilise conserved structural elements severely inhibit the IRES mediated translation, while the activity is retrieved with compensatory mutations that restore the pairing. Our results strongly suggest that the structure model is involved in recruiting the initiation complexes. Conservation of the IRES and its structure in such fast evolving viruses betrays the physiological importance of the observed phenomenon. Finally, we show that this HIV-2 IRES has the unique ability to attract up to three initiation complexes on a single RNA molecule. This work defines a new type of IRES, and paves the way to the molecular characterisation of IRESes present within the <italic>gag</italic> coding region of primate lentivirus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Constructions</title><p>RNAs were directly transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase from PCR products containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). For the translation of full length Gag, the DNA sequence corresponding to the coding region of <italic>gag</italic> HIV-2 (pROD10), <italic>gag</italic> HIV-1 (pNL4.3) or <italic>gag</italic> SIVmac (mac251, 13 001) were amplified by PCR using a 3&#x02032; oligonucleotide starting at the stop codon of HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic>, HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> or the SIV<italic>gag</italic> gene, and a 5&#x02032; oligonucleotide starting with the T7 promoter sequence and the 24 first nucleotides of the 5&#x02032;UTR of each gene, or the 24 first nucleotides of <italic>gag</italic> open reading frame, to generate 5&#x02032;UTR or AUG<sub>1</sub> constructs, respectively.

<italic>gag</italic> coding regions contain one or several IRES able to trigger translation from the first initiation codon, and from in frame AUG triplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We furthermore demonstrated that the HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region lacking the 5&#x02032;UTR is efficiently translated, with no obvious leaky scanning from the first to the second AUG triplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). To extend this property to other primate lentiviruses, we compared the translation efficiency of leaderless (HIV-1&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub> and SIV<sub>MAC</sub>&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub>) or 5&#x02032;UTR containing HIV-1 and SIV<sub>Mac</sub>
<italic>gag</italic> gene (HIV-1-5&#x02032;UTR and SIV-5&#x02032;UTR) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As previously observed, the translation of both types of constructs yield several isoforms for each virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The translation of HIV-2 rod genomic RNA yields three isoforms of 57, 50 and 44 kDa which are initiated from three in frame AUGs present within the matrix portion of the <italic>gag</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). SIV<sub>MAC</sub> genomic RNA translation mainly yields two isoforms: the full length 55 kDa polyprotein and 43 kDa protein initiated from the in frame AUG<sub>888&#x02013;890</sub> homologous to HIV-2 third initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We have detected an additional 52 kDa minor isoform, the translation of which is probably initiated from AUG<sub>621&#x02013;623</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Translation of HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA yields the previously described 55 and 40 kDa proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Of note, the shortest HIV-1 isoform is not homologous to any of HIV-2 or SIV<sub>Mac</sub> isoforms, because it is initiated on AUG<sub>759&#x02013;761</sub>, within the capsid part of the polyprotein. In all three cases, translation of the leaderless open reading frame is clearly more efficient than when it is preceded by its cognate 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> in different context, was compared to a chimeric control gene constituted of the human &#x003b2; globin 5&#x02032;UTR followed by a portion of the &#x003b2; gal coding sequence. This control was engineered to contain the same number of methionine than the full length Gag, in order to facilitate translation efficiency comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Under the conditions we used, the translation of the leaderless HIV-2 gag mRNA is 25-fold more efficient than when preceeded by a 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). This is in clear contrast with the translation of an uncapped control gene which translation is 7-fold reduced upon 5&#x02032;UTR deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). In order to simplify the constructs nomenclature, the three initiation codons: AUG<sub>545&#x02013;547</sub>, AUG<sub>743&#x02013;745</sub> and AUG<sub>898&#x02013;890</sub> (numbering from + 1, the transcription start) are termed AUG<sub>1</sub>, AUG<sub>2</sub> and AUG<sub>3</sub>, respectively.

Those controls have been designed so that the protein translated contains the same number of methionines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) as the full length HIV-2 gag.

However, it is not clear if, in a leaderless context, the 5&#x02032; terminus of the RNA threads through the 40S subunit canal, or if the ribosomes are internally recruited. To preclude 5&#x02032; entry of the ribosomes, a stable hairpin (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;21.3 kCal) was added 15 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of HIV-2&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The presence of a 5&#x02032; stem-loop strongly reduced the translation of a control gene containing the globin 5&#x02032;UTR, and almost abolishes the translation of the cognate leaderless RNA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>)].

This indicates that initiation complexes, including those translating from AUG<sub>1</sub>, were recruited by an internal initiation event. However, we can not tell if the ribosomes translating from AUG<sub>2</sub> and AUG<sub>3</sub> were positioned by a direct internal initiation event or through a &#x02018;land and scan&#x02019; process.</p><p>As the sequences beyond AUG<sub>3</sub> do not influence translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we constructed a truncated form of the <italic>gag</italic> gene which ends by an artificial stop codon at position 1351 (807 nucleotides downstream to AUG<sub>1</sub>), this construct is termed HIV-2&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>. The apparent molecular weight of the three isoforms translated from this construct are 30, 23 and 17 kDa instead of 57, 50 and 44 kDa from the full length construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The improved resolution allowed us to detect a minor fourth isoform running at 25 kDa. This protein had been previously observed, with the full length construct, and termed p52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). It has been attributed to an alternative initiation event on a cryptic CUG and/or UUG codon at position 692&#x02013;694 and 695&#x02013;697, respectively. We confirmed the identity of this protein, by mutating both alternative initiation codons into non-initiation codons UUC<sub>692&#x02013;694</sub> and UCG<sub>695&#x02013;697</sub> (HIV-2&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>-alt). Translation of this mutant in RRL does no longer yield the 25 kDa protein while the three other isoforms remain efficiently produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Interestingly, initiation at AUG<sub>2</sub> is stimulated in HIV-2&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>-alt, this could reveal that initiation on CUG<sub>692</sub>/UUG<sub>695</sub> may originate from initiation complexes scanning to AUG<sub>2</sub>.

Ribosomal complexes (48S and 80S) were unambiguously identified by (i) comparison with the profile obtained with a control gene, (ii) modification of the profiles depending on the inhibitor used and (iii) analysis of the UV profile of the same gradients which detects 40S and 60S subunits.</p><p>HIV-2-AUG<sub>1</sub> RNA was incubated in GMP-PNP pretreated RRL. GMP-PNP, a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP, inhibits hydrolysis of GTP by eIF2 upon AUG recognition by the 48S particle. This prevents 60S subunit joining and causes 48S complexes accumulation on mRNA. After separation of the initiation complexes, most of the RNA sediments as hnRNP (fraction 5&#x02013;9), and as a peak corresponding to the 48S (fraction 14&#x02013;16). The 48S peak is shouldered (fraction 18) and smears until fraction 22, suggesting the presence of heavier complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). This experiment was repeated on a lysate pre-treated with cycloheximide, a translocation inhibitor which stalls ribosomes and induces the accumulation of 80S complexes on initiation codons. Under those conditions, the 48S peak in fraction 15 almost disappears, mostly to the benefit of a heavier complex in fraction 20 corresponding to the 80S complex. A significant amount of the mRNA sediments as a second peak centred on fraction 24, which is shouldered by a third peak reaching a maximum at fraction 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We then incubated a capped and poly-adenylated globin mRNA in untreated RRL, freeze translation by adding cycloheximide, and analysed the sedimentation profile of polysomes paused on the mRNA. We found that the first 80S complex sediments in fraction 20, while the two following complexes corresponding to two and three 80S ribosomes translating on the same RNA sediment in fraction 24 and 26, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). To confirm that the observed complexes were specific for HIV-2 coding region, we next analysed the sedimentation profile of 172-nucleotide long RNA transcribed from a human genomic sequence that do not contain any initiation triplet (Sequence available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S2</ext-link>). As expected, such an RNA yields only one peak (fraction 5) corresponding to the RNA complexed to non specific protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In order to determine if the formation of those initiation complexes relies on the initiations codons, we mutated both AUG<sub>2</sub> and AUG<sub>3</sub> to non-initiation codons (HIV-2&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;CUC<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;CUC<sub>3</sub>). Incubated in a cycloheximide pre-treated RRL this leaderless RNA sediments as a single peak corresponding to one 80S complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Furthermore, the exact same pattern of sedimentation with no decrease in intensity of the 80S peak is obtained when using a leaderless RNA preceded by a stable stem-loop (SL&#x02013;HIV-2&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;CUC<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;CUC<sub>3,</sub>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D) confirming the internal recruitment on AUG<sub>1</sub>. In summary, we show here that three 80S complexes are stalled on the WT <italic>gag</italic> sequence in cycloheximide pretreated RRL, while only one is observed upon mutation of the two internal AUG codons. Although there is no natural control for this, it is tempting to interpret the three lighter complexes observed in GMP&#x02013;PNP pre-treated lysate as multiple 48S complexes.

To this end, RNAs were incubated in a GMP&#x02013;PNP or cycloheximide treated RRL to pause initiation complexes. The presence and the position of the initiation complex were then revealed by reverse transcription using radiolabeled primers. Depending on the experimental system several premature reverse transcriptase stops 13&#x02013;21 nucleotides downstream to the A of the initiation codon are expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29 B30 B31">27&#x02013;31</xref>). We detected clear cycloheximide dependent reverse transcriptase stops downstream to each of the AUG triplets on the leaderless RNA. For the two internal initiation codons, we observed one stop at G<sub>761</sub>, 18 nucleotides downstream to AUG<sub>2</sub>, and four stops at G<sub>912</sub>A<sub>913</sub>C<sub>914</sub>C<sub>915</sub> located 17&#x02013;20 nucleotides 3&#x02032; of AUG<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C). Initiation on AUG<sub>1</sub> is clearly more enigmatic since it has previously been shown that the initiation complex contacts several nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon, and covers &#x0223c;15 nucleotides up- and downstream the initiation triplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We therefore compared the position of the initiation codon paused on AUG<sub>1</sub> on WT and leaderless RNA. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, the results obtained were similar on both RNA. The presence of the initiation complex induces five reverse transcriptase stops at C<sub>562</sub>G<sub>563</sub>U<sub>564</sub>C<sub>565</sub>U<sub>566</sub>, 17&#x02013;21 nucleotides downstream to AUG<sub>1</sub>. The specificity of those signals is demonstrated by their dependence on an intact initiation triplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;9).

<italic>gag</italic> coding region</title><p>The properties of some viral IRES rely on the integrity of their tertiary folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Based on chemical and enzymatic probing, we previously proposed a secondary structure model for the HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In this study, we modelled HIV-1 (laboratory strain NL4.3) and SIV<sub>MAC</sub> (isolate Mm251) <italic>gag</italic> coding region, according to experimental and phylogenetic data. Leaderless HIV-1&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub> and SIV<sub>MAC</sub>&#x02013;AUG<sub>1</sub> RNA were subjected to the action of CMCT, DMS or to the cleavage by the Cobra Venom RNAseV1 (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). DMS and CMCT specifically modify unpaired adenosine and cytosine or uracil and guanosine, respectively. RNAse V1 provides a complementary information since it specifically cleaves stacked nucleotides, revealing mostly double-stranded region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The nucleotides targeted by those reagents are revealed by reverse transcription initiated with a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled primer (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S3</ext-link> for examples of results). DMS and CMCT treatments were performed in presence or absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the reaction buffer, in order to gain insight into the influence of divalent ions on the folding. It is generally considered that Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions stabilise weak pairings and are required for the formation of long distance base pairings and pseudoknot. According to the intensity of the RT stop induced we ranked the hits in two classes: the weak hits (2&#x02013;3-fold increased compared to the untreated control RNA) and strong hits (over 3-fold). Conducting those processes in parallel, we obtained an extensive map of nucleotide accessibility that was used as constraints for Mfold. In a first round of modelling, we used only strong single-strand hits persisting in presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, the models were further refined using weak hits, RNAse V1 cleavage sites and a phylogenetic study (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S4, S5 and S6</ext-link>). For that matter, it should be noted that a multitude of sequences are available for HIV-1, we chose a subset of sequences representative of each groups and subtypes, plus one sequence from its homologue infecting the chimpanzee (SIVcpz). For SIV, we modelled the sequence of SIV<sub>Mac</sub> (macaque isolate Mm251) and compare it with 15 SIV sequences infecting different subspecies of macaque (SIV<sub>Mac</sub>, SIV<sub>MNE</sub> and SIV<sub>STM</sub>) and sooty mongabey monkeys (SIV<sub>SMN</sub>). A secondary structure model previously established for HIV-2 rod was assessed using 18 HIV-2 sequences available from the Los Alamos HIV database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index</ext-link>) and compared with the HIV-1 and SIV models. Please note that HIV-2 model was only slightly rearranged (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section), although it may deceptively appear very different from our previously published model due to changes in nomenclature and design. <italic>Gag</italic> sequences are clearly constrained by their coding function, leaving few opportunities for compensatory changes. Nevertheless we observed frequent conservative changes (transition on one side of the helix that does not disturb the pairing, as U&#x02013;G to C&#x02013;G or A&#x02013;U to G&#x02013;U), and scarce compensatory changes. The folding was considered consolidated by the phylogenetic analysis when equivalent secondary structures can be formed in all isolates (the results of the detailed phylogenetic study are presented in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S4, S5 and S6</ext-link>).</p><p>In the resulting models, most of the DMS and CMCT hits are in single-stranded regions, although weak hits were tolerated within unstable stems or at the extremity of helices. The majority of nuclease V1 sites are within helical regions, but some of them left in single-strand region could reflect a yet unidentified pairing, or nucleotide stacking (nucleotide at a base of an helix, or within a structured loop for example). Finally, nucleotides protected from modification upon Mg<sup>2+</sup> addition were attributed to long range base pairings, unstable stem or left single-stranded, possibly reflecting an unidentified long-range interaction.</p><p>The three models share common elements, although SIV<sub>Mac</sub> and HIV-1 sequences are only 60 and 80% homologous to HIV-2 sequences respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).

The sequence of the stem is conserved within a considered species, although the sequence in the loop varies (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S4, S5 and S6</ext-link>). In HIV-2, it is followed by stem-loop termed P1-2, conserved in all HIV-2 isolates, but which has no homologues in HIV-1 and SIV<sub>Mac</sub>. The most striking feature of this model is P2; a central long-range base-pairing that can be modelled in the three species although with different sequences. In all three cases some nucleotides within this stem are susceptible to DMS or CMCT modification in absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Numerous conservative changes are observed within this stem in the three species considered. P2 is fragmented in two and three segments in HIV-2 and SIV<sub>Mac</sub>, respectively. It closes a central wheel from which emerge two to three stem-loops. Notably, the first, P3 is a G&#x02013;C rich stem which exposes a large A / purine-rich single-stranded region. In the case of HIV-1 and HIV-2, P3 is capped by a large unstructured loop in which we have modelled few base pairs which could account for the few V1 nuclease cleavages observed in this region. For SIV<sub>Mac</sub>, P3 is constituted of two segments interrupted by an A rich internal loop. In HIV-2 and SIV<sub>Mac</sub> secondary structures, two stem-loops are found directly 3&#x02032; of P3. The first, P3-2, is well supported by both the structure probing data and the phylogenetic analysis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S4 and S5</ext-link>). Nevertheless, in SIV<sub>Mac</sub> this structure, essentially composed of A&#x02013;U base pairs is formed only upon Mg<sup>2+</sup> addition. The second, P4 is a long helical domain constituted of three segments. The second initiation triplet of <italic>gag</italic> HIV-2, lies within the 3&#x02032; portion of the first internal loop of the P4 domain. Of note, this initiation codon is not conserved and is only present in the well-studied rod isolate (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S4</ext-link>). For HIV-1, only one relatively short stem-loop has been modelled between P3 and the 3&#x02032; portion of P2, it was named P4 although no sequence, structural or functional homology links it with either HIV-2 or SIV<sub>Mac</sub> P4. The last common feature of the three viruses structure is the P5 stem-loop that immediately follows the 3&#x02032; sequences of P2. The secondary structure models for the sequences located in 3&#x02032; of P5 are fairly divergent from a virus to another. For SIV<sub>Mac</sub>, this region appears mostly unstructured. Most of the 30 nucleotides downstream of HIV-2 P5 are hit by CMCT or DMS except for few bases including four nucleotides that are protected from modification upon Mg<sup>2+</sup> addition. This region was left single-strand, and is followed by a helical region P6 in which is embedded AUG<sub>896&#x02013;898</sub>. HIV-2 P6 is fully substantiated by the experimental probing profile and the phylogenetic analysis. For HIV-1 sequences, we have modelled four helical regions, numbered P6&#x02013;P9, the latest comprising AUG<sub>759&#x02013;761</sub> from which is initiated HIV-1 shorter isoform p40. No obvious functional or structural homology can be extrapolated between HIV-1 and HIV-2 P6. For HIV-1 sequences lying from U<sub>580</sub> to A<sub>660</sub>, we have modelled two alternative structures whether organised as two stem-loops P6 and P7, or as a two segment stem-loop that embeds P6 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data S7</ext-link>). Both models are supported by the phylogenetic study, and the co-existence of both structures would better explain the modification profile obtained than a single conformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Defining the IRES determinants by directed mutagenesis</title><p>To assay the importance of the secondary structure modelled for the translation, we have mutated two of the conserved elements and evaluated the mutation effects on the IRES activity. We first introduced mutations on the 5&#x02032; or the 3&#x02032; side of P2: mutP2-5&#x02032;: <sub>581</sub>GCA GAU GAA<sub>589</sub> to <sub>581</sub><italic>AAU</italic> GAU <italic>C</italic>AA<sub>589</sub> and mutP2-3&#x02032;: <sub>785</sub>ACU GUC UGC<sub>793</sub> to <sub>785</sub>AC<italic>G</italic> GUC <italic>AUU</italic><sub>793</sub>, both mutants drastically destabilise the first segment of P2 [&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>mutP2&#x02013;5</sub><sub>&#x02032;</sub> &#x02212; &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>WT</sub> = 6.9 kcal and &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>mutP2&#x02013;3</sub><sub>&#x02032;</sub> &#x02212; &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>WT</sub> = 5.6 kcal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)]. Both HIV-2 AUG<sub>1</sub>mutP2-5&#x02032; and HIV-2 AUG<sub>1</sub>mutP2-3&#x02032; are severely impaired for <italic>in vitro</italic> translation. The proportion of the three isoforms remains unchanged as compared to the wild type, but the yield of each protein is 5-fold reduced in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The two sets of mutations, were combined on the same RNA, thus restoring P2 pairing with a new sequence (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>mutP2&#x02013;5</sub><sub>&#x02032;</sub><sub>/3</sub><sub>&#x02032;</sub> &#x02212; &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>WT</sub> = 1.3 kcal). The resulting leaderless RNA, HIV-2 AUG<sub>1</sub>mutP2-5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;, is almost as efficiently translated as the WT constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This strongly suggests that P2 is an important structural determinant of the IRES activity, while its sequence is not. As a first step to characterise another element of the coding region structure, we deleted the whole P4 helical segment taking care of preserving the open reading frame (mut&#x00394;P4: 5&#x02032;<sub>682</sub> A G<sub>683</sub> (&#x00394;) <sub>759</sub>CA GAA<sub>763</sub> 3&#x02032;). The coding region of this mutant is 75-nucleotides shorter than the wild type, and AUG<sub>756&#x02013;758</sub> has been deleted, thus its translation should yield only two isoforms. The molecular weight of the longer should be 2750 Da less than its wild-type homologue while the shorter should remain unchanged. Indeed we observed the two expected proteins; the yield of the shortest isoform is not affected, while the translation efficiency of the &#x02018;full length&#x02019; protein is 3-fold reduced, taking into account that the mut&#x00394;P4 misses one methionine as compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). This shows that the presence of the helical domain P4 is essential for the optimal IRES activity, although we can not tell at this stage whether it contains an important structure or sequence.

This confers to HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region the unique property to be more efficiently translated as a leaderless RNA, than when it is preceded by its cognate 5&#x02032;UTR. Here we show that this phenomenon is conserved among primate lentiviruses. The present study also demonstrates that the translation efficiency of the leaderless RNA relies on the structural integrity of the coding region. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>in vitro</italic> the presence of the 5&#x02032; UTR directly or indirectly interferes with the active folding of the IRES. Two interactions between the 5&#x02032;UTR and the coding region have been described and could interfere with the productive folding of the IRES (see below). Most interestingly, one of them occludes the initiation codon. It has recently been shown that in HIV-2 a minor splicing event disrupts this interaction, thus stimulating <italic>gag</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, it should be noted that this interaction does not influence HIV-1 translation and no such splicing event seems possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>HIV Gag IRES shows several other peculiarities that distinguishes it from other described IRES. First, the analysis of the initiation complexes paused on HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region yielded interesting results clearly distinguishing the lentiviral IRES from other viral IRESes described. We report here that up to three 48S or 80S complexes can be formed on the same mRNA. At this stage, we can not tell if the recruitment of complexes is ordered, and if RNA structural rearrangements may happen after recruiting each complex. This is in clear contrast with HCV or CrPV IRESes which can recruit only one initiation complex. Those IRESes adopt a three-dimensional structure that specifically binds the 40S ribosomal subunit. At this step, most of the surface of the folded RNA is hindered by one 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39">37&#x02013;39</xref>). In those cases, it would clearly not be possible to accommodate more than one 40S subunit on a single RNA in contrast to what we observed with HIV-2-<italic>gag</italic>. In this respect, HIV <italic>gag</italic> IRES may be compared to type II picornaviruses IRES, exemplified by the FMDV IRES which directs initiation from two in frame initiation codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In this case it has not been investigated if two initiation complexes can coexist on the same RNA.</p><p>Using different primers and cycloheximide, we were able to identify initiation complexes on all three AUG triplets of HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic>. In each case, the toeprints observed are consistent with the initiation codon present in the P or the E site of 80S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The signals observed appear to be relatively weak with respect to the translation efficiency and the large amount of complexes observed on sucrose gradients. This could be inherent to the system we study. Indeed, reverse transcriptase is expected to disrupt the structure of the RNA 3&#x02032; to the AUG triplet where, in this peculiar case, lie the determinants necessary for recruiting the initiation complex. This could destabilise most of the 80S/mRNA complexes, although they are efficiently formed as shown by the sucrose gradient analysis. This would also explain why we were unable to detect GMP&#x02013;PNP paused 48S complexes which association is expected to be more labile than the 80S. However, the reverse transcriptase stops are specific, since they are observed only upon cycloheximide addition and disappear upon mutation of the AUG initiation codon to a CUC triplet. The toeprints observed on HIV-1 and HIV-2 AUG<sub>1</sub> are particularly interesting because sequences upstream of the initiation codon, usually lying within the mRNA channel are missing. The multiple stops observed probably also reflect the poor stability of the complex. These toeprints are reminiscent of those observed with initiation complexes reconstituted in absence of eIF1, conditions upon which the otherwise inefficient formation of initiation complexes on a 5&#x02032; proximal AUG is strongly stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Besides, we show here that alternative initiation triplets are efficiently recognised although they are not in an optimal &#x02018;Kozak&#x02019; context. Knowing that eIF1 is a major determinant for non-AUG initiation triplet discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), it is questionable whether or not the complexes recruited on HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> contain eIF1.</p><p>Another peculiarity lies in the ability of HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> IRES to support translation from at least four initiation sites, including an alternative initiation triplet located within P4 (CUG<sub>692&#x02013;694</sub>). This is another marked difference with the HCV and CrPV IRESes which direct initiation from a single initiation site precisely defined by the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>An RNA structure responsible for the IRES activity</title><p>In this study we modelled the secondary structure of an isolated fragment of the <italic>gag</italic> open reading frame, sufficient for internal entry of the ribosome in three different viruses. Those models were established after the reactivity of individual nucleotides towards chemical and enzymatic probes, and the obtained models were confronted to the phylogenetic data available for each virus. We had previously reported a model for HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), that was re-evaluated to better take into account the probing results and the phylogenetic data. The region spanning from U<sub>600</sub> to C<sub>654</sub> had been folded as two stem-loops, it is now modelled as a single G&#x02013;C rich hairpin P3, which is fully substantiated by the probing data, and is furthermore similar to the P3 stem-loop modelled for SIV<sub>MAC</sub> and HIV-1 sequences. On the same bases, we also remodelled the sequences from G<sub>794</sub> to A<sub>854</sub> as one stem-loop, P5, followed by a long single-strand region. Secondary structure models for HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> gene have previously been established using RNA comprising the whole 5&#x02032; UTR and a fraction or the whole coding sequence, <italic>in vitro</italic> or in various <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). Those three models are fairly similar and comparable to ours, except for interactions between the 5&#x02032;UTR and the open reading frame that are obviously absent from our model. Nucleotides surrounding AUG<sub>336&#x02013;338</sub> can interact with the U5 region within the 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), here this region was part of a short stem-loop, P1. Both structures may alternatively exist, or P1 might be an artefact due to the shortened RNA construct we probed. In any case, we have previously reported that the P1 and P1-2 region of HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> could be deleted without entailing any modification of the IRES properties of the open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Similarly, because of the absence of the 5&#x02032;UTR in our construct, we could not detect the poly(A)-P3 loop pseudo-knot described for HIV-1 gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), the corresponding region within the coding region (G<sub>443</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>449</sub>) is not, or marginally, structured in our model and is thus available for such an interaction. Interestingly, P2, the basal part of P3, and P5 are similar in all models published to date, and those features are the most obvious structural similarities in the three primate viruses. For the three viruses, we found that many nucleotides within the long-range base pairing P2 are protected from modification upon magnesium addition. In HIV-1, they were also found to be weakly hit by single-strand specific nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), and are protected from a single-strand-specific chemical probe by the nucleocapsid in virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Here we show that this conserved pairing is important for HIV-2 <italic>gag</italic> IRES to promote translation from the three AUG. Mutations on each sides of P2 equally affects the three isoforms production. This could mean that recruitment on the three AUG relies on common determinants or, that P2 destabilisation leads to an overall unproductive alternative folding. The helical domain, P4 also influences the IRES activity although it is not crucial. The fact that the translation is not completely abolished in our mutants may reflect an indirect rather than a direct role for those structures. In other words, P2 and P4 may not be critical binding sites, but may be important to maintain the global architecture of the IRES and/or prevent alternative folding. Those structures could, for example, be important to expose the A-rich sequences present in the P2&#x02013;P3&#x02013;P4 domain and known to be potential IRES determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Such an hypothesis could explain how sequences spanning form AUG<sub>1</sub> to AUG<sub>2</sub> or from AUG<sub>2</sub> to AUG<sub>3</sub> retain some of the IRES activity although neither P2 nor P4 can not be formed in any of those two fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>According to the structure conservation and our mutagenesis data, we expect P2, P3 and P5 to be the major determinants involved in ribosome recruitment. We can only speculate on the role of this IRES, but the structural and functional conservation testifies for its physiological role. It is obvious from our experiments that it promotes a very efficient 5&#x02032;UTR independent translation initiation. This property could ensure Gag production when the 5&#x02032;UTR inhibition is relieved, for example, upon structural rearrangement induced by the binding of a protein, or a splicing event. The identification of a conserved core for lentiviral <italic>gag</italic> IRES will enable subsequent studies towards the elucidation of the molecular mechanism. If its peculiarity is confirmed, the phenomenon would be a therapeutic target of choice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1109/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>ATIPE from CNRS and a grant from the &#x02018;Agence Nationale pour la Recherche sur le S.I.D.A&#x02019; (ANRS).
