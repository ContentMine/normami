allotetraploid cotton.</p></abstract><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cotton fiber development undergoes rapid and dynamic changes in a single cell type, from fiber initiation, elongation, primary and secondary wall biosynthesis, to fiber maturation. Previous studies showed that cotton genes encoding putative MYB transcription factors and phytohormone responsive factors were induced during early stages of ovule and fiber development.

The 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were more abundant and highly enriched in ovules and fiber-bearing ovules relative to leaves. A total of 31 miRNA families, including 27 conserved, 4 novel miRNA families and a candidate-novel miRNA, were identified in at least one of the cotton tissues examined. Among 32 miRNA precursors representing 19 unique miRNA families identified, 7 were previously reported, and 25 new miRNA precursors were found in this study. Sequencing, miRNA microarray, and small RNA blot analyses showed a trend of repression of miRNAs, including novel miRNAs, during ovule and fiber development, which correlated with upregulation of several target genes tested. Moreover, 223 targets of cotton miRNAs were predicted from the expressed sequence tags derived from cotton tissues, including ovules and fibers. The cotton miRNAs examined triggered cleavage in the predicted sites of the putative cotton targets in ovules and fibers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Enrichment of siRNAs in ovules and fibers suggests active small RNA metabolism and chromatin modifications during fiber development, whereas general repression of miRNAs in fibers correlates with upregulation of a dozen validated miRNA targets encoding transcription and phytohormone response factors, including the genes found to be highly expressed in cotton fibers. Rapid and dynamic changes in siRNAs and miRNAs may contribute to ovule and fiber development in allotetraploid cotton.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cotton fibers are seed trichomes that extend from fertilized ovules. Cotton fiber is among the longest single cells and may grow as long as 6 cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cotton fiber cell initiation and elongation are directly affected by plant phytohormones. Auxin and gibberellins are known to promote fiber cell initiation and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sequencing analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from immature ovules and fiber-bearing ovules reveals an enrichment of the transcripts associated with <italic>Auxin Response Factors </italic>(<italic>ARFs</italic>) and gibberellin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Brassinosteroid and ethylene also positively affect fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], whereas abscisic acid and cytokinin inhibit fiber cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, cotton genes encoding putative MYB transcription factors are induced during early stages of fiber development but repressed in a naked seed mutant that is impaired in fiber formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The data agree with the known roles of MYB and other transcription factors in leaf trichome development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and cotton fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Many genes encoding putative transcription and phytohormone responsive factors are targets of microRNAs (miRNAs).</p><p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and miRNAs are 21- to 24-nucleotide small RNAs produced in diverse species that control gene expression and epigenetic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, plants produce <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], stress-induced natural antisense siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and pathogen-induced long siRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. miRNA loci are transcribed by RNA polymerase II into primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are processed by nuclear RNaseIII-like enzymes such as Dicer and Drosha in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and DICER-LIKE proteins (for example, DCL1) in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The mature miRNAs are incorporated into Agonaute complexes that target degradation or translational repression of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As a result, miRNAs play important roles in plant development, including cell patterning and organ development, hormone signaling, and response to environmental stresses such as cold, heat, pathogens and salinity.</p><p>Mature miRNAs are often identified by computational analysis and/or experimental approaches such as cloning and sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As of March 2009, release 13.0 of the miRBase database contains 3,788 plant miRNA entries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although many transcription and phytohormonal factors are the targets of miRNAs and are predicted to play a role in cotton fiber development, the small RNA data are limited in cotton partly because cotton genome sequence is unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Only a dozen miRNAs have been identified through computational analysis of cotton ESTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and low-throughput sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Few precursor structures are deposited in the miRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A recent study using high-throughput sequencing found 34 conserved miRNAs and eight EST loci encoding conserved miRNAs in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To enrich our knowledge of small RNAs in cotton fiber development, we analyzed miRNAs during early stages of fiber and ovule development. We sequenced and analyzed approximately 4 million small RNAs in cotton leaves, immature ovules, and fiber-bearing ovules. The 24-nucleotide small RNAs were highly enriched in fiber-bearing ovules in cotton. We found 27 conserved families of miRNAs, identified 4 new miRNAs, and predicted 32 miRNA precursors representing 19 unique families. A total of 223 miRNA targets were computationally predicted, and a subset of these was experimentally validated. Many miRNAs, including novel miRNAs, were repressed during early stages of fiber development, which was consistent with upregulation of eight targets tested. An enrichment of siRNAs in fiber-bearing ovules and down-regulation of miRNAs in fibers suggest important roles for small RNA-mediated gene regulation in the process of rapid fiber cell development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Distribution of small RNAs in cotton</title><p>To characterize small RNAs in cotton, we made four barcoded sequencing libraries using total RNAs extracted from leaves, immature ovules (3 days prior to anthesis, -3 DPA), ovules with fiber cell initials (on the day of anthesis, 0 DPA), and young fiber-bearing ovules (3 days post-anthesis, +3 DPA) in <italic>Gossypium hirsutum </italic>L. cv. Texas Marker-1 (TM-1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). A total of 4,104,491 sequence reads of 17 to 32 nucleotides in size were generated in a pooled sample containing four barcoded libraries using an Illumina 1G Genome Analyzer. The reads were parsed into each library using a barcode base at the 5' end and an adaptor base at the 3' end. After removal of adaptor sequences, we identified the reads matching known cellular small RNAs, mitochondrial, and plastid sequences (approximately 6%). A large amount of raw reads, ranging from 6.4% in the ovules to 53.8% in the leaves, matched rRNAs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This suggests that a high proportion of rRNAs are degraded in leaves. Alternatively, the rRNA genes in leaves may be subjected to silencing or nucleolar dominance via RNA-mediated pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics of small RNA sequence reads</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="5">All reads (%)</th><th align="center" colspan="5">Distinct reads (%)</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="5"><hr/></th><th colspan="5"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Library</th><th align="right">Leaf</th><th align="right">-3 DPA</th><th align="right">0 DPA</th><th align="right">+3 DPA</th><th align="right">Total</th><th align="right">Leaf</th><th align="right">-3 DPA</th><th align="right">0 DPA</th><th align="right">+3 DPA</th><th align="right">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Matching CGI9 (EST assembly)</td><td align="right">51.60</td><td align="right">31.83</td><td align="right">9.48</td><td align="right">10.58</td><td align="right">25.92</td><td align="right">13.91</td><td align="right">12.12</td><td align="right">4.52</td><td align="right">3.97</td><td align="right">5.54</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Matching <italic>G. raimondii </italic>(genomic trace reads)</td><td align="right">61.25</td><td align="right">42.67</td><td align="right">24.99</td><td align="right">24.57</td><td align="right">38.42</td><td align="right">26.83</td><td align="right">23.47</td><td align="right">19.26</td><td align="right">17.56</td><td align="right">18.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Matching miRNAs</td><td align="right">0.80</td><td align="right">1.82</td><td align="right">0.82</td><td align="right">1.19</td><td align="right">1.06</td><td align="right">0.09</td><td align="right">0.13</td><td align="right">0.05</td><td align="right">0.06</td><td align="right">0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Other cellular RNAs</td><td align="right">57.88</td><td align="right">39.10</td><td align="right">8.21</td><td align="right">9.39</td><td align="right">27.96</td><td align="right">17.87</td><td align="right">14.92</td><td align="right">3.55</td><td align="right">3.03</td><td align="right">5.95</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;rRNA</td><td align="right">53.83</td><td align="right">29.56</td><td align="right">6.37</td><td align="right">7.03</td><td align="right">24.47</td><td align="right">16.25</td><td align="right">11.42</td><td align="right">2.82</td><td align="right">2.20</td><td align="right">4.88</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;tRNA</td><td align="right">3.09</td><td align="right">7.97</td><td align="right">1.48</td><td align="right">2.00</td><td align="right">2.82</td><td align="right">0.90</td><td align="right">2.54</td><td align="right">0.45</td><td align="right">0.58</td><td align="right">0.68</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;snoRNA</td><td align="right">0.02</td><td align="right">0.31</td><td align="right">0.01</td><td align="right">0.02</td><td align="right">0.05</td><td align="right">0.03</td><td align="right">0.14</td><td align="right">0.01</td><td align="right">0.02</td><td align="right">0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;snRNA</td><td align="right">0.02</td><td align="right">0.04</td><td align="right">0.01</td><td align="right">0.01</td><td align="right">0.01</td><td align="right">0.03</td><td align="right">0.06</td><td align="right">0.02</td><td align="right">0.01</td><td align="right">0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Mitochondria</td><td align="right">0.02</td><td align="right">0.17</td><td align="right">0.04</td><td align="right">0.04</td><td align="right">0.04</td><td align="right">0.05</td><td align="right">0.27</td><td align="right">0.05</td><td align="right">0.04</td><td align="right">0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Chloroplast</td><td align="right">0.91</td><td align="right">1.05</td><td align="right">0.29</td><td align="right">0.30</td><td align="right">0.57</td><td align="right">0.62</td><td align="right">0.49</td><td align="right">0.20</td><td align="right">0.18</td><td align="right">0.29</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total raw reads</td><td align="right">1,359,250</td><td align="right">372,521</td><td align="right">639,801</td><td align="right">1,732,919</td><td align="right">4,104,491</td><td align="right">526,304</td><td align="right">191,591</td><td align="right">505,504</td><td align="right">1,180,742</td><td align="right">2,169,534</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; snRNA, small nuclear RNA.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sequencing flow chart and size distribution of small RNAs in cotton. <bold>(a) </bold>Flow chat of small RNA library construction and sequencing.

These sequences were analyzed using BLAST against the cotton EST assembly the Cotton Gene Index (CGI) version 9, which contains 350,000 ESTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Only 2.1 to 3.3% (average of approximately 2.3% or 49,899) of the distinct small RNA reads in leaves, immature ovules, and fiber-bearing ovules matched available cotton ESTs in the databases. Among them, 4,497 21-nucleotide small RNAs perfectly matched 3,203 ESTs, many of which were known miRNAs (see below), whereas 10,676 24-nucleotide small RNAs matched 12,036 ESTs. Approximately 500-Mb (approximately 0.6&#x000d7; genome equivalent) of <italic>G. raimondii </italic>whole-genome shotgun (WGS) trace reads were produced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] in a community sequencing project (Proposer: Andrew Paterson). <italic>G. raimondii </italic>is one of the probable progenitors for the allotetraploid cotton <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>. Over 15% of small RNA sequences in four libraries matched the WGS trace reads. Of these, 5,597 21-nucleotide small RNAs matched 13,872 WGS trace reads, most of which were known miRNAs, whereas 52,630 24-nucleotide small RNAs were mapped onto 233,999 WGS trace reads. Although these WGS trace reads represent only a small fraction of the <italic>G. raimondii </italic>genome, a nearly five-fold increase of the matches between 24-nucleotide small RNAs and WGS trace reads compared to the ESTs suggests that approximately 80% of the 24-nucleotide small RNAs sequenced are produced in intergenic regions, repeats, and transposons as they lack corresponding sequences in the large collection of cotton ESTs. Moreover, &#x0003e;85% (1,846,442) of the distinct sequences were singletons, which are reminiscent of the high number of singletons observed in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The data suggest that a quarter million to a million small RNA sequences in each tissue are far from saturation of the small RNA repertoire in cotton.</p></sec><sec><title>The most abundant small RNAs in cotton ovules are 24 nucleotides long</title><p>The most abundant size of cotton small RNAs is 24 nucleotides, followed by 26 nucleotides or longer and 22 nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Interestingly, 78 to 84% of small RNAs in the ovules (0 DPA) and fiber-bearing ovules (+3 DPA) were 24 nucleotides long. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the distribution of 24-nucleotide small RNAs is approximately 43% in leaves, approximately 61% in inflorescences, and approximately 41% in seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The 24-nucleotide small RNAs mainly consist of siRNAs that are associated with repeats and transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The high levels of 24-nucleotide small RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>inflorescences and developing cotton ovules compared to those in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and cotton leaves may suggest repression of these elements in ovules or inflorescences. Alternatively, repeats and other elements are normally repressed in the leaves but activated during rapid cell development. The consequence of 24-nucleotide small RNAs on fiber development remains to be investigated after the cotton genomes are sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Many 24-nucleotide small RNAs were apparently derived from transposons, including 10,499 and 9,869 24-nucleotide small RNAs from copia-like and gypsy-like retrotransposons, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A large number (73,001) of 24-nucleotide small RNAs matched unknown repetitive sequences, suggesting that transposons and repeats are highly diverged between cotton and other plants whose genomes are sequenced. The number of 24-nucleotide small RNA reads was normalized to transcripts per quarter million (TPQ) per megabase of repetitive sequences. The data indicated that the number of small RNAs matching known repeats and transposons present in the <italic>G. herbaceum </italic>and <italic>G. raimondii </italic>genomes was similar, but the number matching specific repetitive sequences, mostly the retrotransposons and transposons, was higher in <italic>G. raimondii </italic>than in <italic>G. herbaceum </italic>(Additional data file 1). Although the available repetitive sequences are relatively small in cotton, a relatively high amount of 24-nucleotide small RNAs may suggest repression of repetitive sequences, including retrotransposons of <italic>G. raimondii </italic>origin in tetraploid cotton.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of miRNAs in cotton</title><p>We adopted the common criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] to identify known miRNAs and/or precursors in cotton. First, a cotton miRNA must have sequence conservation and homology to orthologous miRNAs in other species. Second, if a miRNA matches known ESTs, the stem-loop structure clearly shows miRNA and miRNA* in the opposite arm of a duplex. Many miRNAs contain a sequenced miRNA* species with 2-nucleotide 3' overhangs, providing strong evidence for a DCL1-processed stem-loop. Third, base paring occurs extensively within the region of the miRNA and an arm of a predicted hairpin. Finally, the miRNA contains minimal asymmetric bulges (less than four).</p><p>Using these criteria, we identified 27 miRNA families that were present in one or more tissues examined in <italic>G. hirsutum </italic>L. (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Ten of them (Gh-miR156, 159, 164, 165/166, 167, 168, 171, 172, 535, and 894) were present in all four tissues. The majority of miRNAs were detected in leaves. Gh-miR390 and 393 were found in the fiber-bearing ovules (0 and +3 DPA) but were absent in immature ovules (-3 DPA). Several miRNAs that were recently identified by deep-sequencing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including miR827 and miR828 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], were also found in cotton. Gh-miR165/166 and a candidate novel miRNA (see below) were most abundant, followed by Gh-miR167, 168, 156/157, 172, 171, 390, 535, and 894. The abundance of Gh-miR165/166 was 3,979 TPQ in leaves and 7,340, 1,902, and 2,728 TPQ in ovules at -3, 0, and +3 DPA, respectively.

This suggests that miRNA precursors have been underrepresented in the EST database, despite a large number of EST sequencing efforts in cotton. The ESTs are primarily derived from the allotetraploid cotton (<italic>G. hirsutum</italic>) and close relatives of its probable progenitors, <italic>Gossypium arboreum </italic>and <italic>Gossypium raimondii</italic>. Many ESTs are partial sequences of full-length cDNAs, and the representation of ESTs in early stages of fiber development is relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>We compared the stem loop structures of a few miRNAs that contain predicted miRNA precursor hairpins in cotton with the corresponding ones in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and cottonwood (<italic>Populus</italic>).

These ESTs may be derived from paralogous and/or homoeologous sequences in allotetraploid cotton, and their miRNAs should belong to the same family. The mature miRNA ratio of Gh-miR482 to Gh-miR482* was 8:1 (40:5 total reads). Interestingly, another miRNA, Gh-miR482-5p, was derived from the 5' end of the EST (DW517596) with 24 reads, and Gh-miR482-5* was derived from the 3' end of the EST with only 1 read, resulting in a ratio of 24:1 (miRNA to miRNA*) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). In the canonical miRNA sequences, the level of divergence is higher between Gh-miR482-5p and Gh-miR482 than between Gh-miR482-5p* and Gh-miR482*. Gh-miR482-5p and Gh-miR482 were in the opposite strands of different ESTs and expected to target different sets of genes. Common features such as a 4- to 5-bp bulge in the 3' end proximal to the loop were found in the stem loop structures of <italic>GhMIR482 </italic>and <italic>PtMIR482</italic>, but not in <italic>GhMIR482-5p</italic>. Although miRNAs can be found in both 3' and 5' ends of precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Gh-miR482-5p has not been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>or cottonwood and is considered a new miRNA, named Gh-miR2948. In addition, miR2948 has a miR2948* that closely matches miR482, indicating that miR2948 has likely evolved from the miR484 family. One of the Gh-miR2948 targets is predicted to encode a sucrose synthase-like gene (ES815756; Additional data file 3). Sequencing reads indicated lower levels of Gh-miR2948 in both immature and fiber-bearing ovules than in leaves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), which correlates with upregulation of the sucrose synthase gene (U73588) in early stages of fiber cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the new miRNA Gh-miR2948, we identified three novel miRNAs and one candidate-novel miRNA in cotton using the commonly adopted criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. After extensive computational analysis of potential precursors against ESTs in CGI9, we selected the list of candidates with miRNA* sequence present on the opposite strands of predicted hairpin structures. According to miRBase, the three new cotton miRNA families were named Gh-miR2947, Gh-miR2949, and Gh-miR2950, and their corresponding loci were named <italic>Ga-MIR2947</italic>, <italic>Gh-MIR2949</italic>, and <italic>Gh-MIR2950</italic>, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The precursor of Gh-miR2947 was derived from an EST of <italic>G. arboreum</italic>, and the corresponding locus was named <italic>Ga-MIR2947</italic>. The miRNA to miRNA* ratios were 80:1 in Gh-miR2947, 39:1 in Gh-miR2949, and 8:5 in Gh-miR2950. Gh-miR2949a, b, and c matched three ESTs (AI054573, EV497941, TC94314, respectively) that are putative precursors (Additional data file 2), implying multiple members of this miRNA family. Gh-miR2947 was predicted to target a cotton EST encoding a putative serine/threonine protein phosphatase 7 homolog. Six ESTs encoding endosomal proteins were the predicted targets of Gh-miR2949 (Additional data file 3). Among five putative EST targets of Gh-miR2950, two encode putative gibberellin 3-hydroxylase 1 in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>. The candidate-novel miRNA (Gh-miRcand1) is 22 nucleotides long and has a canonical 5' U. Gh-miRcand1 had the most abundant sequence reads (approximately 39,860; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and was detected by small RNA blot analysis. Moreover, it matched three EST targets that encode NAC domain transcription factors, but its potential precursors were not found in the EST databases.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression of conserved miRNAs in cotton</title><p>To further characterize cotton miRNAs, we employed miRNA microarrays (CombiMatrix, version 9.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] to determine miRNA accumulation patterns in cotton fibers and non-fiber tissues.

Gh-miR167 and Gh-miR164 accumulated at higher levels in fiber-bearing ovules than in other tissues examined.

The mixed RNA may obscure the target cleavage in a specific tissue but would allow us to determine if a specific target is cleaved by a corresponding miRNA during ovule and fiber development. miRNA-guided target cleavage was examined for 12 targets of 7 miRNAs (Gh-miR159, 160, 164, 165/166, 167, 172, and 390) and one candidate-novel miRNA (Gh-miRcand1) in cotton (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

The cleaved products were usually terminated at a position corresponding to the tenth position of complementarity from the miRNA 5' end. This is characteristic of a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-like processing event and provides evidence for miRNA-guided target cleavage in cotton.

Instead, miR160 triggered degradation in the predicted site for approximately 90% of the products of another target (TC118163) that encodes a putative ARF10 or ARF16 (Additional data file 3).

Although the reads of other small RNAs may be inflated by relatively low abundance of miRNAs in these tissues, the total amount of miRNA reads is relatively small. The amount of 24-nucleotide small RNAs accounts for 78 to 84% of total small RNA reads (approximately 3 million reads) in fiber-bearing ovules (from 0 to +3 DPA), but only approximately 50% in leaves and approximately 57% in immature ovules. Most 24-nucleotide small RNAs are derived from endogenous repeats, including transposons and pseudogenes, and are known as repeat associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs). Although encoding loci for many rasiRNAs are unknown, a proportion of siRNAs is derived from lineage-specific retrotransposons in diploid cotton species, including <italic>G. raimondii </italic>and <italic>G. herbaceum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These findings are reminiscent of uniparental inheritance of polymerase IV (PolIV)-associated 24-nucleotide siRNAs in young ovules and developing seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and rapid changes in siRNAs and miRNA expression in closely related species and allotetraploids of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Effector complexes containing rasiRNAs, Argonaute (AGO)4, and PolV directed DNA methylation and chromatin modifications through the activities of additional factors, including Domains rearranged methylase 1 and 2 (DRM1 and DRM2), Chromomethylase 3 (CMT3), and SU(VAR)3-9 homologue 4 (SUVH4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The rasiRNAs are virtually absent in the single-cell alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and constitute less than 10% of total reads in moss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], suggesting an expansion of siRNAs in land plants probably due to increased amounts of repetitive DNA and transposons, and in cotton to polyploidy. Rapid cell division and expansion during early stages of fiber development may reprogram chromatin structures and lead to increased siRNA production, which in turn induces repressive chromatin structures involving DNA and histone methylation. Alternatively, the homoeologous genomes in allotetraploid cotton may be reprogrammed during fiber development, which activates rasiRNA production. Indeed, in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>allotetraploids, homoeologous-specific centromeric siRNAs are associated with DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Whether or not the repeat-associated genes are methylated during fiber development remains to be investigated.

In addition to EST precursors, putative precursord for <italic>GhMIR164 </italic>and <italic>GhMIR167 </italic>were cloned by genomic walking and characterized (Additional data file 2).</p><p>Many canonical miRNAs are conserved among moss, eudicots, and monocots, and some have conserved functions among land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For example, the mature canonical miR167 in cotton is identical to that in poplar but has a one-nucleotide substitution relative to that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The 5' and 3' ends of miR165 are conserved among the canonical sequences in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, cotton and poplar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) but show three to four nucleotide changes in the middle, which may affect target specificity. The high degree of sequence conservation among miRNAs may explain why miRNA probes designed from different species such as rice, corn, and soybean can cross-hybridize with cotton miRNAs in the microarray analysis. However, data obtained using a heterologous microarray system should be cautiously interpreted and experimentally validated because sequence variation in some miRNAs may cause hybridization differences. Except for a few miRNAs, the identification of cotton miRNAs in this study is based on two or more methods, including miRNA sequence homology, precursor prediction, microarray expression, RNA blot analysis, target identification, and identification of miRNA* (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The conserved miRNAs may play important roles in cotton fiber and ovule development, as many predicted targets mediate biological pathways such as auxin response and cell patterning that previous studies have implicated in regulating cotton fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Four novel miRNA families, including Gh-miR2948 (miR482-5p), are particularly interesting because they are predicted to mediate the expression for a new set of genes that may affect cotton ovule and fiber development. Gh-miR2948 is identified in cotton but absent in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and poplar. One of its predicted targets (ES815756) encodes sucrose synthase, and another predicted target (ES798923) encodes a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family protein. Sucrose synthases are known to affect fiber cell initiation, elongation, and seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Suppression of sucrose synthase (<italic>SUS3</italic>, U73588) expression results in fiberless phenotypes and shrunken or collapsed ovules and seeds. Moreover, the level of <italic>sus3 </italic>suppression is associated with the degree of inhibition of fiber initiation and elongation. The genes encoding glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family protein are expressed in the developing roots and shoots, but their functions are not well understood. These data suggest that Gh-miR2948 has a potential role in the rapid and dynamic process of fiber cell initiation and elongation.</p><p>One of the Gh-miR2947 targets encodes a putative serine/threonine protein phosphatase 7. Gh-miR2949 is predicted to originate from three ESTs that are probably derived from homoeologous loci in allotetraploid cotton and related progenitors. For example, two precursors of cotton miR165 are derived from <italic>G. hirsutum </italic>and <italic>G. raimondii</italic>, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, the targets of Gh-miR2950 include a gene encoding gibberellin 3-hydroxylase 1, which controls internode elongation in pea, originally described by Gregor Mendel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. A naturally occurring mutation in an orthologous gene in <italic>M. sativa </italic>is associated with a dwarf growth phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It is likely that Gh-miR2950 may affect fiber cell elongation.</p><p>Gh-miRcand1 has abundant sequence reads and is detected by small RNA blots in ovules and fibers but does not have predicted precursors from available cotton ESTs. Gh-miRcand1 guides infrequent degradation for a predicted target (TC121013) encoding a putative NAC domain transcription factor. This suggests that origin and function of novel miRNAs, including this candidate new miRNA, need further investigation after the cotton genomes are sequenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Down-regulation of miRNAs and its functional implications during early stages of fiber development</title><p>Normalized miRNA reads, miRNA microarrays, and miRNA blot analysis collectively show that many miRNAs accumulate at lower levels in fibers (10 DPA) and fiber-bearing ovules (3 DPA) than immature ovules 3 days prior to anthesis. Several conserved miRNAs, including cotton miR156, miR159, miR165, miR166, miR167, miR168, miR171, and miR172, were expressed at high levels in the immature ovules (-3 DPA) but at relatively low levels in fiber-bearing ovules and fibers. The low levels of miRNA accumulation in the fibers and fiber-bearing ovules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) may allow target gene expression that is required for fiber cell development, which is consistent with upregulation of several targets of miRNAs, including three novel miRNAs tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Moreover, the ESTs encoding putative phytohormone regulators and transcription factors were generally upregulated during early stages of fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus, miRNA regulation may be important to fine-tune developmental and metabolic pathways during early stages of fiber cell initiation and elongation. These miRNAs may serves as negative regulators for cotton fiber development if their targets play a positive role. Alternatively, these miRNAs may positively affect cotton fiber development if their targets are negative regulators.</p><p>Gh-miR168 is involved in feedback regulation of miRNA biogenesis because its target <italic>AGO1 </italic>is essential for miRNA biogenesis and for miRNA-guided mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. A low level of miR168 expression in the immature ovules at -3 DPA may result in a high level of <italic>AGO1</italic>, suggesting an active role of miRNAs during early stages of fiber cell initiation and ovule development. Two Gh-miR167 targets encode ARF6 and ARF8. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miR167 controls <italic>ARF6 </italic>and <italic>ARF8 </italic>expression patterns and affects the fertility of ovules and anthers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] probably because Gh-miR167 directs cleavage of targets that are negative regulators of an auxin response pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. <italic>OsGH3-2 </italic>is an auxin responsive transcript that encodes an IAA-conjugating enzyme in rice, and <italic>OsGH3-2 </italic>expression is regulated by miR167-mediated <italic>ARF8 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Overexpression of mutagenized miR167 targets <italic>ARF6 </italic>and <italic>ARF8 </italic>in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leads to sterility in ovules and anthers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Like Gh-miR167, the novel Gh-miR2950 was poorly expressed in fibers (+7 DPA), and two of its putative targets encoded putative gibberellin 3-hydroxylase 1 in cotton, suggesting a role for gibberellins in ovule and fiber cell development.</p><p>miR165/166 plays a critical role in shoot apical meristem initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and leaf polarity and pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The relatively high level of Gh-miR165/166 in immature ovules (-3 DPA) relative to fiber-bearing ovules (+ 3 DPA) may suggest a role for Gh-miR165/166 in fiber cell initiation, a process in some ways similar to shoot apical meristem initiation. Interestingly, the expression levels of these two miRNAs in fiber-bearing ovules (0 and +3 DPA) are higher in the <italic>N1N1 </italic>lintless mutants than in the wild type, suggesting negative effects of this miRNA on fiber cell development. The predicted targets of Gh-miR165/166 include a dozen ESTs encoding the class III HD-Zip proteins (Additional data file 3), many of which are differentially expressed during fiber development (data not show), suggesting that these targets are repressed by miR165/166 during the transition from immature ovules to rapid fiber initiation and development in cotton. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, class III HD-Zip proteins are required for the formation of a functional shoot apical meristem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Gh-miR165/166 guides cleavage of three HD-Zip protein 5 and 8 genes examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but is not obviously correlated with target gene expression levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This suggests that these targets are affected by other mechanisms, such as translational repression. Alternatively, they may not be the main targets of miR165/166 in cotton.</p><p>Auxin is a positive regulator of fiber initiation during ovule culture <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Gh-miR167 is expressed at higher levels in immature ovules (-3 DPA) and fiber-bearing ovules (0 and +3 DPA) than in isolated fibers (7 DPA) in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>. Gh-miR167 is also expressed in the ovules (+ 3 DPA) of <italic>G. raimondii </italic>and the <italic>N1N1 </italic>mutant, which develop ovules and seeds but do not produce lint fibers. Seven ESTs are predicted to be Gh-miR167 targets encoding ARFs, several of which are targeted for degradation by Gh-miR167 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). ARFs regulate fruit initiation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and tomato. A mutation in <italic>ARF8 </italic>results in the separation of fruit development from fertilization and produces seedless (parthenocarpic) fruit in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In tomato, <italic>ARF7 </italic>is expressed at a constantly high level in mature flowers and repressed within 2 days after pollination. Transgenic plants with decreased <italic>SlARF7 </italic>mRNA levels bear seedless fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The data suggest that Gh-miR167 regulates ovule development and seed formation and probably indirectly affects fiber development.</p><p>The difference in miR164 accumulation between fiber-bearing ovules in the tetraploids and fiber-poor ovules in <italic>G. thurberi </italic>and <italic>N1N1 </italic>mutant indicate that miR164 plays a role not only in early stages of fiber development but also in organ (ovule) formation in diploid and tetraploid species. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miR164 regulates the expression of <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 </italic>(<italic>CUC1</italic>) and <italic>CUC2</italic>, and overexpression of mutagenized <italic>CUC1 </italic>mRNA induces alterations in embryonic, vegetative, and floral development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The family of NAM/CUC transcription factors functions downstream of transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) in response to auxin, which is down-regulated by miRNAs. Accumulation of miR164 in elongating fibers suggests roles for auxin regulation and NAM-like genes in ovule and fiber development.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miR390 along with AGO7 acts in <italic>TAS3 </italic>tasiRNA biogenesis, allowing TAS3 regulation of <italic>ARF3 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. <italic>ARF3 </italic>and <italic>ARF4 </italic>function in organ asymmetry, and TAS3 tasiRNAs mediate regulation of these <italic>ARF </italic>genes, which affect leaf morphology, developmental timing and patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. miR390a is expressed at high levels during early stages of fiber development but at low levels in the leaves or fibers, suggesting potential roles for miR390 and TAS3 in ovule and fiber development through <italic>ARF3 </italic>and <italic>ARF4 </italic>regulation.</p><p>Auxin promotes the degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors by stimulating Aux/IAA binding to the auxin receptor F-box proteins, including TIR1, which brings Aux/IAA proteins to the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. miR393 is predicted to target <italic>TIR1 </italic>(Additional data file 3) and is expressed at higher levels in ovules (+3 DPA) and fibers (+7 DPA) than in ovules of the <italic>N1N1 </italic>mutant, suggesting that <italic>TIR1 </italic>regulation is important for fiber cell development. Upregulation of miR393 may lead to miRNA-triggered degradation of <italic>TIR1</italic>. Further analysis of <italic>TIR1 </italic>family mRNA and protein levels in cotton ovules with altered miR393 expression or expression of mutagenized <italic>TIR1 </italic>mRNA will help in understanding the functions of miR393 and <italic>TIR1 </italic>in fiber cell development.</p><p>MYB transcription factors mediate trichome development in leaves and fiber development in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A total of six ESTs encoding putative MYB family proteins are predicted to be the targets of several moderately and lowly conserved miRNAs, including cotton miR399 and miR828 (Additional data file 3). Although the exact functions of these miRNAs and specific cotton MYB transcription factor genes are unknown, cotton GaMYB2 is a homolog of GL1, which plays a role in fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Among 198 genes encoding MYB transcription factors in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, only a few are predicted to be the miRNA targets (by miR159 and miR828). Two miR828 targets are <italic>MYB82 </italic>and <italic>MYB113 </italic>in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In cotton, Gh-miR828 is predicted to target five ESTs encoding putative MYB transcription factors and one EST encoding ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA KINESIN 3 (ATK3). Kinesin-like proteins are known to affect cellulose microfibrils and cell wall strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. In general, the number of targets predicted in cotton was relatively large, probably because many EST tentative consensus (TC) sequences may contain paralogous and homoeologous transcripts derived from two progenitors' genomes in allopolyploid cotton. Alternatively, the number of ESTs may be artificially enlarged because of computational limitations in accurately predicting paralogous and homoeologous ESTs. Collectively, high levels of miRNA accumulation during early stages of fiber cell initiation and elongation may temporarily down-regulate some physiological pathways prior to fiber cell initiation. Towards fiber elongation, the accumulation levels of many miRNAs are decreased, which may promote signaling and metabolic pathways such as auxin and gibberellin signaling, cell patterning, and sucrose and cellulose biosynthesis that are essential for fiber cell initiation and elongation as well as ovule development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Analyses of massively parallel sequencing data, miRNA microarrays, small RNA blots, and target cleavage assays indicate that rapid and dynamic changes in gene expression and physiology are correlated with a general enrichment of 24-nucleotide siRNAs and repression of many miRNAs during ovule and fiber development in allotetraploid cotton. siRNAs are derived from a small proportion of large cotton EST collections but match relatively large amounts of WGS trace reads of the <italic>G. raimondii </italic>genome. The enrichment of siRNAs in ovules and fibers relative to non-fiber tissues, including leaves, suggests active small RNA metabolism and chromatin modifications during fiber development. The general repression of miRNAs, including novel miRNAs, in fibers correlates with upregulation of a dozen validated miRNA targets encoding transcription and phytohormone response factors, including genes such as <italic>ARFs </italic>and <italic>SUS3 </italic>that are found to be highly expressed in cotton fibers. This work provides a rich source of genomic and gene expression data and several new findings, including 4 novel miRNAs, one candidate-novel miRNA, 25 new miRNA precursors, and over 200 predicted targets, which will facilitate future studies on the role of miRNAs and siRNAs in cotton fiber development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Wild-type <italic>G. hirsutum </italic>L. cv.

LiCl precipitation may enrich large RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], but this did not seem to affect the size distribution of small RNAs in sequencing and small RNA blot analyses (see Results). RNA concentration was estimated using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and RNA quality was examined using denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. An aliquot of total RNA (75 &#x003bc;g) each prepared from ovules (-3, 0, 3 DPA) and leaves was run on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7 M urea) with RNA size markers. The small RNAs of 17 to 27 nucleotides were purified in a 15% polyacrylamide gel and ligated to the 5' RNA adaptors, resulting in 37- to 47-nucleotide RNAs. After the ligation with both 5' and 3' RNA adaptors, the RNA bands ranged from 57 to 87 nucleotides. After purification, the ligated RNAs from each sample were reverse-transcribed using primer pairs partially corresponding to the RNA adaptors. The first-stranded cDNAs in each sample were amplified using the primer pair that contains a specific nucleotide as a 'barcode.' The four 'barcoded' samples were pooled in equal amounts, and a small aliquot of pooled DNA was cloned and sequenced to determine the quality and representation of cloned products.
