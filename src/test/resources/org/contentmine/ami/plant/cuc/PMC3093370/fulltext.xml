Viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) produced by phytoviruses to counter plant defense may perturb plant developmental programs because of the collision of their inhibitory effects with the regulatory action of endogenous miRNAs and ta-siRNAs. This could explain the similar developmental aberrations displayed by Arabidopsis miRNA/ta-siRNA pathway mutants, including <italic>dcl1</italic>, and by some VSR-expressing plants. Nonetheless, the molecular bases for these morphological aberrations have remained mysterious, and their contribution to viral disease symptoms/virulence unexplored. The extent of VSR inhibitory actions to other types of endogenous small RNAs remains also unclear. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing constitutively HcPro, P19 and P15, three unrelated VSRs. We show that VSR expression has comparable, yet modest effects on known miRNA and ta-siRNA target RNA levels, similar to those observed using an hypomorphic <italic>dcl1</italic> mutation. However, by combining results of transcriptome studies with deep-sequencing data from immuno-precipitated small RNAs, additional, novel endogenous targets of miRNA and ta-siRNA were identified, unraveling an unsuspected complexity in the origin and scope-of-action of these molecules. Other stringent analyses pinpointed misregulation of the miR167 target AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF8) as a major cause for the developmental aberrations exhibited by VSR transgenic plants, but also for the phenotypes induced during normal viral infection caused by the HcPro-encoding <italic>Turnip mosaic virus</italic> (TuMV). Neither RNA silencing, its suppression by VSRs, nor the virulence/accumulation of TuMV was altered by mutations in <italic>ARF8</italic>. These findings have important implications for our understanding of viral disease symptoms and small RNA-directed regulation of plant growth/development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In the plant and animal RNA silencing pathways, small RNA molecules known as micro (mi)RNA and short-interfering (si)RNAs have key roles in development and antiviral defense, respectively. In turn, viruses counteract this defense by deploying specific virulence factors, referred to as Viral Suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs), which target distinct steps of the host silencing machinery. In the model plant species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, transgenic expression of distinct VSRs often incurs a set of strikingly recurrent developmental anomalies that resemble those triggered by viral infections. While these defects have been assumed to result from a general interference of VSRs with silencing-based mechanisms controlling cellular growth, their exact molecular basis has remained largely elusive. Here, we address this issue by demonstrating that misregulation of a single transcript encoding the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8, a target of miR167, underlies most, if not all, of the defects caused by VSR expression, both in transgenic and in an authentic infection context. Our study also highlights the value of VSRs as generic tools for the discovery or validation of endogenous RNA silencing targets. These results also have implications for our understanding of small RNA-based regulations in plants, and shed light on the possible origin of some of the symptoms elicited by viral diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA silencing in Arabidopsis entails the activities of four distinct paralogs of the RNaseIII Dicer, producing small RNAs with specialized functions <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Chapman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1) predominantly synthesizes microRNAs (miRNAs), 19-to-24-nucleotide (nt) in length, from non-coding primary transcripts called pri-miRNAs containing imperfect stem&#x02013;loop structures. Stepwise nuclear pri-miRNA processing produces mature miRNAs that are then 2&#x02032;-O methylated by HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1) and exported to the cytoplasm <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. One miRNA strand is stabilized in an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing, chiefly, the ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) silencing effector protein, whereas the passenger miRNA strand, or miRNA&#x0002a;, is degraded. The miRNA-loaded AGO1 then guides post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of complementary or partially complementary mRNAs by inhibiting their stability and/or translation <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Voinnet1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Hypomorphic mutations in <italic>DCL1</italic>, <italic>HEN1</italic> or <italic>AGO1</italic> cause severe developmental abnormalities, highlighting the important role for miRNAs in plant development. Accordingly, many miRNA targets are mRNAs encoding transcription factors required for patterning, control of cell identity and elongation, including transcripts for AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs), which modulate plant responses to the hormone auxin <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mallory1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nonetheless, other classes of miRNAs regulate non-developmental processes including basal metabolism and plant adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Voinnet1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Unlike miRNAs, populations of <italic>cis</italic>-acting, 24nt-long siRNAs produced by DCL3 direct cytosine methylation and other chromatin modifications at the endogenous loci that generate them, including transposable elements, DNA repeats, and complex gene arrays <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Matzke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. DCL4 generates 21nt-long siRNA populations that guide PTGS of endogenous transcripts, including <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), the biogenesis of which is initiated by miRNA-directed cleavage of specific, often non-coding precursor transcripts. This promotes complementary strand synthesis mediated by the RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE RDR6 that generates long dsRNA processed by DCL4 <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Vaucheret1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The ta-siRNAs then guide AGO1 to repress target mRNAs including those of ARF3 and ARF4, which are important determinants of leaf development during post-embryonic growth <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Adenot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Other classes of endogenous siRNAs are similarly loaded into AGO1, presumably also to direct endogenous PTGS. These include DCL4-dependent, 21nt-long, and DCL2-dependent, 22nt-long, siRNA populations that are produced from small hairpins or extensively base-paired RNA formed upon transcription of inverted-repeat (IR) loci. These hairpin and IR loci may also attract DCL3 activity, leading to the accumulation of corresponding 24nt-long siRNAs <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. DCL4, and to a lesser extent DCL2 and DCL3, additionally has a key role in antiviral defense by dicing dsRNA produced during replication of phytovirus genomes (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). The resulting siRNAs are methylated by HEN1 and incorporated into one or several AGO proteins directing PTGS of viral RNA as part of antiviral RISCs. AGO1 and AGO7 are good candidates as antiviral RISC effectors because hypomorphic <italic>ago1</italic> and null <italic>ago7</italic> mutants are hyper-susceptible to several viruses <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Morel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>As expected from the never-ending molecular arms race that characterizes nearly all host-parasite interactions, phytoviruses have evolved a vast array of proteins, called viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs), in order to multiply and invade plants systemically <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Studies in transgenic plants expressing RNAi constructs (as a surrogate to virus infection) have shown that VSRs may target many steps of antiviral silencing, including small RNA processing, stability and activity <italic>via</italic> AGO effectors (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). For instance, homo-dimers of the tombusviral P19 protein sequester viral- or hairpin-derived siRNA duplexes in a size-dependent manner to prevent their effective loading into antiviral RISCs <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Vargason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Many antiviral silencing factors are components of cellular pathways regulating host gene expression, including, and of note, HEN1, which methylates and protects all endogenous classes of small RNAs, as well as AGO1 and AGO7, effectors of miRNAs, ta-siRNAs and IR-derived siRNAs. Consequently, some VSRs are expected to interfere with endogenous silencing pathways as part of their counter-defensive action and, thus, to perturb plant developmental programs.</p><p>This hypothesis has been supported by various studies of Arabidopsis plants expressing constitutively distinct types of VSRs: in many cases, such plants display morphological abnormalities in leaves and inflorescences, reduced stature and fertility reminiscent of defects exhibited by hypomorphic miRNA mutants <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mallory2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Chapman2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing VSRs show alterations of ta-siRNA/miRNA and ta-siRNA/miRNA target levels. For instance, P19 sequesters and thereby stabilizes host miRNAs/miRNA&#x0002a; duplexes, preventing the activity of the mature miRNA strand <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Other transgenically expressed VSRs, such as the potyviral HcPro, cause a consistent elevation in mature miRNA steady state levels, possibly as a consequence of perturbed HEN1 activity <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mallory2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Chapman2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Arabidopsis plants stably expressing the P15 protein of pecluviruses, by contrast, do not display altered mature miRNA levels, but, like HcPro and P19 transgenics, they accumulate ectopically miRNA and ta-siRNA target transcripts, suggesting a general perturbation in miRNA-RISC activity <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The above and other studies have prompted the popular assumption that the developmental phenotype of VSR transgenic plants is an unintended consequence of the primary inhibition of the antiviral silencing machinery at some steps colliding with the host miRNA/ta-siRNA pathways. This assumption, however, may be only partly true because it assumes that the miRNA pathway does not contribute actively to antiviral defense, and that, as a corollary, plant viruses do not rewire endogenous silencing pathways in order to thrive in their hosts. However, miRNAs and other cellular small RNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of Arabidopsis basal and race-specific resistance against many pathogens, including viruses (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-RuizFerrer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of endogenous small RNA pathways by VSRs might also reflect a deliberate viral strategy to inhibit such immune systems. By extension, it could be argued that the onset of developmental or hormonal defects as a consequence of suppressed miRNA or endogenous siRNA activities might optimize the replication and spread of at least some viruses. Conversely, suppression of endogenous silencing pathways may be inconsequential to other virus types, and this may explain why some VSRs have narrower impacts in transgenic Arabidopsis, merely inhibiting RNAi and antiviral defense. For instance, the P6 protein of <italic>Caulimoviridae</italic> targets the DCL4-interacting protein DRB4 during siRNA biogenesis, without noticeable incidence on miRNA regulation in transgenic plants <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A related issue is whether the inhibition (targeted or fortuitous) of endogenous small RNA functions observed with certain VSR transgenes recapitulates some of the disease symptoms normally elicited by viruses during authentic infections. Indeed, those studies have mostly involved, so far, constitutive or inducible VSR expression in a much broader tissue range than is expected from natural infections (discussed in <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Voinnet2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>).</p><p>An additional question pertains to the exact molecular underpinnings of the morphological abnormalities induced by transgenic expression of P19, HcPro, P15 or other VSRs in Arabidopsis. The broad ectopic accumulation of miRNA targets seen in those plants would intuitively argue in favor of pleitropy owing to many compromised regulatory and developmental pathways. This idea is challenged, however, by the surprising recurrence and discrete nature of the observed defects, independent of the VSR under study (though their strength may vary depending on VSR expression levels). Hence, rosette leaves are invariably narrow, serrated and curled, the rosette diameter and leaf area are reduced, as are the weight of total aerial tissue and the length of primary bolts. P19, HcPro and P15 plants also display inflorescences with typically narrow and unusually long sepals; organs within internal whorls are usually exposed prior to opening, and flowers fail to release pollen, resulting in male sterility <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mallory2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Chapman2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These recurrent and discrete anomalies thus suggest that misregulation of only a discrete number of endogenous genes accounts for the VSR phenotype. The identity of these targets remains unknown, however, as does the nature of the possible endogenous small RNA pathway(s) (i.e. miRNA, ta-siRNA, endogenous IR-derived siRNAs) involved. Moreover, although an effect of VSRs at the level of AGO action is usually invoked to unify these observations, additional actions of VSRs on chromatin or primary miRNA/ta-siRNA transcription have never been formally ruled out. For instance, histone acetylation/deacetylation was recently identified as a broad-spectrum chromatin-based mechanism regulating miRNA production in Arabidopsis <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This overall lack of understanding of the VSR effects in transgenic settings has limited the use of these factors as tools for the identification of potentially novel endogenous small RNAs and their associated targets, both in Arabidopsis and other plant species. It was indeed anticipated that VSRs could be possibly used as weak alleles of RNA silencing mutations, but with a broader output because of the likely simultaneous interference of these factors with multiple endogenous silencing pathways <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Voinnet3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Through a systematic, comparative analysis of Arabidopsis lines over-expressing the tombusviral P19, potyviral HcPro or pecluviral P15 VSRs, the present study addresses many of the outstanding issues raised above. This analysis notably uncovers the as yet unexplained molecular feature that underlies the post-embryonic developmental phenotype exhibited in common by the three VSR transgenic plants. Moreover, this study establishes that the same molecular bases account for the developmental, but not metabolic, symptoms normally elicited by an authentic virus infection. Finally, our work demonstrates that virus-induced developmental aberrations, on the one hand, and pathogen virulence as a consequence of antiviral silencing suppression, on the other, can be uncoupled. These findings not only shed light on hitherto unsolved issues of viral diseases, but they also challenge current views on the roles and impact of endogenous small RNAs on plant growth and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>VSRs do not impact chromatin-level silencing or primary miRNA transcription, and have only modest effects on the accumulation of known miRNA and ta-siRNA target transcripts</title><p>The systematic analysis reported in this study involved previously characterized Arabidopsis lines expressing the potyviral HcPro, tombusviral P19 and pecluviral P15 VSRs under the constitutive 35S promoter from <italic>Cauliflower mosaic virus</italic> [18, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and method</xref>].

To this end, transcript levels and two histone modifications were analyzed along the Arabidopsis chromosome 4 using a custom-made tiling array (GSE24692; <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Turck1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>).

Likewise, histone marks were largely unaffected by VSR expression indicating that these proteins interfere with RNA silencing at the post-transcriptional level, consistent with previous studies showing that none of the three VSRs prevent accumulation of mature miRNAs <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mallory2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Chapman2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>We conclude that these factors likely interfere with Arabidopsis silencing pathways downstream of Dicer, presumably by inhibiting RISC-mediated repression of target transcripts, which may occur, at least partly, at the mRNA stability level. Consequently, we decided to analyze the changes in mRNA accumulation observed between WT and VSR-expressing plants, using a microarray approach (Data deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO], accession GSE24693). In order to define a threshold value for such changes, we first examined, in inflorescences, stems, leaves and roots of the VSR transgenic plants, the average expression changes of all known Arabidopsis miRNA and ta-siRNA target transcripts, as available in the miRbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org">http://www.mirbase.org</ext-link>) and ASRP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu">http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu</ext-link>; <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Gustafson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>) depositories. We found that more than 90&#x00025; of all known miRNA and tasiRNA target transcripts did not differentially accumulate in WT versus VSR plants: their accumulation was within the 0.8&#x02013;1.2 fold range in all four organs of the VSR transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A similar value was obtained upon analysis of <italic>dcl1-9</italic> plants, which display vastly reduced miRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Strikingly, in leaves, only 30&#x00025; of all target transcripts were found to over-accumulate in at least one VSR transgenic line, as compared to WT plants, and this figure was reduced to 11&#x00025; in the <italic>dcl1-9</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s003">Figure S3</xref>; results for the other organs are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s004">Figure S4A</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s006">S6A</xref>). Moreover, for those over-accumulating target mRNAs, expression changes were mostly in the 1.5-2 fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s004">Figure S4B</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s006">S6B</xref>).

We conclude that expression of P19, P15 or HcPro, like the <italic>dcl1-9</italic> mutation, incurs only modest changes to the accumulation of some miRNA and ta-siRNA target transcripts.

In other words, it was predicted that some of the above mutations would act as general, second-site suppressors of the VSR phenotype.

In addition, as expected, <italic>ARF8</italic> expression levels were reduced in these F1 heterozygous mutant plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s009">Figure S9E</xref> and data not shown). This <italic>arf8</italic>-dependent phenotype attenuation was not only observed in leaves, but also in inflorescences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) such that fertility of all three VSR lines was restored to near WT levels. While those VSRs with initially strong phenotypes in parental lines (HcPro and P19) still exhibited a low degree of leaf serration in the <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> heterozygous background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g004">Figure 4B, 4F</xref>, arrows), they were essentially undistinguishable from WT plants when the <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> mutation was brought to homozygocity, as exemplified with the independently genotyped [P19 x <italic>arf8&#x02013;6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>] plants presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g004">Figure 4H&#x02013;I</xref>.

First, the protein levels of the miRNA-processing enzyme DCL1 were not changed dramatically in <italic>arf8&#x02013;6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant as compared to WT plants, as were the levels of AGO1, the main effector of miRNA and siRNA actions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Likewise, inspection of available transcriptome data for <italic>arf8&#x02013;3<sup>-/-</sup> arf6&#x02013;2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double mutant plants did not reveal any significant changes in the transcript levels of major PTGS effector proteins and endogenous suppressors of silencing, as compared to WT plants, with the notable exception of AGO7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s014">Table S5</xref>).

Third, accumulation of the endogenous targets of those miRNAs was largely unaffected in <italic>arf8&#x02013;6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Using crosses to the <italic>CHS</italic> RNAi line <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we also confirmed that the <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> mutation did not affect PTGS mediated by siRNAs derived from long dsRNA, as the seed coat of all progeny plants remained pale, an indicator of <italic>CHS</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Suppression of <italic>CHS</italic> RNAi, manifested as brown seed coats, was, however, still observed in the VSR lines with the <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> heterozygous mutation, which nonetheless exhibited strongly attenuated developmental phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g004">Figure 4B, 4D and 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, the known effects of VSRs on CHS siRNA and endogenous miRNA accumulation were still observed in those crosses: as expected, both P15 and HcPro caused a strong reduction in 21nt CHS siRNA levels, while these remained unaffected by P19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Also as reported previously <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, HcPro and P19 (but not P15) caused respectively an increased accumulation and a slight mobility shift of endogenous miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). qRT-PCR analyses confirmed, additionally, that VSRs in both the heterozygous and homozygous <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> mutant background still displayed enhanced accumulation (a 1.5&#x02013;2 fold range on average) of several miRNA target transcripts, as observed in the parental VSR lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g005">Figure 5F</xref> and data not shown). We conclude that suppression of developmental defects by the <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> mutation in the VSR transgenic plants is merely accounted for by the correction of ARF8 transcript levels, independently of any other effects on RNA silencing.

TuMV is the potyvirus that naturally encodes the HcPro allele expressed in the VSR transgenic plants employed in the present study.

This was not only observed for experimentally established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s004">Figure S4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s006">S6</xref>), but also newly identified, putative targets. Although, the selection against high VSR expression and the hypomorphic nature of <italic>dcl1&#x02013;9</italic> might contribute to these effects, they are unlikely to form their sole basis. Indeed, modest changes in silencing target transcript levels were also noticed in studies of distinct alleles of <italic>dcl1</italic> in various ecotypes, displaying developmental alterations ranging from moderate to severe; the same was observed in comparative analyses of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing other types of VSRs that also impinge on miRNA and siRNA functions <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Todesco1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. More compellingly, a recent study of miRNA target mimics expressed under the strong 35S promoter also revealed a generally modest effect on miRNA target transcript levels, despite the generation of sometimes dramatic developmental phenotypes <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Todesco1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Collectively, these observations highlight an apparent discrepancy between the expected or observed biological outcome of miRNA action on the one hand, and the overall level of variation of target transcripts, on the other, which is in most cases within the range of haplo-sufficiency.</p><p>One aspect that could help reconcile, at least in part, this apparent discrepancy is the tissue- or even cell-type specific expression of small RNAs and/or their targets. <italic>In situ</italic>-hybridization and reporter gene fusion analyses indeed show that several, perhaps many, plant miRNAs display exquisitely defined expression patterns <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Parizotto1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Valoczi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, the above-mentioned analyses and the present one employed RNA extracted from whole organs, and this may artificially dilute spatially restricted, yet biologically highly significant, effects of some miRNAs on some target transcripts. According to this idea, a much higher spatial, and even temporal resolution might be required in future microarray-based analyses of plant small RNA action <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Voinnet1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A second, non-mutually exclusive possibility is that plant miRNA- and siRNA-mediated gene regulation entails a much wider translational inhibition component than is usually thought, such that only modest small RNA effects are manifested at the transcript level. Indeed, use of appropriate genetic background indicates that most, if not all, plant miRNAs (and, possibly, siRNAs) regulate their targets through a combination of slicing-based or translation-based inhibitory mechanisms whose respective prevalence is essentially unpredictable based on the position (5&#x02032; UTR, CDS, 3&#x02032; UTR), pairing degree, or multiplicity of small RNA binding sites <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Brodersen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In support of this idea, many Arabidopsis miRNAs are found on polysomes in association with AGO1 <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Lanet1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It is, in fact, striking that the amplitude of target mRNA expression changes (1.5&#x02013;2.5 fold) uncovered in this and other studies of Arabidopsis small RNAs falls within the range of variations typically observed for miRNA-repressed transcripts in metazoans. This modest, yet quantifiable reduction of transcript accumulation by metazoan small RNAs is not accounted for by slicing but, rather, by mRNA decay following deadenylation and decapping, which is coupled to translational repression <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Eulalio1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Fabian1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Fabian2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In plants, the bulk of target mRNA degradation is commonly ascribed to slicing, typically diagnosed by 5&#x02032; RACE analyses <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Llave1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Yet, hardly ever is this technique used quantitatively, so that the real contribution of slicing as opposed to other mechanisms of miRNA-induced transcript turnover (i.e. mRNA decay) is difficult to evaluate. mRNA decay as a consequence of small RNA-directed translational repression is yet to be described in plants, but it certainly deserves careful attention in future investigation of small RNA/target interactions in those organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Silencing target discovery through analysis of VSR transgenic plants</title><p>This study incidentally unraveled that combining comparative microarray analyses of individual VSR transgenic plants and target site predictions from AGO-IP reads is an original approach to the discovery of endogenous transcripts regulated <italic>via</italic> small RNAs at the post-transcriptional level. The approach was notably useful in uncovering somewhat poorly predictable instances of PTGS-based regulations, emphasizing the flexibility and intricate nature of the various RNA silencing pathways in Arabidopsis. For instance, some heterochromatic loci normally associated to the production of 24-nt siRNAs, might be sources of AGO1-loaded <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs, 21&#x02013;22-nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s008">Figure S8</xref>) while 5&#x02032;-A- or 5&#x02032;-G-terminal miRNA passenger strands may exert <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> regulatory effects upon their association with AGO1, which is prominently loaded with 5&#x02032;-U-terminal small RNAs <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Montgomery1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Hence, our observation with miR159b&#x0002a; and <italic>SHP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002035-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) possibly extends the range of transcription factors controlled by the <italic>MIR159b</italic> locus (at least in Arabidopsis), which normally targets MYB-related genes through the mature miR159 species. The prospect of miRNA passenger strands being used for regulatory purposes has not received much attention so far in plants, yet this phenomenon appears to be common in metazoans. In Drosophila, developmentally regulated mechanisms seem to determine the selection/usage of one or the other miRNA strand, and to engage them into distinct regulatory networks, possibly in a cell- or tissue-specific manner <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Ghildiyal1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Finally, the AGO1-IP approach applied to single VSR lines could also identify potential <italic>trans</italic>-targets of <italic>IR</italic>-derived siRNAs. In particular, we recently showed that <italic>IR71</italic>-derived siRNA populations can move between distant tissues through the vasculature, presumably to orchestrate gene regulation at a distance both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. At4g08390, encoding a stromal ascorbate peroxidase, is obviously a strong candidate for this type of regulation; moreover, its presumed function -detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, a molecule involved in defense reactions- is consistent with our recent finding that <italic>IR71</italic> transcription and ensuing siRNA production are strongly induced by viral and bacterial pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Undoubtedly, many additional occurrences will be uncovered through analysis of the non-exhaustive depository found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s008">Figure S8</xref> such that the approach and its possible refinements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s017">Text S2</xref>) will likely complement the tools already available for the discovery or validation of endogenous silencing targets and associated small RNAs in Arabidopsis. Although the method was restricted here to the analysis of sequencing reads from AGO1-IPs <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, it could, in principle, be adapted to small RNAs that are loaded into other types of AGOs with demonstrated or suspected functions in PTGS, and whose action is also likely inhibited by VSRs. These include Arabidopsis AGO10 and AGO5, which belong to the same genetic clade as AGO1, as well as AGO7, which directs cleavage of specific non-coding RNAs to initiate phased TAS3 ta-siRNA production <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Vaucheret2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. One advantage of the method is that it does not rely on specific mutations in RNA silencing pathway components (i.e <italic>AGO1</italic> or <italic>DCL1</italic>) but, rather, on the broad-spectrum inhibitory effects of VSRs upon the activity of PTGS-associated small RNAs, independently of their origin and of their AGO effector proteins.

Presumably, miR167 regulatory functions are, in this case, rescued by the function of an alternative AGO (e.g. AGO10) that is also affected by VSRs. This hypothesis predicts that the developmental defects of mutants in <italic>DCL1</italic>, which fail to accumulate most miRNAs, should, by contrast, be sensitive to <italic>arf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>. Indeed, introducing the <italic>arf8</italic> homozygous mutation into the <italic>dcl1&#x02013;7</italic> hypomorphic allele (ecotype Col-0) was reported to rescue the pleitropic phenotype and viability of this allele, although the molecular bases for this phenomenon was not explained at the time <xref rid="ppat.1002035-KatiyarAgarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Abrogation of silencing mutant developmental phenotypes by single mutations in miRNA target genes</title><p>We show, in this study, that the post-embryonic developmental anomalies of VSR plants can be largely ascribed to the misregulation of ARF8, presumably <italic>via</italic> an effect on miR167 activity. In support of this result, <italic>arf8&#x02013;6</italic> mutant plants expressing ectopically a miR167-resistant allele of <italic>ARF8</italic> (mARF8) are hardly viable, and the few T1 individuals that survive transformation, presumably because of low transgene expression levels, display strong sterility reminiscent of that seen in HcPro, P19 and P15 plants [51, Jason Reed, personal communication]. Moreover, and as explained in the previous section, the <italic>arf8</italic> mutation also attenuates the pleiotropy and fertility defects of <italic>dcl1&#x02013;7</italic> mutant Arabidopsis <xref rid="ppat.1002035-KatiyarAgarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Regulation of ARF8 by miR167 appears, therefore, central to Arabidopsis developmental biology. Recently, a mutation in an ethylene-induced transcription factor, RAV2, was also shown to partially suppress the developmental phenotype of HcPro transgenic Arabidopsis plants <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Endres1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Unlike in <italic>arf8</italic> mutant plants, however, this effect was only evident in homozygous <italic>rav2</italic> mutants, and it was accompanied by a strong inhibition of RNAi suppression by HcPro. While <italic>ARF8</italic> was not part of the set of genes previously found to be up-regulated in <italic>rav2</italic> mutant plants, analyses of available transcriptome data for the Arabidopsis <italic>arf8&#x02013;3<sup>-/-</sup> arf6&#x02013;2<sup> -/-</sup></italic> double mutant revealed that <italic>RAV2</italic> expression is induced, rather than repressed, in the tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002035.s015">Table S6</xref>). Therefore, the developmental anomalies of HcPro transgenic plants may result from defects in at least two parallel pathways with distinct molecular bases.</p><p>Abrogation of the VSR or <italic>dcl1&#x02013;7</italic> phenotypes by the <italic>arf8</italic> mutation echoes previous findings that most developmental abnormalities of mutant plants deficient for <italic>SERRATE</italic> (a gene involved in maturation of some, albeit not all Arabidopsis miRNAs) can be rescued by mutations in only two targets of miR-165/miR-166, PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA, which encode HD-ZIPII transcription factors specifying adaxial cell fates <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Grigg1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Thus, the establishment of key developmental programs might require the action of only a small subset of miRNAs and of their targets in Arabidopsis, raising the important issue of the biological significance of additional targets predicted for these and other miRNAs. An in-depth meta-analysis of the transcriptome and protein outputs of over-expressed miRNAs in various mammalian cell cultures similarly raised the question of whether metazoan miRNA-directed regulation of most predicted targets might be biologically neutral <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Seitz1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. While the neutrality hypothesis certainly deserves attention in plants, an alternative idea holds that many plant miRNAs (and thus their targets) might mainly confer robustness to redundant, miRNA-independent gene repression programs based on transcriptional or epigenetic control, for instance. According to this idea, the function of such miRNAs would only become apparent under at least two conditions. The first condition would entail the prior genetic ablation of the redundant layers of gene expression control <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Ambros1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The second circumstance that might reveal functions of plant miRNAs in safeguarding unwanted gene expression is stress. Indeed, most miRNA studies in Arabidopsis have been conducted so far under ideal laboratory growth conditions, where the environmental cues or stimuli that might be required to induce unstable transcriptional patterns are usually nonexistent. Stress application and genetic inactivation of major transcriptional/epigenetic &#x02018;hubs&#x02019; in VSR plants, miRNA pathway mutants, or individual <italic>MIRNA</italic> gene knockouts, are thus attractive prospects in future studies of Arabidopsis small RNAs and of their targets.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>VSRs, post-transcriptional gene silencing and viral disease symptoms</title><p>One important aspect that had remained unclear from previous studies of antiviral silencing is whether hindrance of the host miRNA pathway is actually a mere consequence of the primary inhibition of antiviral silencing by VSRs or, on the contrary, a deliberate attempt of plant viruses to perturb plant developmental or hormonal pathways to optimize their replication and/or spread. This question is of particular pertinence in the frame of auxin signaling (which is modulated by ARF8), as this hormone has been previously implicated as a negative regulator of basal defense in plants <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Navarro1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Moreover, the interaction of the <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV) replicase protein, which displays VSR activities, with the PAP1 Aux/IAA protein correlated with viral disease symptoms <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Padmanabhan1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. The results of TuMV infections in <italic>arf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant Arabidopsis, however, show that neither the virus replication nor the chlorotic symptom intensity was altered in those plants, despite a strong reduction of the developmental anomalies normally linked to the infection. These experiments therefore demonstrate in an authentic infection context, that the onset of morphological symptoms often associated with viral diseases, on the one hand, and pathogen virulence as a consequence of antiviral silencing suppression, on the other, can be uncoupled.</p><p>Given the high evolutionary conservation of ARF8 and of its riboregulator, miR167, the question thus arises of whether leaf serration and flower defects seen in Arabidopsis are an expected, generic outcome of virus infection in other plant species. It might not be the case for at least three reasons. First, miR167 and its targets may not have a similar weight in shaping organ morphology as they do in Arabidopsis, given the differences in stature and physiology of many plants. Second, the contribution of small RNAs to ARF8 regulation, as opposed to transcriptional control programs (as evoked in the previous section), may vary between species. Third, paralogous proteins not necessarily regulated by small RNAs might ensure redundant ARF8 functions in some species. Supporting these ideas, expression of the same or related VSR alleles as those used in the present study induces developmental phenotypes in tobacco that do not necessarily overlap with those seen in Arabidopsis <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Siddiqui1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. A last puzzling observation is that the <italic>arf8</italic> mutation did not suppress the chlorotic symptoms associated with TuMV infection, leaving open the question of whether chlorosis, a widespread yet very poorly understood outcome of virus infection, is indeed related to virulence through VSR function. Accumulation of VSR-deficient viruses, including HcPro-deficient TuMV, can be rescued in Arabidopsis <italic>dcl2-dcl4</italic> double-mutants. Thus, incorporating the <italic>arf8</italic> mutation in this background might provide an interesting ground to study the potential VSR-dependency of chlorosis without the complication of developmental symptoms caused by viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>P15, P19 and HcPro expressing lines (in the <italic>CHS</italic> RNAi background) were described previously <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Dunoyer2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, as were the P6 transgenic line in the WT background <xref rid="ppat.1002035-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.
