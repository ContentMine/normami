Within the shoot apical meristem, auxin accumulates in a graded and dynamic manner with sites of auxin maxima correlating with the sites of lateral organ initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The formation of auxin gradients within the meristem appears to result primarily from directional transport of the hormone and local biosynthesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Directional transport is mediated by PINFORMED (PIN) proteins, which act as auxin efflux carriers and exhibit polarized plasma membrane localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>PIN1 </italic>result in inflorescences that do not initiate floral meristems and instead grow as pin-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This phenotype can be rescued by application of auxin to the meristem, demonstrating the importance of auxin to floral meristem initiation and the pivotal role that <italic>PIN1 </italic>plays in the generation of auxin gradients within the meristem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These conclusions are also supported by studies showing that wild-type plants grown in the presence of the auxin transport inhibitor <italic>N</italic>-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) phenocopy <italic>pin1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In addition to regulating floral meristem outgrowth, auxin also regulates floral organ development. Disruptions in polar auxin transport via transient NPA application result in flowers with reduced numbers of floral organs, narrower sepals and petals, malformed anthers and gynoecium with altered patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These alterations in gynoecium patterning are very similar to those resulting from mutations in <italic>ETTIN </italic>(<italic>ETT</italic>), which encodes an auxin response factor (ARF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>PIN1 </italic>or <italic>PINOID </italic>(<italic>PID</italic>), which encodes a Ser-Thr kinase that controls PIN1 polarity, can produce several abnormal flowers prior to inflorescence termination in a pin-like structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These flowers exhibit a range of defects that can include alterations in organ number (typically fewer sepals and stamens and more petals), fusion of floral organs, and valveless gynoecia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Disruptions in flower development have also been observed in plants defective in auxin biosynthesis. Biosynthesis of the major auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), involves both tryptophan (Trp)-dependent and Trp-independent pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Mutations in multiple members of the <italic>YUCCA </italic>(<italic>YUC</italic>) family of flavin monooxygenases, which act in the tryptamine (TAM) Trp-dependent pathway, display reductions in floral organ number, altered organ morphology, valveless gynoecia and sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similar phenotypes are observed in plants mutant for tryptophan aminotransferase <italic>TAA1 </italic>and the related <italic>TAR2 </italic>gene, which act in the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) Trp-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which auxin regulates floral meristem outgrowth and organogenesis within the flower are not well defined. Real time imaging of inflorescence meristems has demonstrated that PIN1 upregulation in floral anlagen is correlated with downregulation of the meristem regulator SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) as well as the boundary protein CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 2 (CUC2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two genes that are likely to promote floral meristem initiation and specification downstream of auxin are the growth-promoting gene <italic>ANT </italic>and the floral meristem identity gene <italic>LEAFY </italic>(<italic>LFY</italic>). These two genes are early markers of a floral meristem fate and their expression is altered in <italic>pin1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, exposure of wild-type inflorescences to NPA results in a decrease in <italic>ANT </italic>mRNA accumulation in floral anlagen as early as 24 hours after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These data are consistent with a model in which auxin accumulation upregulates <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>LFY </italic>expression to promote primordium outgrowth and floral identity, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However <italic>ant </italic>mutants do not display any defects in floral meristem initiation. Thus either <italic>ANT </italic>does not play a role in floral meristem initiation or it acts in parallel with other genes to promote primordium outgrowth.</p><p>Besides its proposed role in floral meristem initiation, <italic>ANT </italic>regulates floral meristem patterning, specification of floral organ identity, growth of floral organs and gynoecium patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In two of these processes (lateral organ growth and gynoecium patterning) <italic>ANT </italic>function been linked directly to auxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. <italic>ANT </italic>promotes growth downstream of the auxin-inducible gene <italic>ARGOS </italic>(<underline>a</underline>uxin-<underline>r</underline>egulated <underline>g</underline>ene involved in <underline>o</underline>rgan <underline>s</underline>ize), while in maturing organs <italic>ANT </italic>expression is repressed by <italic>ARF2</italic>, a repressor of organ growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the gynoecium, <italic>ANT </italic>acts together with <italic>REVOLUTA </italic>and polar auxin transport to specify development of the carpel medial domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In several of its roles in flower development, <italic>ANT </italic>acts in a partially redundant manner with the related <italic>AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE6 </italic>(<italic>AIL6</italic>). While <italic>ail6 </italic>flowers have a wild-type appearance, <italic>ant ail6 </italic>flowers have more severe defects than <italic>ant. ant ail6 </italic>flowers lack petals, stamens and normal gynoecium, are dramatically reduced in size, and exhibit defects in floral organ positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Altered expression of the auxin-responsive reporter <italic>AGH3-2:GUS </italic>in <italic>ant ail6 </italic>inflorescence meristems and flowers suggests that these floral defects may be a consequence of altered patterns of auxin accumulation and/or responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition to floral defects, <italic>ant ail6 </italic>plants exhibit decreased apical dominance, reduced stature, and altered vascular patterning, phenotypes similar to those found in plants disrupted in auxin physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Like <italic>ANT</italic>, <italic>AIL6 </italic>expression is upregulated in incipient lateral organ primordia. This suggests that <italic>AIL6 </italic>might act redundantly with <italic>ANT </italic>in floral meristem initiation, but <italic>ant ail6 </italic>double mutants are still able to initiate floral meristems. <italic>ant ail6 </italic>inflorescence meristems do eventually stop initiating flowers, but this is due to a general growth arrest of the entire inflorescence apex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] rather than specific termination of floral meristem initiation with continued growth of the inflorescence apex as is observed in <italic>pin1 </italic>mutants. Thus, it is still not known whether <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>regulate floral meristem initiation.</p><p>To further probe the roles of <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>in floral development processes potentially regulated by auxin, I have examined the consequences of losing <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>function singly or together in plants compromised for auxin transport via genetic or pharmacological means. These experiments demonstrate that both mutants are sensitized to defects in auxin transport, consistent with a role for these genes in regulation of some aspect of auxin physiology during flower development. The phenotypic consequences of loss of <italic>ANT </italic>function and loss of <italic>AIL6 </italic>function under the same conditions are somewhat different, suggesting that these two genes make distinct contributions to early stages of flower development. Floral meristem initiation is completely suppressed in plants compromised in polar auxin transport and containing mutations in both <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6</italic>, demonstrating that these two genes do function in the initiation of floral meristems from the inflorescence meristem.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><sec><title>Mutations in <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>enhance the floral initiation and floral patterning defects of <italic>pid </italic>mutants</title><p>Because <italic>pid </italic>mutants make several flowers prior to termination of the inflorescence meristem, they provide a sensitized background in which to study the role of <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>in auxin-mediated floral meristem initiation.

To further characterize the second whorl organs that develop in these NPA-treated <italic>ant-4 </italic>flowers, SEM was used to examine their epidermal surface morphologies.

Epidermal cells of thin petals did show cuticular thickenings characteristic of petals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). However, these organs often lacked the conical cells normally present on the adaxial surface of petals, suggesting that these organs, like the filaments, had disruptions in organ polarity.

The results presented here provide the first evidence that <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>are important factors regulating floral meristem initiation. Combining either <italic>ant </italic>or <italic>ail6 </italic>with <italic>pid </italic>reduces the number of flowers initiated by the inflorescence meristem, while the loss of both <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>function together prevents the formation of any flowers in <italic>pid </italic>mutants. These results suggest that <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>act in a redundant fashion to promote floral meristem initiation. Other pieces of evidence however suggest that the activities of these two genes are not completely overlapping and that <italic>AIL6 </italic>may play a more important role in this process as compared with <italic>ANT</italic>. Floral meristem initiation was temporarily terminated in <italic>ail6-2 </italic>inflorescences treated with 10 &#x003bc;M NPA but not in L<italic>er </italic>or <italic>ant-4 </italic>inflorescences similarly treated. Thus floral meristem initiation is inhibited by lower levels of NPA in <italic>ail6-2 </italic>inflorescences. Furthermore, loss of <italic>AIL6 </italic>function in the <italic>pin1-</italic>3 background results in a nearly complete loss of lateral branches from inflorescences.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>act with polar auxin transport in floral meristem patterning</title><p>One defect in flower development observed in mutants with disruptions in polar auxin transport such as <italic>pid </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or in wild-type plants treated with NPA was fusion of floral organs. This may be a consequence of alterations in the positioning or outgrowth of organ primordia from the floral meristem and/or the inability to establish boundaries between adjacent organs. It is known that polar auxin transport is critical to cotyledon boundary formation during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In postembryonic development, separation between lateral organs and the meristems from which they arise is also likely to involve polar auxin transport (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Live imaging of inflorescence meristem shows that upregulation of PIN1 expression in lateral organ founder cells was correlated with reduced expression of meristem and boundary markers such as STM and CUC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Correspondingly, boundary genes such as <italic>JAGGED LATERAL ORGAN </italic>(<italic>JLO</italic>) appear to repress <italic>PIN1 </italic>and promote <italic>STM </italic>expression in boundary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These antagonistic relationships result in the separation of indeterminate cells within the meristem and determinate cells within the lateral organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The results presented here showing floral organ fusion in some NPA treated wild-type flowers suggest that a common mechanisms is involved in organ separation in shoot apical meristems and floral meristems. Sepal fusion was enhanced in <italic>pid-1 ail6-2 </italic>flowers compared to <italic>pid-1 </italic>flowers and in NPA treated <italic>ant-4 </italic>and <italic>ail6-2 </italic>flowers as compared with NPA treated L<italic>er </italic>flowers. Thus, <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>appear to function together with polar auxin transport in separation of sepals, while <italic>ANT </italic>also acts in stamen boundary specification. These data provide a link between auxin and the role of <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>in floral meristem patterning.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ANT </italic>promotes petal development in combination with auxin transport</title><p><italic>ant-4 </italic>mutants in which polar auxin transport was reduced also exhibited severe effects on petal development. Few petals were initiated in <italic>pid ant-4 </italic>double mutants or in the later-arising NPA-treated <italic>ant-4 </italic>flowers. The distinct temporal effects observed after NPA treatment on <italic>ant-4 </italic>flowers were likely a consequence of the floral development stage at which auxin transport was inhibited. Flowers maturing 10-12 days after NPA treatment presumably correspond to those in which sepal and petal primordia were already initiated while flowers maturing 13-15 days after NPA treatment most likely correspond to younger floral meristems in which sepal and petal primordia had not yet initiated. In L<italic>er </italic>plants, the length of time between floral meristem initiation and flower opening is approximately 13.25 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the earliest flowers affected by NPA treatment, second whorl organs were present but often developed as filaments or very thin petals. The lack of petal blade outgrowth and the absence of conical cells in thin petals indicate that petal polarity is disrupted. A role for auxin in mediating adaxial/abaxial patterning during organogenesis has been suggested by the phenotype of plants lacking two related ARFs, ETT and ARF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <italic>ett arf4 </italic>double mutants have defects in lateral organ polarity that mimic loss of function mutations in <italic>KANADI </italic>genes that specify abaxial identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In later-arising NPA-treated <italic>ant-4 </italic>flowers, second whorl organs were usually missing suggesting that polar auxin transport is required for petal initiation. It is not clear why petal initiation is particularly sensitive to NPA treatment in the <italic>ant-4 </italic>background.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here I show that combining mutations in <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>with disruptions in polar auxin transport results in severe effects on shoot and flower development. <italic>ANT </italic>and <italic>AIL6 </italic>appear to have both overlapping and distinct roles in the process of floral meristem initiation downstream of auxin, while <italic>ANT </italic>appears to play a more important role than <italic>AIL6 </italic>in later stages of auxin-mediated floral meristem patterning and floral organogenesis. The results are consistent with a model in which <italic>ant </italic>and <italic>ail6 </italic>mutants are disrupted in some aspect of auxin physiology. Furthermore they support the idea that all of the different functions of these two genes are linked with auxin dynamics within shoot tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>ecotype Landsberg <italic>erecta </italic>(L<italic>er</italic>) was used as the wild type.
