To cope with these environmental stressors, plant cells have developed coordinated and integrated molecular networks for stress signal perception, transduction and adaptation mechanisms under adverse conditions of growth. In general, some adaptive cellular responses to a specific stress condition are interconnected with other environmental responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For instance, conditions of water stress result in both nutritional and osmotic stress, which can also be caused by salt stress. Similarly, increasing evidence in the literature has demonstrated the interconnection among the responses to pathogen attack and developmental signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this complex interplay of physiological stresses, plant cells have evolved both anterograde and retrograde transduction pathways among the organelles to respond to environmental signals in an integrated and coordinated manner. One such major signaling organelle is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which integrates a variety of responses against stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The ER is a multifunctional organelle that supports a series of basic cellular processes, such as protein folding and quality control, the maintenance of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>balance and lipid biosynthesis. Any condition that disturbs ER homeostasis and ER function can induce stress in the organelle. In general, ER stress is initiated by an imbalance between the rate of protein synthesis and ER protein-processing activities. Under conditions in which the nascent, unfolded polypeptide influx into the lumen of the ER exceeds the folding and processing capacity of the organelle, unfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER and, in turn, trigger a cytoprotective pathway designated 'the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has been described in details in mammalian cells [for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]]. To alleviate ER stress, the coordinated action of three UPR transducers, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), the inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), leads to the activation of the following three types of cellular response: (1) the up-regulation of ER molecular chaperones, such as BiP (binding protein) and calnexin (CNX); (2) the attenuation of protein translation that is mediated by PERK through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#x003b1; (eIF2&#x003b1;); and (3) the degradation of misfolded proteins by a process called 'ER-associated degradation' (ERAD). However, excessive or prolonged stress can lead to maladaptive responses and, ultimately, can activate apoptotic cell death to protect tissues from necrotic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that ER stress can also elicit an innate immunity defense to protect tissues in mammalian cells, and in plant cells, ER stress is linked to the host defense response to microbial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, in addition to the UPR, other signaling pathways radiate from the ER to the mitochondria, nucleus and possibly other organelles.</p><p>Recently, a global expression profiling on tunicamycin-induced and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced soybean leaves uncovered an ER stress- and osmotic stress-shared response represented by co-regulated genes that was found to be synergistically induced by both stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Genes in this integrated pathway encode proteins with diverse roles, such as plant-specific development and cell death (DCD) domain-containing proteins, represented by the asparagine-rich proteins NRP-A and NRP-B, an ubiquitin-associated (UBA) protein homolog and NAC (<italic><underline>N</underline>AM, <underline>A</underline>TAF1, ATAF2 </italic>and <italic><underline>C</underline>UC2</italic>) domain-containing proteins. NAC proteins are plant specific transcriptional factors that are involved in a variety of developmental events as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses [for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]]. They comprise a large family of transcriptional regulator genes and, in the soybean genome, are represented by at least 101 sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The N-rich protein (<italic>NRP</italic>) genes, which demonstrated the strongest synergistic induction, share a highly conserved C-terminal DCD domain in addition to a high content of asparagine residues at their more divergent N termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This structural organization places NRP-A and NRP-B in the subgroup I of plant-specific DCD-containing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated that both NRP-A and NRP-B induce a senescence-like response when ectopically expressed in soybean cells and tobacco leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These studies have demonstrated that ER stress and osmotic stress pathways converge at the level of NRP gene activation to potentiate a cell death response. In fact, the combination of both stress signals intensifies the output of the different pathways upon NRP expression; therefore, NRPs serve as molecular links that integrate the ER stress and osmotic stress responses. This ER stress- and osmotic stress-integrating response has been designated as the NRP-mediated cell death signaling, which is synergistically activated by both stress signals. We have recently demonstrated that the transcriptional factor GmERD15 acts upstream of NRPs and activates the expression of NRP-A and NRP-B in response to osmotic stress and ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although the integrated signaling pathway has the potential to accommodate general plant-specific adaptive responses, mechanistic knowledge of the pathway is lacking, and downstream components have yet to be identified. Here, we describe a member of the NAC domain-containing protein superfamily from soybean, GmNAC6 (<italic>Glycine max </italic>NAC6) as a possible downstream component of the pathway. In addition to being synergistically up-regulated by a combination of ER stress and osmotic stress signals, ectopic expression of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>causes senescence-like responses <italic>in planta</italic>, a phenotype that resembles the NRP-mediated response. We also found that NRPs induce promoter activation and expression of GmNAC6 genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GmNAC6 is induced by ER stress and osmotic stress individually but requires both signals for full activation</title><p>To identify components of the ER stress- and osmotic stress-integrating NRP-mediated cell-death response, we searched among the co-regulated genes by both stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] for those that were synergistically induced by both stress signals. In this regard, we focused our attention on an EST encoding a member of the NAC domain-containing protein family and extended our search to other members of the soybean NAC protein family. At least three members of the NAC domain-containing protein family from soybean --GmNAC1, GmNAC5 and GmNAC6-- have been associated with senescence or cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, only GmNAC6 was induced by the osmotic stress inducer, PEG, and the ER stress-inducing agents, tunicamycin (TUN) and L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC), which cause protein misfolding in the ER by different mechanisms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). ER stress (<italic>BiPD </italic>and <italic>CNX</italic>) and osmotic stress (<italic>SMP</italic>) marker genes were included in the assay to ensure the efficiency of the tunicamycin and PEG treatments. The combination of ER stress and osmotic stress promoted a slightly more than additive effect on the accumulation of GmNAC6 transcripts in a fashion similar to the induction of the NRP-A and NRP-B genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results indicate that the integration of ER-stress and osmotic-stress signals leads to the full activation of GmNAC6.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The integration of ER-stress and osmotic-stress signals leads to full activation of GmNAC6</bold>.

The combined exposure of soybean seedlings to both stress inducers, however, did not promote an additive or synergistic effect on the induction of GmNAC3. Taken together, these results substantiate the argument that GmNAC6, but not GmNAC3, may be a target of the NRP-mediated cell death signaling that integrates ER stress and osmotic stress responses.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>GmNAC6 </italic>promotes cell death in tobacco leaves and in soybean cells</title><p>We have recently demonstrated that the integrated pathway transduces a programmed cell death (PCD) signal generated by ER- and osmotic-stresses that results in the appearance of markers associated with leaf senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To assess whether GmNA6 is involved in cell death, we assayed for hallmarks of leaf senescence, such as chlorotic lesions, chlorophyll loss, lipid peroxidation and the induction of senescence-associated genes in tobacco leaf sectors infiltrated with Agrobacterium carrying a 35S::GmNAC6 construct. After five days post-infiltration, the leaf sectors expressing <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>displayed a chlorotic phenotype with necrotic lesions that rapidly evolved to intense necrosis at seven days post-infiltration as a result of massive cell death; this observation was in marked contrast with the expression of an unrelated <italic>NIG </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] used as a negative control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

In fact, under similar conditions, the symptoms induced by NRP-B expression were first visible at 8 days post-Agro-infiltration when an increase in membrane ion leakage of the NRP-B Agroinfiltrated leaves was also observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>GmNAC6 promotes cell death <italic>in planta</italic></bold>.

The latter was examined by measuring the accumulation of thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive compounds, which was clearly enhanced in the 35S::<italic>GmNAC6 </italic>Agro-inoculated leave sectors, when compared with the leaf slices that were Agro-inoculated with the control <italic>35S::NIG </italic>gene. These TBA-reactive compounds are products of senescence-associated lipid peroxidation, a process that results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chlorophyll loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We further confirmed the GmNAC6-induced senescence-like phenotype by monitoring the expression of the senescence-associated gene markers, <italic>NTCP-23 </italic>(AB032168, called CP1 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which has been shown to be up-regulated in association with tobacco leaf senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the pathogenesis-related gene 1 [<italic>PR1</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]], by quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of GmNAC6 promoted an enhanced accumulation of NTCP-23 and PR1 transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). GmNAC1, which has also been shown to be associated with senescence in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], induced the expression of <italic>NPCP-23 </italic>and, to a much lesser extent, <italic>PR1 </italic>when transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, demonstrating the effectiveness of the assay in this heterologous system. Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>expression induces a senescence-like response in tobacco leaves.</p><p>Because NRPs, effectors of the ER stress and osmotic stress-integrating cell death response, have also been shown to induce cell death when transiently expressed in soybean cells, we examined whether GmNAC6 could induce the activity of caspase 3-like and DNA fragmentation in the endogenous system. The transient expression of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>was driven by the 35S promoter in soybean protoplasts and was measured by RT-PCR, relative to a helicase marker to control for any variation in the transformation efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The caspase 3-like activity in total protein extracts from GmNAC6-overexpressing soybean cells was 3.62-fold higher than in extracts from protoplasts transformed with the empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We also used the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique to measure fragmentation of DNA in individual cells 36 hours post electroporation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). After TUNEL labeling, the fomaldehyde-fixed and permeabilized semi-protoplasted leaf cells were also counterstained with propidium iodide (PI). Under these conditions, PI stained all cells and the red fluorescence signal concentrates in the nucleus as we treated the samples with RNase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,</xref> empty vector, see arrows). The nuclei of control cells transformed with the empty vector fluoresced intensely with propidium iodide (PI, red) and exhibited only TUNEL-negative nuclei (panel empty vector). In contrast, the <italic>GmNAC6</italic>-expressing samples had TUNEL positive nuclei that showed the same extent of staining as <italic>NRP-B </italic>(data not shown) and DNase treated positive controls. Merged is an overlay of the fluorescent image of TUNEL labeling with PI staining cells to facilitate the identification of TUNEL-positive nuclei. From two independent experiments, approximately 21% &#x000b1; 1.5 of the semi-protoplasted leaf cells transformed with 35S::GmNAC6 had TUNEL- positive nuclei. Very likely the low efficiency of protoplasts transformation may account for the relatively low percentage of TUNEL positive nuclei in protoplasts electroporated with 35S::GmNAC6. Because caspase 3-like activity and DNA fragmentation have been described as biochemical markers associated with programmed cell death in soybean suspension cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], our results are consistent with an involvement of GmNAC6 in cell death events.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The transient expression of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>in leaf soybean protoplasts induces cell death</bold>.

In fact, osmotic stress also activates the transduction of a cell death signal through NRPs. The convergence of both stress signals on NRP expression in a synergistic manner allows the transfer of information between these two distinct stress response pathways to potentiate a cell death response. Therefore, the integration of the ER stress and osmotic stress signals into a circuit of cell death occurs through the activation of NRP-mediated signaling. This cell death integrated pathway has emerged as a relevant adaptive response of plant cells to multiple environmental stimuli. Nevertheless, knowledge about this signaling pathway is limited to the identification of NRP as a crucial mediator of the cell death response and GmERD15 as a transcriptional factor that activates NRPs expression. Here, we describe a member of the NAC domain-containing protein family from soybean, GmNAC6, that may act downstream of NRP-A or NRP-B in the integration of the ER-stress and osmotic-stress cell death signals. GmNAC6 was linked to NRP-mediated cell death signaling based on three criteria. First, we showed that GmNAC6 expression was up-regulated by ER stress and osmotic stress individually, but when combined, the two stress signals promoted a synergistic accumulation of GmNAC6 transcripts. The synergistic induction of gene expression by the combination of ER stress and osmotic stress inducers is one of the criteria that link target genes to the ER stress- and osmotic stress-integrating pathway. Second, similar to the NRPs, the transient expression of GmNAC6 induced a senescence-like response in tobacco leaves and a cell death response in soybean cells. Lastly, the ectopic expression of <italic>NRP-A </italic>and <italic>NRP-B </italic>in soybean cells promoted the activation of the GmNAC6 promoter and the induction of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>expression. Collectively, these results position GmNAC6 downstream of the NRPs in the ER stress- and osmotic stress-integrating pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). However, whether GmNAC6 is linearly coupled to the NRPs in the integrated pathway is still a matter of debate.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The osmotic-stress and ER-stress signal-integrating pathway</bold>. ER stress and osmotic stress activate two independent signaling pathways (1 and 2), which converge on NRP-A and NRP-B expression to activate an osmotic- and ER-stress integrating pathway, also called the integrated pathway. The enhanced accumulation of membrane-associated NRPs activates a cascade to induce the expression of the nuclear transactivator, NAC6, which, in turn, promotes cell death.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-11-129-7"/></fig><p>NRPs and GmNAC6 were also induced by biotic signals, such as incompatible interactions and CDE treatment, but with different kinetics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). While NRPs were rapidly induced by both treatments, increased accumulation of GmNAC6 transcritps occurred with a delayed kinetics. These data were consistent with the delayed induction of GmNAC6 during protoplast preparation, which generates similar signal as the CDE treatment. Therefore, an increased accumulation of NRP-B transcripts preceded the induction of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>expression, which supports the argument that GmNAC6 acts downstream of NRPs. This interpretation is further substantiated by the observation that, in our experimental tobacco leaf transient expression system, GmNAC6-induced cell death occurred more rapidly than NRP-mediated cell death, as it would be expected from effectors acting downstream of NRPs in the cell death signaling pathway.</p><p>We found that NRP-B in soybean protoplasts induced <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>expression and activated GmNAC6 promoter. Whether the NRP-mediated up-regulation of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>expression is a direct result of NRPs transactivation of gene expression or a secondary effect of signal transduction mediated by NRP it remains to be determined. Our data favor the latter hypothesis, as we have previously shown that soybean NRPs are localized in the cytoplasm in association with the plasma membrane (13). The Arabidopsis NRP homolog is also a cytosolic protein, but is translocated to the mitochondria under stresses conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We don't know whether the soybean NRPs also share a stress-mediated mitochondrial compartmentalization, but we have failed to demonstrate a nuclear localization of NRP-B as it would be expected for a transcriptional activation function. Sequence analysis of 1-kb 5'flanking sequences of <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>revealed some conserved motifs of most eukaryotic promoters, such as a TATA box (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> in pink) and an inverted CCAAT box (in bold), in addition to several potential regulatory elements of plant promoters, potentially involved in response to events of cell death or to osmotic stress and drought. These include an ABA-responsive element, the motif III of rice RAB16b gene1 (in purple), a binding site (in green) of OsBIHD1, a rice BELL homeodomain transcription factor involved in disease resistance, four putative elements (NGATT, in red) for the cytokinin-regulated transcription factor ARR1 and two binding sites (in blue) found in the ERD1 gene, involved in response to dehydration stress and dark-induced senescence. These putative cis-regulatory elements on the GmNAC6 promoter illustrate potential sites for assembly of transcription factors, which might constitute targets of the NRP-mediated stress-induced cell death response.</p><p>The evidence that <italic>NRPs </italic>and <italic>GmNAC6 </italic>were also induced by biotic signals implies that the NRP-mediated cell death signaling is a general adaptive response of plants. The protective role of the induction of PCD by pathogens during incompatible interactions, a phenomenon well documented in plants, restricts the pathogenic attack to the inoculated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The rapid induction of <italic>NRP </italic>genes by incompatible interactions indicates that the NRP-mediated induction of PCD may be part of the hypersensitive response. Consistent with this hypothesis, the transient expression of GmNAC6 in tobacco leaves promoted the induction of the pathogenesis-related gene 1, PR1 and caused necrotic lesions.</p><p>In addition to being induced by ER stress and osmotic stress, NRP-mediated signaling is also induced by drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These abiotic stress signals induce a shared cell death response through NRPs. While the ER stress branch of the response is distinct from the molecular chaperone-induced branch of UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we previously showed that the osmotic stress branch of the response may be acid abscisic (ABA)-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In fact, both NRP-B and GmNAC6 are induced by ABA. Furthermore, evidence in the literature has demonstrated an antagonistic effect of ABA on salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defense pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, it may be possible that the activation of NRP-mediated signaling leads to enhanced SA-mediated responses, as shown by the induction of <italic>PR1 </italic>and hypersensitive response-like phenotypes, and acts antagonistically to suppress ABA-mediated responses. As ABA is a central regulator of plant adaptation to drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and plays a crucial role in the regulation of transpirational water loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it would be interesting to investigate whether an inactivation of the NRP-mediated cell death response would promote tolerance to dehydration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that the integration of the ER stress and osmotic stress signals into a circuit of cell death occurs through the activation of NRP-mediated signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
