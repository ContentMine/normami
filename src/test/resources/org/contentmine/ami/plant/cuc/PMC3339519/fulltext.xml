Nevertheless, it is an extremely cold-sensitive tropical species. Thus far, there is limited information about gene regulation and signalling pathways related to the cold stress response in cassava. The development of microarray technology has accelerated the study of global transcription profiling under certain conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray representing 20,840 genes was used to perform transcriptome profiling in apical shoots of cassava subjected to cold at 7&#x000b0;C for 0, 4 and 9 h. A total of 508 transcripts were identified as early cold-responsive genes in which 319 sequences had functional descriptions when aligned with <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>proteins. Gene ontology annotation analysis identified many cold-relevant categories, including 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus', 'Response to stress', 'Transcription factor activity', and 'Chloroplast'. Various stress-associated genes with a wide range of biological functions were found, such as signal transduction components (e.g., MAP kinase 4), transcription factors (TFs, e.g., <italic>RAP2.11</italic>), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes (e.g., catalase 2), as well as photosynthesis-related genes (e.g., <italic>PsaL</italic>). Seventeen major TF families including many well-studied members (e.g., AP2-EREBP) were also involved in the early response to cold stress. Meanwhile, KEGG pathway analysis uncovered many important pathways, such as 'Plant hormone signal transduction' and 'Starch and sucrose metabolism'. Furthermore, the expression changes of 32 genes under cold and other abiotic stress conditions were validated by real-time RT-PCR. Importantly, most of the tested stress-responsive genes were primarily expressed in mature leaves, stem cambia, and fibrous roots rather than apical buds and young leaves. As a response to cold stress in cassava, an increase in transcripts and enzyme activities of ROS scavenging genes and the accumulation of total soluble sugars (including sucrose and glucose) were also detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The dynamic expression changes reflect the integrative controlling and transcriptome regulation of the networks in the cold stress response of cassava. The biological processes involved in the signal perception and physiological response might shed light on the molecular mechanisms related to cold tolerance in tropical plants and provide useful candidate genes for genetic improvement.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cassava (<italic>Manihot esculenta </italic>Crantz) is widely cultivated for its starchy storage roots and is a staple food and animal feed in tropical and sub-tropical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is also considered to be an important source of modified starches and bioethanol in China and other Southeast Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, as a tropical root crop, cassava is native to a warm habitat and is categorized as a cold-sensitive species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, low temperatures and frozen conditions are the most important limiting factors for its geographical location and productivity. In the subtropics, where unpredictable cold weather occurs occasionally, it is important to protect the storage roots and propagation stems from chilling stress. For example, the unprecedented freezing disaster occurred in Southern China in January 2008 caused great damage to cassava stem seeds and led to yield reduction in Guangxi, Guangdong and other provinces, resulting in a loss of a billion Chinese Yuan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, to ensure a prolonged growth period (i.e., early planting and late harvesting) in the high latitude regions, novel cassava cultivars with improved cold tolerance are in demand.</p><p>Under low temperature below 10&#x000b0;C, many species of tropical or subtropical origin are typically injured or killed and show various symptoms of chilling injury due to the inability to adapt to non-freezing low temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For example, cassava exhibits obvious symptoms of damage at these temperatures, including delayed sprouting of the stem cutting, yield decrease, reduced leaf expansion, chlorosis and even necrosis in its leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Low temperatures have also been recognized as an important facilitator of decreases in nutrient absorption rates (e.g., Boron), reductions in the leaf photosynthetic rate, and the inhibition of plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, the physiological status of cold-stressed plants is also altered, such as transient increases in hormone levels (e.g., ABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and changes in membrane lipid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as soluble sugars, betaine, and proline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and increases in the level of antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] are also occurred. In contrast, temperate plants can withstand freezing temperatures following a period of low, but non-freezing, temperatures, a process called cold acclimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mechanisms of cold acclimation have been extensively investigated in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], as well as in other important crop species such as maize and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The most extensively studied mechanism involves a class of ethylene response factors (ERFs) known as the dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins/C-repeat-binding factors (DREBs/CBFs). They interact with the dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat element (DRE/CRT) in the promoters of their downstream target genes to execute a highly coordinated transcriptional response to low temperature signals. Overall, less information is available for tropical plants (e.g., cassava). Therefore, it would be important to increase our understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics that are associated with cold stress in tropical cassava, especially during the early stages. Moreover, the function of homologous genes in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>could be used to predict the function of cassava genes which may share the same biological functions or common regulatory scenarios among different plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>With the development of molecular technologies and 'omics' tools, microarray studies have become a useful strategy for the global analysis of plant gene expression. Using cDNA microarrays or whole genome arrays, the abiotic stress responses of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and other plants have been widely analyzed. For examples, the expression patterns of genes were identified in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and rice under conditions of drought, cold, high-salinity or abscisic acid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The transcriptomic identification of candidate genes involved in sunflower responses to chilling and salt stresses has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The long-oligonucleotide microarray, which has many advantages compared to other microarray technologies, reliably detects transcript ratios even at one copy per cell in complicated biological samples, and could distinguish different members of gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, it is appropriate to explore the early cold stress responsive genes of cassava using a 60-mer long-oligonucleotide microarray approach.</p><p>Thus far, several studies have been reported in cassava using genomic tools for developing new knowledge and technologies. For instance, EST and cDNA libraries have been constructed in cassava for the identification of starch biosynthesis and biotic/abiotic-responsive genes or genes corresponding to the different developmental stages of various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Studies using cassava cDNA microarrays to analyze gene expression in cassava plants subjected to post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD) or <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis </italic>infection have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, gene expression profiling related to the different growth stages of cassava storage roots was recently conducted using a long-oligonucleotide microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Fortunately, a draft genome sequence for cassava has been released and recently updated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/cassava">http://www.phytozome.net/cassava</ext-link>), which greatly facilitates cassava research worldwide. Nevertheless, comprehensive genome-wide expression profiling data for cassava under cold stress treatment are still lacking, which limits our capacity to decipher the molecular mechanisms related to various stress responses. Additionally, to stabilize cassava yield even under unfavorable growth conditions, it is necessary to study the changes of pan-genome genes or pathways in order to identify key candidates for improving cold tolerance in cassava.</p><p>In this study, a gene expression profiling of apical shoots from cassava subjected to low temperature was conducted using a custom-designed, 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray covering 20,840 cassava transcripts. In total, 508 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and their biological functions were characterized through gene ontology (GO) annotation and KEGG pathway analysis. Our study could increase the understanding of cassava gene regulation under the condition of cold stress and reveal novel approaches to improve cold tolerance through genetic engineering.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Phenotypic and physiological changes of cassava in response to cold</title><p>Cassava is a typical tropical crop adapted to warm climates. Under normal conditions, 3-month-old cassava (TMS60444) plants have vigorous apical buds and fully expanded mature leaves with upward leaf fingers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Left panel). When a low-temperature treatment is applied to cassava at 7&#x000b0;C under weak light for 4 h, the plants displayed visible morphological changes, including weak dehydration and wilting of the apical buds and leaves, especially in the buds, as well as downward leaf fingers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Middle panel). Under prolonged exposure to the stress (9 h), the whole plants exhibited obvious phenotypic damages, including softening and downward bending of the petioles, loss of strength in the immature stems and more severe wilting leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Right panel). Generally, the treated plants could be partially recovered and resumed growth when transferred into normal conditions (data not shown), indicating that the cellular changes caused by a 9 h cold treatment were reversible. Since apical shoots show extremely sensitive response to low temperature (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), the apical shoots (about 4-6 cm) of 3-month-old plants, which were treated for 0, 4 and 9 h, were used as material for microarray hybridization.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic and physiological changes in cold-stressed cassava</bold>.

Bar = 500 nm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-13-64-1"/></fig><p>In addition to morphological changes, a clear impact on ultra-structure of chloroplasts was also observed in leaves of cold-stressed cassava plants. Compared to normal chloroplasts in unstressed leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), the stacking numbers of thylakoids were dramatically reduced and less organized, and the starch granules had almost disappeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The ultra-structural changes in cellular organelles indicate that cold stress might exert an adverse impact on plant growth, causing a reduced photosynthetic rate under the stress.</p><p>Cold stress also leads to obviously physiological changes in cassava. Two stress responsive metabolites, namely malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline, were monitored. MDA is considered to be the final product of lipid peroxidation in the plant cell membrane and is an important indicator of membrane system injuries and cellular metabolism deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has also been reported that MDA contents change during cold stress treatment in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In our experiment, compared to the control level, the MDA concentrations decreased rapidly to 50% after 4 h but increased almost 25% after 9 h; the observed levels had experienced a nearly two-fold change after 24 h of stress treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Decrease in MDA content at 4 h might be due to a transient stress response of cassava to the low temperature shock. But, the prolonged treatment (9 h) finally led to cell damages and MDA accumulation. The accumulation of proline is frequently associated with whole plant tolerance to chilling and other stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Unlike that of MDA, the concentration of proline increased rapidly and achieved nearly a three-fold change after 4 h; it then decreased slightly but remained at a high level until 24 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). These results were consistent with previous studies that proline accumulated in leaves exposure to cold, salt, and other stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and other plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The accumulation of these metabolites is a good indication that the stress-treated plants were actively mounting a stress response during the periods when they were subjected to cold stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray for transcriptomic analysis of low-temperature treated cassava</title><p>To explore the transcriptomic changes of cassava in response to cold stress, a custom long-oligonucleotide (60-mer) microarray generated by the Agilent SurePrint ink-jet technology was applied in the current study. The detailed protocol for designing the cassava microarray has been described by Yang et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] To validate the microarray quality, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each spot was calculated as described by Leiske et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] The average percentages of acceptable spots (SNR &#x0003e; 2.6) and high-quality spots (SNR &#x0003e; 10) were 94.53 &#x000b1; 1.84% and 79.24 &#x000b1; 1.76% in all 9 arrays, which demonstrated the overall reproducibility and high quality of the array. The hierarchical clustering results indicated the clear separation of the samples from different time points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting that the entire experiment from sample collection to data extraction was reproducible and reliable. Five house-keeping genes (beta-actin, c15, EF1a, RuBisCO small chain precursor, and TUB6) were used as the internal controls and their expressions were consistent in the samples at different time points (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), confirming the reliability and accuracy of these microarrays.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression profiling of cold-regulated genes in cassava apical shoots</bold>.

The red numbers are the total numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs); the percentages in parentheses were calculated as the ratio of regulated genes to the total number of cold-regulated genes (508). It should be noted that one gene was up-regulated at 4 h/0 h but down-regulated at 9 h/4 h on our array.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-13-64-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Transcriptomic responses to cold treatment</title><p>Before normalization, the signal intensities of each feature were filtered against negative controls on the array, and 69.87 &#x000b1; 0.72%, 68.14 &#x000b1; 2.59%, and 71.50 &#x000b1; 5.75% of probes on the array were expressed at 0, 4 and 9 h, respectively. Two filtering criteria were used to define differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in our data analysis: a two-fold change in transcript levels among every two time points and a <italic>P </italic>value &#x02264; 0.05. To analyze the similarities and differences among the cold-responsive transcriptomes, a hierarchical clustering was prepared to represent the transcripts of all the differentially expressed probes at the 3 replicates of 0, 4 and 9 h. These results indicated significant differences in the gene expression profiles between the treatments of 9 h and 0 h or 9 h and 4 h, in contrast to the relatively high similarity of the expression profiles between 0 h and 4 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Among the DEGs, 58, 252, and 92 genes were up-regulated and 13, 210, and 36 were down-regulated by analyzing 4 h/0 h, 9 h/0 h, and 9 h/4 h, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Notably, compared to only 71 and 128 genes showed differentially expressed at 4 h/0 h and 9 h/4 h, 474 DEGs were found at 9 h/0 h, suggesting a prolonged stress treatment (9 h) could trigger more stress-related gene expression. Moreover, about 80% of 4 h/0 h and 75% of 9 h/4 h DEGs overlapped with those of 9 h/0 h, which indicated a strong linkage among the 3 stressed comparison points and a progressive biological process.</p><p>In total, 508 DEGs, including 292 cold-inducible and 215 cold-repressed genes, were identified on our array; only one gene (CUST_14887) was up-regulated at 4 h/0 h but down-regulated at 9 h/4 h (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). These represent about 3.5% of the total expressed cassava transcripts on the array. This result indicated that even for tropical crops (e.g., cassava), which have adapted to warm climates, possess a large amount of cold-responsive genes as other temperate plants (e.g., <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>). Therefore, the differences in the ability of tropical species and temperate species to tolerate cold might not totally be due to the amount of genes responsive to cold stress. Instead, we speculate that plants require to timely and coordinately mobilize the biological functions and regulatory networks of stress-responsive genes against stress. Consistent with our observations, a recent study confirmed such scenario even between two close plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Gene ontology clustering of cold-regulated genes</title><p>To explore the biological functions of cold-responsive genes, a total of 20,840 sequences were used as a query to perform an alignment with <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>proteins. Of these, 20,450 sequences had hits with 11,995 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>proteins, and 14,813 (about 71.8%) sequences had hits with 9,158 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>proteins at an E value &#x02264; 1e-5. After searching the descriptions of the 508 DEGs, 319 queries had the highest homologies with annotated proteins according to The <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Information Resource (TAIR), which accounted for 62.8% of the responsive genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). To determine the detailed function of the 319 hits with <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>gene locus identifiers, a GO annotation was performed with the GO terms of TAIR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp">http://www.Arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp</ext-link>), in which 370 GO IDs were hit by 291 gene locus identifiers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Therefore, functional clusters that were classified according to the three components ('Biological Process', 'Molecular Function', and 'Cellular Component') are presented and discussed (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>, respectively). Based on the TAIR percent analysis, the categories of 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'Response to stress', 'Transcription factor activity', and 'Chloroplast' were the major cold-related GO Slims that strongly attracted our attention.</p><sec><title>Cold-responsive genes related to 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'Response to stress'</title><p>In the GO terms of 'Biological Process', the categories of 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'Response to stress', both accounted for 13.36% of the total GOs, were suggested to be the most relevant to cold stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The largest proportions of 'Biological Process' terms were annotated as 'Other cellular processes' (48.09%), 'Other metabolic processes' (43.51%), 'Unknown biological process' (33.59%), and 'Other biological processes' (14.12%), indicating comprehensive changes in cassava gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In addition, 'Protein metabolism' was another noticeable major category (15.27%) supposed to be also involved in the cold stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>TAIR percent of gene ontology (GO) terms for (A) 'Biological Process', (B) 'Molecular Function', and (C) 'Cellular Component' of cold up-regulated and down-regulated genes</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-13-64-3"/></fig><p>There were 34 and 33 genes assigned to the GO terms of 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'Response to stress', respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Because 27 genes were common in both categories, we combined the two categories for analysis and discussion (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Among the overlapping genes, 20 up-regulated genes and 7 down-regulated genes were included. Their encoding proteins cover a wide range of biological functions, including transcription factor (TFs, e.g., AP2 domain transcription factor), protein kinases (e.g., proline extension-like receptor kinase 1), small heat shock proteins (e.g., heat shock protein 18.2), ROS scavenging enzymes [e.g., catalase 2 (<italic>CAT2</italic>)], fatty acid desaturases [e.g., fatty acid biosynthesis 2 (<italic>SSI2</italic>)], signaling molecular proteins (e.g., MAP kinase 4), programmed cell death (PCD)-related gene (e.g., chitinase), and genes involved in the gibberellin acid (GA) and jasmonic acid (JA) metabolism pathway [e.g., gibberellic acid insensitive (<italic>GAI</italic>)]. Among the genes specifically related to the 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus', protein degradation genes (e.g., ubiquitin-protein ligase) and early flowering 4 were up-regulated. Meanwhile, genes involved in ABA signal transduction [e.g., ABA-responsive element binding protein 3 (AREB3)] and disease resistance protein (CC-NBS-LRR), which were down-regulated by cold, were uniquely identified in GO Slim as 'Response to stress' (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Most of these cold-responsive genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated at 9 h/0 h, except 4 genes encoding the calcium ion binding protein (TCH2), ethylene response transcription activator 2 (ERF2), MAP kinase kinase 9, and pseudo-response regulator 5. It is notable that 27 out of these 40 stress-associated genes were up-regulated, indicating that the up-regulation of cold-responsive transcripts by low temperature may play a crucial role in the stress tolerance of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Low temperature responsive transcripts related to

No significant fold changes are indicated by "-".</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Of their homologous genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the MAP kinase 4, beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, <italic>CAT2</italic>, and <italic>TCH2 </italic>were previously reported to be involved in the cold stress response process. For example, MAP kinase 4, which is required for cytokinesis, was implicated in cold and salt stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of VLCFA (very long chain fatty acids), was also responsive to cold and other osmotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. CAT2, a target of plastid, could increase its transcript abundance in response to cold stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. TCH2 has been implicated in calcium signaling in response to diverse stimuli, such as cold, light, pathogens, and touch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, which degrades active GAs, is involved in cold response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and up-regulation of its transcript implied that GA level may be reduced under cold stress. Additionally, calcineurin B-like (CBL)-interacting protein kinase, which has protein serine/threonine kinase activity, has been reported to be involved in the defense response to fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These results revealed that there are considerable conserved and common components in cold stress response mechanisms across plant species, including temperate and tropical plants.</p><p>Besides, a large number of genes with known function were firstly identified in the cold response. The AP2 domain transcription factor (CUST_2332), a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-3 of ERF/AP2 transcription factor family, has been reported involved in response to fungus and chitin in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In this study, the transcript abundance of the AP2 domain transcription factor was up-regulated 16-fold by cold, indicating that it may play a significant role in the regulation of novel signaling pathways to enhance cassava cold tolerance. The expression of a stearoyl-ACP desaturase gene <italic>SSI2</italic>, which involves in fatty acid desaturation, was up-regulated almost 10-fold under cold stress. This change suggested that the gene might be participated in altering membrane lipid composition to enhance membrane fluidity. Maternal effect embryo arrest 14 (<italic>MEE14</italic>), which required for embryonic development ending in seed dormancy, was also highly induced in this study. Interestingly, three transcripts (early flowering 4, gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, and pseudo-response regulator 5) that respond to red or far-red light in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>were cold-inducible, indicating a crosstalk between light signaling and cold stress response.</p><p>In addition, a large number of genes with unknown function were also firstly recorded as cold responsive genes. For instance, four members of MLP-like protein (CUST_6563, CUST_15946, CUST_11303, and CUST_10998) were all up-regulated by 9 h cold treatment. Alpha-crystallin domain 31.2, Bet v I allergen family protein, and homology of yeast autophagy 18 were highly induced more than 5-fold by cold. Two members of RING-H2 finger A2A zinc ion binding proteins were also found to be down-regulated. Taken together, cassava might evolve not only conserved but also specific molecular mechanisms related to stress signaling and response.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factors response to cold stress</title><p>For the 'Molecular Function' GO terms, 'Transferase activity', 'Hydrolase activity', and 'Transcription factor activity' were the three major categories. They accounted for 13.28%, 11.72%, and 11.33% of the total GOs, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Among them, genes associated with 'Transcription factor activity' may be central regulators involved in early cold signal transduction that trigger a cascade of downstream gene expression.</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) play a significant role in plant development and stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To identify the transcription factors involved in the cold stress response, we surveyed the biological functions of putative TFs that were differentially expressed in cassava under the cold treatment. A total of 32 genes were identified as TFs when the 319 identifiers were annotated in TAIR. The number of up-regulated TFs (15) was nearly equal to the number of down-regulated ones (17), suggesting that both transcriptional activation and repression are involved. The <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome has more than 2,657 predicted TFs belonging to 81 gene families in the Plant Transcription Factor Database (PlnTFDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/index.php?sp_id=ATH">http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/index.php?sp_id=ATH</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. According to this classification, 31 cold-responsive transcription factors fell into 17 families, except 1 (CUST_19860) with non-classification (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), and they were annotated with the detailed GO Slims (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, at least five TF families have been reported to be involved in the cold stress response process, including AP2-EREBP

The AP2-EREBP family plays a major role in the early stages of the cold response, as evidenced by many well-characterized DREBs/CBFs cold regulatory pathway. CBF proteins, belonging to A-1 subfamily of ERF/AP2 TF family, are major regulators that function in activating cold-regulated effectors in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and other plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In our study, all members of AP2-EREBP family are grouped to different subfamilies of ERF/AP2 TF family. For instance, <italic>RAP2.11, ERF2</italic>, AP2 domain transcription factor (CUST_20765), and <italic>RAP2.4 </italic>encode members of B-6, B-3, A-5, and A-6 subfamilies of ERF/AP2 TF family, respectively. Some members have been reported to show response to cold stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, such as <italic>RAP2.11 </italic>and <italic>RAP2.4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, others were firstly identified to be involved in cold response, such as AP2 domain TF (CUST_2332) and <italic>ERF2</italic>. Importantly, most members of this family were highly induced at 9 h during cold treatment, which was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), suggesting a relatively delay in triggering transcriptional cascades in the cold response of cassava. Only the ERF9 transcription repressor was down-regulated after 4 h under cold stress. An earlier study had reported that its homologous gene (AT5G44210) of <italic>ERF9 </italic>also experienced a significant decrease in its expression after exposure to heat and freezing in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. One of CBF homologous gene (CUST_6694, hereafter <italic>CBF</italic>-like) was found to be up-regulated following 9 h cold treatment. Due to a high <italic>P </italic>value (0.99), it was excluded from the analysis under our standard (<italic>P </italic>value &#x02264; 0.05). Such scenario indicates that the timely response of DREB/CBF pathway to cold might be variable among different species. Indeed, its cold-induced expression at 9 h following cold treatment, together with most of the AP2-EREBP family factors, was verified by real-time RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>). Therefore, based on our analysis, we speculated that cassava might mount a relatively slow mobilization of stress-related regulators and their downstream genes after exposure to cold, rendering cassava vulnerable to cold stress. Additionally, the transcript of an Inducer of CBF Expression 1 (ICE1)-like gene of cassava was found to be unchanged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and other plants, <italic>ICE</italic>s have been reported to be constitutively expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Expression patterns of important transcripts in response to cold stress at 0, 4, and 9 h by real-time RT-PCR analysis</bold>.

In our study, five MYB or MYB-related family members showed differential expression, with 3 cold-inducible and 2 cold-repressed. Two transcripts, encoding <italic>PCL1 </italic>with a single myb DNA-binding domain, were required for circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and the other three MYB/MYB-related transcription factors were responsive to a diverse of hormone treatments in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Differential expression of MYB TFs implies that other environmental or hormonal pathways may be involved in cold response in cassava. Furthermore, the up-regulation of the CUST_3593 transcript (<italic>PCL1</italic>) was also validated by real-time RT-PCR. Members of the GRAS gene family encode transcriptional regulators that have diverse functions in plant growth and development, such as gibberellin signal transduction, root radial patterning, and axillary meristem formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Although the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome encodes at least 33 GRAS protein family members, few GRAS proteins have been characterized thus far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. It is worth noting that all GRAS family members were down-regulated on the array (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), suggesting that cold stress inhibit plant growth and conserve energy to adapt to the adverse environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Similarly, HSF TFs were reported to be involved in the response to heat and other abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The microarray analysis also showed the inducible expression of heat shock transcription factor A8 and C1 following cold treatment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Interestingly, A8 was also found to be induced in response to low temperatures in potato and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The induction of heat shock TFs and heat shock proteins (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) revealed that cold and heat stresses may share common responsive elements. The majority of WRKY family TFs is known to be responsive to biotic and/or abiotic stress, despite the fact that most research has focused on the role of these genes in plant-pathogen interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. WRKY7, known to encode a novel CaM-binding transcription factor of the WRKY group IId in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], was also found to have differential expression in our study. This might indicate a crosstalk between cold stress response and plant-pathogen interaction in cassava.</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned TFs, we found two AREBs that were cold-repressed in our study. These factors belonged to group A bZIP transcription factors, which play a role in plant pathogen responses, light signaling, and ABA and abiotic stress signaling, and were induced by salt and ABA in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The zinc finger family has been demonstrated to be involved in the cold response in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In our study, we found 3 probes that fell into 2 subfamilies of the zinc finger family (C2H2 and C3H), including 2 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated genes. Zinc finger proteins involve in ROS and abiotic stress signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene <italic>ZAT12</italic>-like was induced not only by cold stress, but also by PEG and salt stress, as illustrated by our real-time RT-PCR results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This indicates that cassava needs to trigger the expression of ROS-scavenging genes to adapt oxidative stress. The plant-specific NAC transcription factor family has been implicated in plant development processes, such as shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance and organ differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. We found only one transcript encoding for the NAC domain transcription factor, which was down-regulated on the array. In addition, five novel transcription factor families (ABI3-VP1, JUMONJI, LIM, Sigma70-like, and TCP) were also identified. Their homologous genes in other plant species have not yet been reported in response to cold stress, suggesting that these genes might be specific to cassava and are attractive targets for further functional characterization.</p></sec><sec><title>Cold-responsive genes related to 'Chloroplast'</title><p>The category of 'Chloroplast' was an abundant and important GO Slim. It accounted for 21.06% of total GOs in 'Cellular Component' (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>), indicating that a great number of chloroplast-associated genes changed their expression to adapt to cold. This result suggests that the chloroplast might be one of the major organelles affected, as supported by the observation of damaged chloroplasts in cold-stressed leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Although the differential expression of chloroplast-related genes might also be affected by other environmental changes on cassava plants during the treatment, i.e. light change, low temperature was the dominant factor in this study.</p><p>Chloroplast is an important organelle unique to plant cells and is the site of photosynthesis. In previous reports, cold stress could reduce the rate of photosynthesis by interfering with the function of many photosynthesis-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In our study, 43 out of 319 cold-responsive transcripts were assigned to the 'Chloroplast' class, including 22 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Among them, several genes encoding protein localized to thylakoid were identified. For examples, <italic>CAB1 </italic>(chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1), a lipid-associated family protein, a thylakoid leumenal 20 kDa protein, and a hypothetical protein (CUST_7076) were all up-regulated under cold stress. In contrast, <italic>LHCA4 </italic>(photosystem I light harvesting complex gene 4), <italic>PsaL </italic>(photosystem I subunit L), and the rubredoxin family protein were dramatically down-regulated. Two of them (<italic>LHCA4 </italic>and <italic>PsaL</italic>) have also been proposed to be involved in photosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. These results suggested that differential expression of chloroplast genes, especially those encoding for thylakoid associated proteins, by cold stress might lead to the processes of thylakoid distortion, chloroplast malfunction, and photosynthesis inhibition.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Low temperature responsive transcripts related to

Their homologous genes have been reported to be implicated in GA, auxin, ethylene (ETH), and ABA-mediate hormone signal transduction, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In plants, these hormones play crucial roles in a diverse set of developmental processes, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. For example, ABA accumulates in response to abiotic stresses, such as cold, salt, and drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Among these hormone-related genes in <italic>Arabidopsis, GAI </italic>has been also reported to decrease its transcript levels in response to cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and <italic>ERF2 </italic>has been identified in the response to chitin, a plant-defense elicitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that the differential regulation of genes involved in hormone signal transduction might play key roles in the early cold stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Two other important pathways, including 'Phenylalanine metabolism' (ath00360) and 'Plant-pathogen interaction' (ath04626), were also found in our study to be regulated. <italic>PDS1 </italic>(phytoene desaturation 1), <italic>ASP3 </italic>(Aspartate aminotransferase 3), and peroxidase 72, associated with 'phenylalanine metabolism', were all highly accumulated in response to cold. As noted in previous studies, <italic>PDS1 </italic>has been reported to be engaged in the carotenoid and plastoquinone biosynthetic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. <italic>ASP3</italic>, also participating in proline metabolism, has been shown to be associated with leaf senescence and to be induced in response to darkness and ethylene-induced artificial senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and other plants, proline levels are mainly determined by balance of biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, controlled by <italic>P5CS </italic>(&#x025b3;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase) and <italic>ProDH </italic>(proline dehydrogenase) genes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Up-regulation of cassava homologous genes <italic>P5CS </italic>and <italic>ASP3</italic>, and down-regulation of <italic>ProDH</italic>, which were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), might correlate with the high accumulation of proline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Peroxidase 72, a member of the Class III peroxidases, is involved in the response to oxidation stress and potassium resupply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Additionally, transcripts from MAP Kinase 4, <italic>UNE14 </italic>(unfertilized embryo sac 14), and <italic>TCH2</italic>, members of the 'Plant-pathogen interaction' pathway, were also induced by cold (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). MAP Kinase 4 and <italic>TCH2 </italic>have been shown to be involved in response to several stresses, including cold, salinity, and heat in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; whereas <italic>UNE14 </italic>also encodes a calcium ion binding protein. These results indicate that calcium ion binding proteins and kinase-mediated signal transduction may play pivotal roles in cold stress response in cassava.</p><table-wrap id="T4"

In cold-stressed leaves, starch granules were found to have disappeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Even though their total sugar content remained unchanged after 4 h and was lower after 9 h of treatment, an obvious increase was detected after 24 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Interestingly, sucrose was significantly accumulated and reached the highest level in 9 h; whereas glucose levels were only slightly increased under cold stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These results suggested that soluble sugars might act as both osmolytes and signal molecules in the cold response of cassava, similar to other plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. It also provided insight into the hypothesis that starch degradation provides conserve energy for plants under adverse conditions. Such transition from synthesis metabolism to degradation metabolism would also explain the reduced productivity observed in plants under stress conditions.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Contents of total soluble sugars (A) and sucrose and glucose (B) in cassava leaves subjected to cold (7&#x000b0;C) for 0, 4, 9, and 24 h</bold>.

Despite many pathways, e.g., 'Plant hormone signal transduction' (ath04075), 'Fatty acid biosynthesis' (ath00061), and 'Starch and sucrose metabolism' (ath00500), have been well-demonstrated in other plant species, regulation of different pathways or gene has been observed, illustrating that a complex and specific network is involved in the early cold response in cassava.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of microarray results by real-time RT-PCR</title><p>To validate our microarray data, real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed on 18 selected differentially expressed transcripts, including 13 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). These genes belong to divergent functional categories or pathways. For instance, four genes [gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, unknown protein (CUST_16591), ubiquitin-protein ligase, and <italic>GSTU19</italic>] were involved in 'Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'Response to stress'. One gene (protein phosphatase 2C) was implicated in 'Protein metabolism,' and other three genes [AP2 domain transcription factor (CUST_20765), C2H2-type zinc finger (<italic>ZAT12</italic>-like), and <italic>PCL1 </italic>(CUST_3593)] were grouped as transcription factors. In addition, 3 genes (ubiquitin-protein ligase, <italic>TCH2</italic>, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase) were assigned to 'Circadian rhythm-plant' (ath04712), 'Plant-pathogen interaction', and 'Arginine and proline metabolism' (ath00330), respectively. Seven genes that are unclassified in the GO Slims or pathways but displayed significant changes in transcript abundance were also tested. For these genes, the fold change (-&#x025b3;&#x025b3;Ct) measured by real-time RT-PCR and by microarray was highly consistent (72.2% and 94.4% for 4 h/0 h and 9 h/0 h, respectively). Their expression kinetics from the real-time RT-PCR results was similar to those of the microarray analysis. These results re-confirmed the accuracy of our microarray data.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes responsive to different stresses and their tissue-specific expressions</title><p>The cold stress-signaling pathway may interact with other signaling systems of, for example, ABA, salt, and drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The expression patterns of the 13 cold-responsive genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR using cassava <italic>in vitro </italic>shoot cultures treated with 100 &#x003bc;M ABA, 25% PEG, and 250 mM NaCl for 6 h. Genes with fold changes larger than 4 were defined as strongly responsive to the stresses. Several cold-responsive genes were also strongly induced by ABA, PEG, or salt stress (e.g., CUST_16591, novel protein with unknown function; CUST_12461, C2H2-type zinc finger, <italic>ZAT12</italic>-like; CUST_4383, gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). These results indicated that dynamic crosstalk exists among signaling pathways related to cold, drought, and salt in cassava because all of these stresses cause cellular dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Genes uniquely responsive to cold stress drew more attention in our study, such as <italic>TCH2 </italic>(CUST_17985), AP2 domain transcription factor (CUST_20765), and JAZ7 (jasmonate-ZIM-domain protein 7, CUST_9007) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Both TCH2 and JAZ7 were involved in the 'Plant-pathogen interaction' in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>) and rice, suggesting that chilling-induced processes share some common features with the defense mechanism against pathogens in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In addition, protein transmembrane transporter (CUST_13673), which was strongly induced by ABA and salt stress, was also believed to function in early signal reception.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Real-time RT-PCR verification of cold responsive gene under the different abiotic stresses and ABA treatment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Probe Name</th><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left">ABA</th><th align="left">PEG</th><th align="left">NaCl</th><th align="left">Cold</th><th align="left">AGI Locus</th><th align="left">E Value</th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="4"><hr/></th><th/><th/></tr><tr><th/><th/><th align="center" colspan="4">Log<sub>2 </sub>Ratio</th><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">CUST_12461</td><td align="left">C2H2-type zinc finger ZAT-12 like</td><td align="left">1.45</td><td align="left"><bold>2.26</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>2.63</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>3.89</bold></td><td align="left">AT2G28710</td><td align="left">1.60E-25</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_16591</td><td align="left">Unknown protein</td><td align="left"><bold>2.52</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>4.91</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>2.49</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>2.30</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_4383</td><td align="left">gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase</td><td align="left">1.12</td><td align="left">1.71</td><td align="left"><bold>2.52</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>2.65</bold></td><td align="left">AT1G30040</td><td align="left">4.70E-51</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_17985</td><td align="left">TCH2 (calcium ion binding protein)</td><td align="left">-0.72</td><td align="left">-0.62</td><td align="left">-0.41</td><td align="left"><bold>2.75</bold></td><td align="left">AT5G37770</td><td align="left">2.10E-39</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_20765</td><td align="left">AP2 domain transcription factor</td><td align="left">1.08</td><td align="left">-0.61</td><td align="left">0.38</td><td align="left"><bold>2.16</bold></td><td align="left">AT1G21910</td><td align="left">4.70E-29</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_9007</td><td align="left">JAZ7 (jasmonate-ZIM-domain protein 7)</td><td align="left">0.11</td><td align="left">-0.57</td><td align="left">-0.43</td><td align="left"><bold>2.16</bold></td><td align="left">AT2G34600</td><td align="left">2.70E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_9556</td><td align="left">CAB1 (chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1)</td><td align="left">1.24</td><td align="left">0.21</td><td align="left">0.65</td><td align="left">1.94</td><td align="left">AT1G29930</td><td align="left">9.00E-134</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_13673</td><td align="left">protein transmembrane transporter</td><td align="left"><bold>3.22</bold></td><td align="left">1.85</td><td align="left"><bold>4.04</bold></td><td align="left">1.73</td><td align="left">AT4G16160</td><td align="left">3.40E-55</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_5990</td><td align="left">phosphoric monoester hydrolase</td><td align="left">1.21</td><td align="left">-1.58</td><td align="left">0.09</td><td align="left">1.64</td><td align="left">AT1G17710</td><td align="left">8.60E-90</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_14166</td><td align="left">GSTU19 (glutathione transferase)</td><td align="left">1.00</td><td align="left">1.66</td><td align="left">1.01</td><td align="left">-0.74</td><td align="left">AT1G78380</td><td align="left">1.90E-70</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_19213</td><td align="left">Unknown protein</td><td align="left">0.41</td><td align="left">0.00</td><td align="left">-0.13</td><td align="left">-1.43</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_7527</td><td align="left">Unknown protein</td><td align="left">-0.11</td><td align="left">-1.21</td><td align="left">-1.83</td><td align="left">-0.70</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">CUST_1923</td><td align="left">S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase</td><td align="left">0.59</td><td align="left">-0.90</td><td align="left">-0.64</td><td align="left">-0.70</td><td align="left">AT3G02470</td><td align="left">1.40E-08</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><bold>Notes: </bold>Thirteen selected cold responsive genes were analyzed under different treatments, including 100 &#x003bc;M ABA, 25% PEG, 200 mM NaCl, and cold stress (7&#x000b0;C) for 6 h.

ROS scavenging enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione transferase (GST), have been demonstrated to play key roles in the removal of ROS. In our DEGs, several genes encoding ROS scavenging enzymes were recorded to be target to chloroplast, including <italic>CAT2 </italic>and <italic>GSTU19 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

The up-regulation of four ROS-scavenging transcripts (CAT2, peroxidase 72, GST1 and microsomal GST) was verified by real-time RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis, CAT2 </italic>was reported to be induced by cold stress and <italic>GSTU19 </italic>was responsive to many biotic and abiotic stresses, such as water deprivation and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. To further validate the function of ROS scavenging enzymes after exposure to cold stress, the activities of CAT and SOD in cassava leaves subjected to 7&#x000b0;C were measured. Consistent with the microarray data, an increase in CAT activity was observed after 9 h of cold treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). Similarly, a significant elevation in SOD activity was also observed after 4 h of cold stress, and such increases continued for 24 h after the initiation of stress treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). These results including induction of <italic>ZAT12</italic>-like gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) suggested that ROS signaling pathways, including ROS scavenging enzymes, were involved in the ROS detoxification induced by the cold stress response in cassava. Similarly, rice and maize, as chilling-sensitive tropical crops, could only withstand transient and milder cold stress. In japonica rice, an oxidative-mediated network has been proposed to play a key role in the early response to chilling stress and short-term defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], and insufficient antioxidant defenses are thought to cause maize chilling sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Generally, the ultra-structural changes of the chloroplast (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and oxidative burst were typically characteristic of PCD in plants, indicating that PCD may be a part of an adaptive mechanism to survive stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study presented a genome-wide gene expression profiling of cassava subjected to cold stress using the microarray technology. Overall, the transcriptomic responses of cassava to cold stress were basically consistent with the changes seen in other plants under abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. A considerable amount of specific cassava genes related to different biological functions were identified. For examples, many new stress-responsive genes or TFs, such as early flower 4, <italic>ERF2</italic>, and AP2 domain transcription factor (CUST_2332), were found, suggesting that various regulatory pathways may exist in cassava together with the well-characterized CBF pathway. Based on the comprehensive transcriptomic, real-time RT-PCR and physiological analyses, our study supports the fact that crosstalks among different signaling systems play an important role in regulating the cold stress response in tropical plants. Thus, a hypothetical model for depicting the components involved in cold response networks in cassava could be established (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Plants may perceive low temperature through cell membrane receptors, most likely transmembrane proteins, and by membrane modification through fatty acid synthesis (e.g., FAB1 and SSI2). Then, the cold signal transduction might induce cellular metabolism changes, such as the calcium signaling cascade, hormone signal transduction, and ROS signaling. The calcium signaling pathway may stimulate the calcium ion binding protein, leading to the activation of cascade kinase activities (e.g., MAP kinase 4), which could switch on various cold stress-responsive genes and transcription factor family proteins (e.g., AP2-EREBP, HSF, and GRAS). Hormone (auxin, ABA, GA, ETH, and JA) signal transduction could also be activated to alter plant growth status in order to adapt to stress condition through the differential regulation of their downstream genes (e.g., SAUR, AREB3, GAI, ERF2, and JAZ7, respectively). Moreover, other metabolisms could also take part in the process, including starch and sucrose metabolism (e.g., TPS7 and AMY1), amino acid metabolism (e.g., ASP3 and PDS1), and the ROS scavenging system (e.g., catalase 2, SOD, and GSTs). Apparently, the balance between cell damage and tolerance might decide the fate for cold-stressed cassava plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). On the other hand, a large number of genes (about 37.2% of total 508 DEGs) encode proteins of unknown functions. Studying these genes may reveal novel mechanisms that are fundamental to the ability of cassava to cope with cold stress.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular model of the early cold response in cassava</bold>. Two biological processes, namely stress perception and the physiological response, are illustrated. After signal reception, stress-activated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling, ROS signaling, and hormone signaling modulate the expression of stress-responsive genes, which include metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, kinases, and ion transporters. The physiological changes that manifested as membrane modification, chloroplast malfunction, and starch and sucrose metabolism, as well as amino acid metabolism, cause cassava to either have increased cold tolerance or to enter into accelerated programmed cell death. Their balance determines the outcome of the stressed cassava plant. Selected up- and down-regulated genes are in red or blue, respectively.
