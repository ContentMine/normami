The differentiated cells can be converted into stem cells in some metazoans and land plants with appropriate treatments. After leaves of the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> are excised, leaf cells reenter the cell cycle and commence tip growth, which is characteristic of stem cells called chloronema apical cells. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, a digital gene expression profiling method using mRNA 5&#x02032;-end tags (5&#x02032;-DGE) was established. The 5&#x02032;-DGE method produced reproducible data with a dynamic range of four orders that correlated well with qRT-PCR measurements. After the excision of leaves, the expression levels of 11&#x00025; of the transcripts changed significantly within 6 h. Genes involved in stress responses and proteolysis were induced and those involved in metabolism, including photosynthesis, were reduced. The later processes of reprogramming involved photosynthesis recovery and higher macromolecule biosynthesis, including of RNA and proteins.

These protruded cells have characteristics of chloronema apical cells, which are a type of stem cell in <italic>P. patens</italic>. In regular development, chloronema apical cells are formed after spore germination and they self-renew and repeatedly produce chloronema cells. As chloronema apical cells, the reprogrammed leaf cells reenter the cell cycle, self-renew, and produce cells indistinguishable from chloronema cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036471-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0036471-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0036471.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Reprogramming from leaf cells to chloronema apical cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper parts of gametophores.

On the other hand, transcriptome profiles during the reprogramming process of mosses have not been studied. Thus, the differences and similarities in expression profiles during the direct change into stem cells in the moss compared to callus and meristem formation in flowering plants are unknown.</p><p>Massive parallel sequencing technology has enabled measurements of the expression levels of transcripts with a large dynamic range by sequencing cDNA. RNA-seq is a method involving sequencing short reads covering the entire region of a transcript <xref rid="pone.0036471-Mortazavi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and TSS-seq specifically detects transcriptional start sites by employing the oligo-capping method <xref rid="pone.0036471-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036471-Tsuchihara1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. RNA-seq data are usually normalized for the length of the transcript as RPKM <xref rid="pone.0036471-Mortazavi2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The stochastic error is roughly proportional to the square root of the number of tags but not to that of RPKM, and having more tags for longer transcripts necessitates more total reads to achieve a given level of stochastic error for shorter transcripts.</p><p>5&#x02032;-end sequencing with oligo-capping <xref rid="pone.0036471-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> requires multiple enzymatic reaction steps to remove the endogenous cap structure and ligate a synthetic oligonucleotide before converting the transcript to cDNA. Plessy et al. recently reported a new method called nanoCAGE <xref rid="pone.0036471-Plessy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which utilizes template switching <xref rid="pone.0036471-Kulpa1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036471-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> to capture transcriptional start sites (TSSs) from small amounts of RNA <xref rid="pone.0036471-Plessy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although nanoCAGE is useful to detect a wide variety of TSSs in a genome-wide manner <xref rid="pone.0036471-Plessy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, its quantitative nature with regard to mRNA accumulation is unclear.</p><p>Here, to analyze expression profiles of <italic>P. patens</italic>, we employed the template-switching reaction and established a simpler method for detecting the 5&#x02032;-end of mRNA and obtaining a quantitative digital measure of transcripts using a SOLiD parallel DNA sequencer (Life Technologies). Transcriptome profiles during moss stem cell formation were investigated from early time points through the time at which reprogrammed cells protrude and divide. The expression profiles showed that transcripts sequentially changed by 6 h after dissection, which is earlier than the detection of tip growth and cytokinesis at approximately 24 h after dissection. Comparison of the profiles to those of stem cell formation via callus in flowering plants revealed that phytohormone-induced genes in flowering plants are also activated in <italic>P. patens</italic>, suggesting that the moss utilizes intrinsic phytohormone regulatory systems for reprogramming. We further found that members of the same gene families are dynamically changed during the reprogramming process in flowering plants and the moss, suggesting that common factors are involved in the regulation of reprogramming in land plants in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of a 5&#x02032;-digital Gene Expression (5&#x02032;-DGE) Library Using the Template-switching Method</title><p>The template-switching method <xref rid="pone.0036471-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> was employed for the construction of a 5&#x02032;-SAGE-like library for SOLiD sequencing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036471-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the workflow for 5&#x02032;-digital gene expression (5&#x02032;-DGE) library construction. The reverse transcription started from biotin TEG-labeled EcoP15I-dT<sub>20</sub> at the polyA tail toward the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA. PrimeScript II reverse transcriptase was selected for high efficiency in reverse transcription and template switching. The reverse transcriptase added a few nucleotides (dC) at the 3&#x02032; end of synthesized cDNA. After switching the template, cDNA synthesis continued to the biotin TEG-labeled DNA/RNA oligonucleotide containing an EcoP15I site (BioTEG-P2EcoP15I-rGx3). Double stranded cDNAs were amplified via 3 cycles of PCR and digested by EcoP15I to produce DNA fragments consisting of P2EcoP15I and 25 bp of cDNA with a two-base 5&#x02032; overhang. Digested fragments were captured with streptavidin beads and ligated with P1 adaptors containing two-base overhangs. The resulting 25 bp 5&#x02032; cDNA fragments sandwiched by P1 and P2EcoP15I adaptors were amplified by 12 additional cycles of PCR for SOLiD 25 bp sequencing. The sequencing started at P1 to avoid having all templates contain the same EcoP15I sequence during the early cycles. Thus, the sequence starts 25 bp downstream of 5&#x02032; end of the RNA toward the 5&#x02032; start site. When unmodified EcoP15I-dT<sub>20</sub> was used for reverse transcription, byproducts containing the EcoP15I-dT<sub>20</sub> sequence were observed. These byproducts were suppressed by introducing the 5&#x02032;-end biotin-TEG modification to EcoP15I-dT<sub>20</sub>.</p><fig id="pone-0036471-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0036471.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Workflow for 5&#x02032;-DGE library preparation.</title><p>(a) 1st strand cDNA is synthesized from mRNA.

The unmapped reads may contain splice junctions and reads having more than two errors. The proportion of low-information reads with fewer than four non-0 color bases ranged from 0.3 to 5&#x00025; of the mappable tags and may represent differences in library preparation or instability of the instrument. The percentage of mappable tags that were uniquely mapped ranged from 82&#x00025; to 90&#x00025;. Excluding the low-information reads, the percentage ranged 85&#x00025; to 90&#x00025;.

It was frequently observed that a sharp peak existed 5&#x02032; of the annotated gene model and lower levels of tags were distributed over the exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036471-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The 5&#x02032; peak corresponded well to the 5&#x02032; proximal end of the 5&#x02032; EST of full-length cDNA libraries constructed with the cap-trapper method <xref rid="pone.0036471-Nishiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The tag in the peak was thus considered to originate from the capped mRNA of the corresponding gene. The tags on the exon could be derived from truncated mRNA, from a template-switch event occurring before the 5&#x02032; end was reached during reverse transcription, or from alternative transcription start sites. Only 7,179 out of 35,937 had 5&#x02032; UTR annotation and 44&#x00025; of tags were out of the region annotated as transcripts. To count the number of tags for a gene including the untranslated and coding regions, we defined a region for each gene that is wider than the annotated gene model, because the gene model often lacks annotation for untranslated regions. The length of the extension was defined as 2 kb for the 5&#x02032; end and 1 kb for the 3&#x02032; end. In cases in which two genes with the same direction are present within a short distance, the intervening region was divided for the two genes so that the expansion did not create an overlap. While 56&#x00025; of mapped tags was on the originally annotated region, 94&#x00025; was on the expanded region in the test1 sample. The regions comprise 180 Mbp or 38&#x00025; of the genome after the expansion.

In the forward site, there was a slight trend that more tags were observed 3&#x02032; to the site, and a sharp peak existed at position 32 (0 is the first C of CAGCAG).

An advantage of the nanoCAGE method is that it is applicable to very small amounts of RNA, samples of as little as 10 ng can be used by employing semisuppressive PCR before EcoP15I digestion, whereas the method presented here uses a minimal number of PCR cycles to diminish the skew potentially introduced by PCR. The data from nanoCAGE includes non-polyA RNA species because random primers are included in the reverse transcription reaction, whereas the 5&#x02032;-DGE method specifically selects polyadenylated RNA.

Whereas the developers of the nanoCAGE method observed enrichment of capped RNA by the template-switch reaction, whether capped RNA is enriched in the 5&#x02032;-DGE method is unclear, as we observed tags on exons other than those that are proximal to the 5&#x02032; end of the transcript.</p><p>While we simply counted all tags on the region, which will give estimates similar to what would be measured by qPCR of 3&#x02032; UTR, counting tags only in 5&#x02032; UTR might be sensible as estimator of translatable intact RNA molecules. Such counting after more thorough annotation may be useful for study of RNA dynamics.</p><p>In contrast to microarray-based techniques, deep sequencing approaches do not require probe design. This advantage is more prominent in organisms other than typical model species, in which EST data are not abundant. To obtain a good microarray for expression analysis with small amount of RNA, probes are recommended to be designed on 3&#x02032; UTR, which is virtually impossible to infer <italic>in silico</italic> instead of from EST data. The calculation of expression levels as TPM values is simple and the TPM values have good correlation with the expression levels measured by qRT-PCR without needing to be divided by the length of the mRNA, which is often not precisely known in non-typical model organisms.

Further deep statistical investigation on the nature of the tags may reveal a better treatment of the data.
