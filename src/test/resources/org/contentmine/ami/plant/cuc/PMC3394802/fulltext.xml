In this study, a stress-responsive <italic>NAC</italic> gene, <italic>EcNAC1</italic>, was isolated from the subtracted stress cDNA library generated from a drought adapted crop, finger millet, and characterized for its role in stress-tolerance. The expression analysis showed that <italic>EcNAC1</italic> was highly induced during water-deficit and salt stress. <italic>EcNAC1</italic> shares high amino acid similarity with rice genes that have been phylogenetically classified into stress-related <italic>NAC</italic> genes. Our results demonstrated that tobacco transgenic plants expressing <italic>EcNAC1</italic> exhibit tolerance to various abiotic stresses like simulated osmotic stress, by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mannitol, and salinity stress. The transgenic plants also showed enhanced tolerance to methyl-viologen (MV) induced oxidative stress. Reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-induced damage were noticed in pot grown transgenic lines under water-deficit and natural high light conditions. Root growth under stress and recovery growth after stress alleviation was more in transgenic plants. Many stress-responsive genes were found to be up-regulated in transgenic lines expressing <italic>EcNAC1.</italic> Our results suggest that <italic>EcNAC1</italic> overexpression confers tolerance against abiotic stress in susceptible species, tobacco.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants maintain cellular homeostasis under abiotic stress by adjusting their metabolic systems. The early events of plant adaptation to the environmental stresses involve stress-signal perception and transduction leading to the expression of stress-responsive genes and activation of various physiological and metabolic responses <xref rid="pone.0040397-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Thomashow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Shinozaki1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The products of stress-responsive genes can either directly protect cells against abiotic stress or regulate the expression of other genes. The stress regulatory molecules, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, histidine kinases, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent protein kinases, as well as transcription factors are well characterized <xref rid="pone.0040397-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The expression of stress-responsive genes is largely governed by specific transcription factors. Stress-responsive transcription factors predominantly interact with promoter elements of stress genes often resulting in expression of many functional genes. This has been elegantly shown for DREB and bZIP transcription factors which recognize drought responsible element (DRE) and the abscisic acid responsive element (ABRE), respectively, and activate an array of stress genes <xref rid="pone.0040397-YamaguchiShinozaki1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several families of transcription factors, including ERF/AP2, HSF, bZIP, MYB, MYC, NAC, WRKY, and Zinc-finger, have been well characterized for their regulatory roles in eliciting plant stress-responses <xref rid="pone.0040397-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040397-YamaguchiShinozaki2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>NAC family proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that are characterized by a conserved DNA-binding NAC domain located in the N-terminal region and a variable C-terminal domain <xref rid="pone.0040397-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Although the genomes of rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were predicted to contain 140 and 75 <italic>NAC</italic> genes, respectively, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, only a few members of this large family have been characterized and most of them were reported to be involved in plant growth, development, and hormone signaling <xref rid="pone.0040397-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recently, a few NAC proteins have been described as mediators of biotic and abiotic stress signaling. Expression analysis showed that <italic>NAC</italic> genes, such as <italic>ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072</italic> from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and <italic>BnNAC</italic> from <italic>Brassica napus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Hegedus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, were induced by various environmental stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of a few <italic>NAC</italic> genes has been shown to improve abiotic stress-tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice through activation of several stress genes <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040397-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic>NAC</italic> genes seem to have non-redundant functions though they are stress-induced <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, the function of same transcription factor could behave differently between the species. Surprisingly, overexpression of seven stress-induced <italic>NACs</italic> did not give tolerant phenotype in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Fujita2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, Dubouzet et al. <xref rid="pone.0040397-Dubouzet1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>OsDREB1A</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice improves tolerance to drought, salinity and freezing although a few target genes were not up-regulated in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> which were induced in rice.</p><p>Significant genetic diversity exists among plant species for stress adaptation; hence elucidating the transcriptome from abiotic stress adapted species has greater significance. Several reports have shown that genes from stress adapted species are functionally more efficient in imparting tolerance <xref rid="pone.0040397-Bartels1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Whittaker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Mundree1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Although the studies with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> dissected several abiotic stress pathways, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> being a susceptible species the focus has now been on its related tolerant family or species, namely, <italic>Thellungiella halophila, Thlaspi caerulescens</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic>

Apart from these, other stress adapted species and resurrection plants with very high tolerance threshold may possess mechanisms and genes which make them survive extreme conditions. Two of our recent studies <xref rid="pone.0040397-Gopalakrishna1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Govind1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and also other reports <xref rid="pone.0040397-Waditte1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Majee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> support this concept. Though stress adapted crops such as sorghum and maize genomes have several <italic>NAC</italic> genes, there is no information on the functional relevance of these genes in imparting stress-tolerance and stress-responsive <italic>NACs</italic> are yet to be identified in these species. Hence, discovery and characterization of stress-responsive NAC transcription factors from stress adapted species would provide insight on the importance of these transcription factors.</p><p>Figner millet [<italic>Eleusine coracana</italic> (L.)

The mRNA populations from stress-exposed seedlings were mixed with approximately five-fold excess of complimentary first-strand cDNA from corresponding control seedlings. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from the subtracted poly(A&#x0002b;) RNA was used in generating the library. The cDNA inserts of selected recombinant plaques were successfully amplified by PCR using universal M13 primers and used for sequencing. One of the cDNA clones showed maximum homology to a gene encoding a putative NAC domain containing protein. The identified cDNA was approximately 1 kb with an ORF that could encode a protein of 246 amino acids without the starting methionine suggesting that the <italic>EcNAC1</italic> cDNA clone was truncated in the 5&#x02032; region. The 3&#x02032; end seemed to be intact with 215 bp 3&#x02032; un-translated region followed by a poly(A&#x0002b;) tail. In order to identify and isolate the missing 5&#x02032; end of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> cDNA, we performed 5&#x02032; RACE-PCR with gene specific primer (<named-content content-type="gene">CAGTCATCCAACCTTAGCGATC</named-content>) in the antisense orientation using RLM-RACE kit and amplified a fragment of 690 bp, which was cloned and sequenced.

</title><p>Sequence homology search performed using the deduced amino acid sequence of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> against translated non-redundant nucleotide database using tBLASTN and protein database using BLASTP showed an overall 57&#x02013;59&#x00025; sequence identity to sorghum (GenBank ID: XP002466217), maize (GenBank ID: ACL52720) and rice (Os03g60080) genes as well as many other plant genes encoding NAC proteins. The NAC domain containing proteins are highly conserved across all plants and encoded by multi-gene family. The gene duplications and their subsequent divergence were central to multiplicity of the NAC family. It was very difficult to establish the evolutionary relationship of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> isolated in this study with other plant orthologs based on its NAC domain mediated trans-activation of several downstream genes. The availability of complete genome sequence of rice has provided a reference platform to identify the complete list of genes that encode NAC proteins in rice plants and allowed us to conduct phylogenetic analysis and establish the EcNAC1 relationship with other rice orthologs. A phylogenetic study was conducted using known 140 genes of NAC family full-length protein sequences from rice and also closest accessions from sorghum (GenBank ID: XP002466217) and maize (GenBank ID: ACL52720) along with EcNAC1 sequence by ClustalW program. The EcNAC1 was phylogenetically aligned to a cluster of 14 rice and also sorghum and maize NAC proteins and, particularly, evolutionarily very close to rice NAC ortholog Os03g60080 (SNAC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040397-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to the amino acid sequence homology, several structural motifs predicted based on the MEME program in EcNAC1 polypeptide are well conserved with the same order as in rice (Os03g60080) as well as sorghum and maize NAC proteins except for the motif 6 which is absent in EcNAC1, signifying the unique C-terminal region of the gene and also suggesting that these NAC proteins are evolutionarily evolved from a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040397-g001">Figure 1B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040397.s012">Table S3</xref>). Amino acid sequence similarity of EcNAC1 with known stress-responsive NAC family genes suggests the plausible involvement of this gene in stress adaptation. When translated amino acid sequence was analyzed by PSORT for nuclear localization and nuclear export signals, EcNAC1 showed four residue pattern composed of three basic amino acids (RRR) and H (one residue at 190 and another at 122) with nuclear targeting certainty score of 0.98 for 1. Apart from that, the sequence also showed 7 residue pattern of nuclear targeting at position 176 with two basic residues, ten residues spacer and another basic region consisting of three basic residues out of five residues (KK NEWEKMQMKK GYRRR). In addition, NetNES tool predicted the residue &#x0201c;LAL&#x0201d; at 213 amino acid with calculated nuclear export signal score exceeding the threshold score suggesting the particular residue is expected to participate in a nuclear export signal.

NAC family transcription factors, specific to plants, have been implicated in plant developmental programs <xref rid="pone.0040397-Vroemen1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, defense <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hegedus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Collinge1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> and abiotic stress responses <xref rid="pone.0040397-Yokotani1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Takasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Only a few stress-responsive NAC proteins have been characterized <xref rid="pone.0040397-Nakashima2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> for their relevance in imparting tolerance to abiotic stresses. From this context, characterizing other <italic>NAC</italic> family genes or the stress-responsive homologs from stress adapted species provides greater insight about this unique group of transcription factors.</p><p>Several studies have shown that stress adapted species have structurally efficient genes and regulatory pathways which impart stress-tolerance. For example, overexpression of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> antiporter gene, <italic>ApNhaP</italic>, from a halo-tolerant Cyanobacterium has drastically improved the salt-tolerance of freshwater Cyanobacterium <xref rid="pone.0040397-Waditte1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. To identify stress-responsive transcription factors from a stress adapted plant species, finger millet, subtracted stress cDNA library was constructed and a gene encoding NAC protein was identified. Sequence analysis of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> gene isolated from the library suggested that <italic>EcNAC1</italic> is closely related to a few known stress-responsive rice genes that encode NAC proteins. Previously, Fang et al. <xref rid="pone.0040397-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> have systematically analyzed protein sequences of 140 putative <italic>NAC</italic> or <italic>NAC</italic>-like genes in rice and classified them into five groups (I&#x02013;V). Based on trait specificity, stress-related <italic>NAC</italic> genes fell into the group III stress-responsive <italic>NAC</italic> genes. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequence of EcNAC1 along with rice NAC proteins and also the closest accessions of maize and sorghum showed that this gene actually represents the group III, suggesting its stress-responsive nature. MEME-based prediction of putative motifs among this cluster showed that N-terminal regions were conserved in parallel with NAC domain structure and EcNAC1 appear to have unique motif 6 in the C-terminal region. In a recent study, it was shown that overexpression of <italic>PINO1,</italic> from a halophytic wild rice <italic>Porteresia coarctata</italic>, in rice and tobacco has substantially improved salt tolerance compared to its domesticated rice homolog <italic>RINO1</italic> which lacks a unique stretch of 37 amino acids <xref rid="pone.0040397-Majee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The same group also identified <italic>PcIMT1</italic> gene, from <italic>Porteresia coarctata</italic>, which is absent in domesticated rice and overexpression of this gene has resulted in accumulation of pinitol under salt stress in rice <xref rid="pone.0040397-Sengupta1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> suggesting stress adapted species might have novel candidate genes or unique mechanisms which could help genetic engineering of susceptible species for improved stress-tolerance. Expression analysis of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> in our studies also confirms its stress-responsiveness. <italic>EcNAC1</italic> was induced in finger millet seedlings/plants exposed to water-deficit and salinity stress. Among several <italic>NAC</italic> genes identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, only a few were shown to be stress-responsive <xref rid="pone.0040397-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040397-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Takasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Nogueira1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> and are grouped under stress-responsive <italic>NAC</italic> genes. The promoter regions of some of these genes have DRE and ABRE sequences <xref rid="pone.0040397-Takasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Sakuma1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. The promoter characterization of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> which has highest homology with rice <italic>SNAC1</italic> could help in understanding the pathway through which the gene is regulated.</p><p>The major focus in this study was to identify genes from drought adapted crop, finger millet, and study whether genes from tolerant species can impart better stress-tolerance in a susceptible species. We used tobacco as susceptible species and tested the relevance of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> for stress-tolerance. As tobacco was used as system to transform <italic>EcNAC1</italic>, the stress-responsive nature of endogenous <italic>NAC</italic> gene was also analysed to understand the regulation of related NAC genes in tobacco. The closest homolog of a partial fragment was identified from TIGR database (TIGR index# TC5942) and designated as <italic>NtNAC</italic>. qRT-PCR analysis showed more than 10 and 5 fold higher expression of the EST over control under dehydration and salinity, respectively, suggesting the stress induction of related <italic>NAC</italic> genes in tobacco (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040397.s009">Figure S9</xref>). There are contrasting reports on the effect of constitutive overproduction of regulatory molecules, such as transcription factors, on growth under normal condition <xref rid="pone.0040397-Dubouzet1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040397-Cong1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. However, overexpression of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> in tobacco plants did not affect growth under normal condition. Similar results were observed in overexpression studies of other transcription factors. Oh et al. <xref rid="pone.0040397-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> reported that the transgenic plants expressing <italic>CBF3</italic> (<italic>C-repeat binding factor 3</italic>) under <italic>Ubiquitin1</italic> promoter exhibited no visible phenotypic alterations in rice. These reports and our present result suggest that the growth abnormalities observed in many transgenic plants constitutively expressing the regulatory genes is not a universal phenomenon.</p><p>Most of the <italic>EcNAC1</italic> overexpressing transgenic lines showed increased tolerance to osmotic and salinity stress. The growth rates of transgenic lines on simulated osmotic stress by PEG were remarkably higher than wild-type plants under short-term stress. Such a response was also observed under long-term stress experiments. Transgenic plants expressing NAC transcription factors including <italic>SNAC1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <italic>ONAC063</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Yokotani1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and <italic>OsNAC5</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Takasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> have shown osmotic stress-tolerance at various stages. Overexpression of <italic>SNAC1</italic> not only improved drought resistance at vegetative stage in transgenic rice but also improved yield under field stress <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>SNAC2</italic> also effectively improved PEG-induced osmotic stress-tolerance in rice seedlings <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings overexpressing <italic>ONAC063</italic> showed higher germination rates under mannitol-induced osmotic stress <xref rid="pone.0040397-Yokotani1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Conversely, overexpression of seven other <italic>NAC</italic> genes, whose expression is induced by exogenous ABA treatment, drought or high salinity <xref rid="pone.0040397-Seki1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, did not impart salt tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Fujita2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, suggesting all stress-induced genes may not give tolerant phenotype. In our study, <italic>EcNAC1</italic> was induced by salinity and we also observed superior salt tolerance of many <italic>EcNAC1</italic> transgenics.</p><p>Other notable observation is that substantial superior root growth of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> transgenic lines compared to the improved shoot growth. Recently a few studies have shown the role of NAC proteins in root growth thereby improving salt stress-tolerance. He et al. <xref rid="pone.0040397-He1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> have suggested the involvement of <italic>NAC</italic> genes in improving <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root growth under salinity stress. Overexpression of <italic>AtNAC1</italic> and <italic>AtNAC2</italic> resulted in altered lateral root development. In addition, the auxin responsive genes <italic>AIR3</italic> (<italic>Auxin Induced in Root cultures 3</italic>) and <italic>DBP</italic> (<italic>DNA-Binding Protein</italic>) were identified in a screen for downstream targets of <italic>NAC1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>GmNAC20</italic> has promoted lateral root formation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under salt stress <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hao1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. However, there is no direct evidence to support the involvement of NAC transcription factors in root growth under osmotic/dehydration and oxidative stress. We observed that under PEG and mannitol-induced osmotic stress, high salinity as well as oxidative stress there was significant increase in the root growth of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> transgenic plants when compared to wild-type tobacco plants. Transgenic plants showed not only improved root growth but also better lateral root formation. Understanding the phytohormone signaling pathway in <italic>NAC</italic> overexpressing plants may provide further insight in this direction.</p><p>By <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies using transgenic <italic>EcNAC1</italic> seedlings, we provided evidences that <italic>EcNAC1</italic> imparts tolerance to MV-induced oxidative stress. One of the major factors when plants are exposed to stress under high light is the generation of cytotoxic compounds like ROS <xref rid="pone.0040397-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. The levels of these cytotoxic compounds in pot grown transgenic plants subjected to gradual water-deficit stress under natural high light condition was relatively less. These results are further substantiated by lower lipid peroxidation in transgenic plants as shown by lower levels of MDA. Thus, it is conceivable that the ROS-scavenging and membrane-protecting properties of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> accounts, at least partially, for the enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress in transgenic tobacco plants. In rice <italic>OsNAC6</italic> overexpression plants, several biotic and abiotic responsive genes were up-regulated. A transient trans-activation assay also demonstrated the expression of peroxidase in <italic>OsNAC6</italic> transformants. Further, in a recent study by Balazadeh et al. <xref rid="pone.0040397-Balazadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, it was demonstrated that the up-regulation of several downstream stress-responsive genes having consensus <italic>cis</italic>-elements [RCGTR(4&#x02013;5n)RYACGCAA; R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;A or G; Y&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;C or T] is regulated by NAC transcription factors. Among them, many are oxidative stress associated genes. This signifies the roles of a few NAC transcription factors in regulation of oxidative stress-tolerance.</p><p>We observed the expression pattern of closest tobacco homologs of a few <italic>SNAC1</italic> target genes <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; presuming <italic>EcNAC1</italic> might also have common target genes to regulate because of its 57&#x00025; identity at protein level with <italic>SNAC1</italic>. There was up-regulation of a few stress-responsive genes such as <italic>HB-13, MYB, PP2C</italic>, <italic>STPK</italic>, <italic>CytOR</italic>, <italic>ROP</italic> and <italic>ERD1.</italic> The involvement of some of these genes in stress-tolerance is well studied (HD proteins <xref rid="pone.0040397-Dezar1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>; MYB related transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0040397-Kasuga2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>; <italic>PP2C</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Miyazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>; serine-threonine protein kinase <xref rid="pone.0040397-Rentel1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>; Rop subfamily GTPase <xref rid="pone.0040397-Fujiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>; <italic>ERD1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040397-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>). NAC transcription factor has been shown previously to activate several downstream functional genes involved in stress adaptation <xref rid="pone.0040397-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040397-Takasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Even though different NAC transcription factors interact with core <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences in the promoters of target genes but the actual set of target genes for each paralog vary in different plants. Both <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA sequences and transacting transcription factor amino acid sequences have co-evolved to regulate the coordinated expression of several stress adaptive genes. Similarly, the architecture of promoter sequences within these stress-related genes are not simply collinear, they are multifunctional and modular, and interact with multiple independently regulated transcription factors and display a transcriptional complexity to cope up with the cross-talk in response to various environmental stresses. Taken together these results indicate that transgenic overexpression of <italic>EcNAC1</italic> in tobacco positively correlates with stress-tolerance.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that <italic>EcNAC1</italic> is stress-inducible and several known stress-responsive genes are up-regulated in tobacco transgenic plants expressing <italic>EcNAC1</italic> thus conferring tolerance to various abiotic stresses including dehydration, salinity and oxidative stress. Our work suggests the possibility of engineering abiotic stress-tolerance in a crop plant by overexpressing <italic>EcNAC1</italic> gene from a heterologous plant species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0040397.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
