However, the precise role of NAC TFs in relation to fruit ripening is poorly understood. In this study, six <italic>NAC</italic> genes, designated <italic>MaNAC1&#x02013;MaNAC6</italic>, were isolated and characterized from banana fruit. Subcellular localization showed that MaNAC1&#x02013;MaNAC5 proteins localized preferentially to the nucleus, while MaNAC6 was distributed throughout the entire cell. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that MaNAC4 and MaNAC6, as well as their C-terminal regions, possessed <italic>trans</italic>-activation activity. Gene expression profiles in fruit with four different ripening characteristics, including natural, ethylene-induced, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP)-delayed, and a combination of 1-MCP with ethylene treatment, revealed that the <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes were differentially expressed in peel and pulp during post-harvest ripening. <italic>MaNAC1</italic> and <italic>MaNAC2</italic> were apparently upregulated by ethylene in peel and pulp, consistent with the increase in ethylene production. In contrast, <italic>MaNAC3</italic> in peel and pulp and <italic>MaNAC5</italic> in peel were constitutively expressed, and transcripts of <italic>MaNAC4</italic> in peel and pulp and <italic>MaNAC6</italic> in peel decreased, while <italic>MaNAC5</italic> or <italic>MaNAC6</italic> in pulp increased slightly during fruit ripening. Furthermore, the <italic>MaNAC2</italic> promoter was activated after ethylene application, further enhancing the involvement of <italic>MaNAC2</italic> in fruit ripening. More importantly, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses confirmed that MaNAC1/2 physically interacted with a downstream component of ethylene signalling, ethylene insensitive 3 (EIN3)-like protein, termed MaEIL5, which was downregulated during ripening. Taken together, these results suggest that MaNACs such as MaNAC1/MaNAC2, may be involved in banana fruit ripening via interaction with ethylene signalling components.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>banana</kwd><kwd>EIL</kwd><kwd>fruit ripening</kwd><kwd>interaction</kwd><kwd>NAC</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fruit ripening is a complex and genetically programmed process that results in marked changes in colour, flavour, aroma, texture, and nutritional content of the flesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Giovannoni, 2004</xref>). These changes are the result of the coordinated activation of multiple genetic and biochemical pathways, which are influenced by internal and external cues, including regulation by many critical transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Martel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Numerous plant TFs such as apetalous (AP2), basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), myeloblastosis oncogene (MYB), myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC), WRKY, Mcm1-Agamous-Deficiens-Srf (MADS), heat-shock TF (HSF), and several classes of Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins, have been identified and characterized according to their DNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0072">Yamasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The NAC, named after NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF1,2, and CUC2 (cup-shaped cotyledon), constitutes one of the largest families of plant-specific TFs, with 106 members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), 149 members in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0071">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and 101 members in the soybean genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">Pinheiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The distinguishing characteristic of NAC TFs is possession of a highly conserved N-terminal NAC domain, which is divided into five conserved subdomains (A&#x02013;E), and a variable transcriptional regulation C terminus, which is able to activate or repress the transcription of multiple target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Duval <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Hao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">NAC TFs have been implicated to contribute to diverse and vital physiological processes, including shoot apical meristem development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Hibara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), floral morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">Sablowski and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>), leaf formation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Berger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Balazadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">Zhang and Gan, 2012</xref>), embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Larsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), seed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0062">Verza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), flavonoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">Morishita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), grain nutrient remobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0067">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), shoot branching determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and secondary cell-wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0077">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0078">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).

These stress inducible NAC TFs have been shown to bind to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, termed NACRSs (NAC recognition sequences), upstream of other stress responsive genes and activate their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, a few NAC TFs are differentially regulated by various pathways, including microRNA-mediated cleavage of mRNAs and ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Greve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Berger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Although the functions of NAC TFs in many plants have been studied extensively, the involvement of NAC TFs in relation to ripening of economic fruits has generally received less attention.</p><p content-type="indent">Banana (<italic>Musa acuminata</italic>, AAA group), a typical climacteric fruit, is one of the most important food crops after rice, maize, and wheat in tropical and subtropical countries. It comprises an important part in the diet of millions of people around the world. Commercially, it is a very prosperous crop in the world trade. The post-harvest physiology of banana fruit is characterized by a pre-climacteric phase, followed by a peak in ethylene production that orchestrates ripening-associated processes, including climacteric respiration, pulp softening, peel degreening, and the production of aroma compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Clendennen and May, 1997</xref>). However, the physiological climacteric attribute of banana fruit results in a short post-harvest life of 10&#x02013;15 d at ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Bapat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, unlike many other climacteric fruits, the peel and pulp of banana fruit exhibit different ethylene biosynthesis patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Dominguez and Vendrell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Elitzur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). For these reasons, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of fruit ripening, as this will aid in improving the quality and storage potential of this fruit. Some genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis and perception pathways have been identified in banana fruit, including 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, ACC oxidase, ethylene receptor, CTR1 orthologue, and ethylene insensitive 3-like (<italic>EIL</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Clendennen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">Mb&#x000e9;gui&#x000e9;-A-Mbegui&#x000e9; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, there is little information about how ripening-related TFs regulate the ripening of banana fruit in relation to ethylene signalling. Recently, several <italic>MaMADS</italic> TFs were reported to be induced by ethylene, suggesting that the <italic>MADS</italic> TF may participate in banana fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Elitzur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Moreover, current research into fruit ripening is likely to focus on the identification of new candidate genes, as well as understanding the interactions among the already characterized components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>NOR</italic> (non-ripening) is an NAC-domain TF whose mutation results in a non-ripening phenotype including ethylene synthesis, increased respiration, carotenoid accumulation, softening, and aroma volatile production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Martel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>NAC</italic> is also ethylene inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and may represent a TF downstream of the ethylene insensitive 2 gene (<italic>EIN2</italic>) in parallel with <italic>EIN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Al-Daoud and Cameron, 2011</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to study the transcriptional regulatory network concerning <italic>NAC</italic> in relation to the ethylene signal during fruit ripening. In the present study, six <italic>NAC</italic> TFs were isolated and characterized from banana fruit, and the expression patterns of six <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes in the fruit of four different ripening characteristics, including natural, ethylene-induced, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, a competitive inhibitor of ethylene action)-delayed, and a combination of 1-MCP with ethylene treatment (1-MCP+ethylene), were analysed by real-time quantitative PCR. In addition, the promoter of one ripening-related <italic>NAC</italic>, <italic>MaNAC2</italic>, was isolated and its response to ethylene was also investigated. More importantly, the direct interactions between MaNAC1/MaNAC2 and MaEIL5, a downstream component of ethylene signalling, were detected by yeast two-hybrid and the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Our results suggest that <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes may be involved in banana fruit ripening via interaction with ethylene signalling components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and treatments</title><p>Pre-climacteric banana (<italic>Musa acuminata</italic>, AAA group, cv.

From our transcriptome database, there are at least six putative proteins that exhibit a significant sequence identity with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtNAC and rice OsNAC homologues, further confirming the notion that NAC proteins are encoded by a large multigene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">Ooka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The predicted MaNAC paralogues were 20&#x02013;66% identical to each other at the amino acid level (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hwmaint.jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content-embargo/full/ers178/DC1">Supplementary Table S9</ext-link>). Alignment of the six MaNACs proteins showed that they shared a highly conserved N-terminal DBD, termed the NAC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">Ooka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), which contains five consensus subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The NAC domain may function as a potential NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Duval <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Hegedus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Ernst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and most isolated NAC proteins are localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">Pinheiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Hao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Similarly, the subcellular localizations of the MaNACs indicated that MaNAC1&#x02013;MaNAC5 were all localized in the nucleus, while MaNAC6 was distributed throughout the whole cell, including nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thirteen members of the membrane-associated type of NAC proteins have been found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These NACs, which are larger in molecular weight than non-membrane-associated NAC TFs (~320 residues), have residue numbers ranging from 335 to 652, because of their C-terminal extensions, which contain the transmembrane motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">Morishita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, molecular mechanisms that regulate the localization of TFs have been investigated extensively, one of which is cytoplasmic sequestration caused by the presence of a membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Lee and Hannink, 2003</xref>). Following specific cues, membrane-bound precursors are proteolytically cleaved, allowing nuclear localization of the TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">Morishita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). One <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC protein, AtNAC78, has been located in the nucleus and cytoplasm in onion epidermal cells when fused with its full-length sequence (including the transmembrane motif), but was located in the nucleus when the putative transmembrane motif was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">Morishita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, the same is not true for MaNAC6, which includes a similar C-terminal extension to the other five MaNACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the mechanism and role of MaNAC6 localization within whole cells need to be elucidated further. In addition, the C-terminal regions of MaNAC1&#x02013;MaNAC6 proteins are highly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). It has been reported that the non-conserved C-terminal regions of several NAC proteins, but not NAC domains, function as transcriptional activation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Hegedus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), which may confer the regulation diversities of transcriptional activation activity. Our data also showed that, among the six MaNAC proteins, only MaNAC4 and MaNAC6 exhibited transcriptional activation ability in their C-terminal regions, and the NAC domain in their N-terminals did not activate reporter genes in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, it should be pointed out that as the largest TF family in plants, other <italic>NAC</italic> genes may exist in banana fruit and their functions also need to be elucidated.</p><p content-type="indent">
<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> NAC proteins have been classified previously into two groups based on similarities in the NAC domain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">Ooka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Group I is divided into 14 subgroups, namely TERN, ONAC022, SENU5, NAP, AtNAC3, ATAF, OsNAC3, NAC2, ANAC011, TIP, OsNAC8, OsNAC7, NAC1, and NAM, while the remaining four subgroups, comprising ANAC011, ONAC003, ONAC001, and ANAC063, constitute group II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">Ooka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Although many reported NAC TFs are known for their diverse functions, the functions of the majority of members in this family are still unclear. Generally, NAC genes with the same function show a tendency to fall into one subgroup.

Additionally, the membrane-associated NAC proteins that harbour a transmembrane motif with a predicted &#x003b1;-helix in the far C-terminal region have been placed phylogenetically into subgroups ANAC001, TIP, and NAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The members of these subgroups are highly expressed in vegetative organs that are more susceptible to abiotic stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the present work, the six banana <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes fell into four subgroups, in which MaNAC1 and MaNAC3 belonged to ONAC003 and NAM, respectively, while MaNAC2 and MaNAC4 belonged to ONAC022, and MaNAC5 and MaNAC6 belonged to NAC1. These results suggest that <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes may have diverse functions in banana.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Possible roles of MaNAC TFs in relation to banana fruit ripening</title><p>The regulation of fruit ripening has been well studied, and ripening is known to be influenced by hormones, light, temperature, and developmental gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Klee and Giovannoni, 2011</xref>).

Moreover, recently, it has been confirmed that RIN interacts with the promoters of genes involved in the major pathways associated with observed and well-studied ripening phenotypes and phenomena, including the transcriptional control network involved in overall ripening regulation, ethylene biosynthesis, ethylene perception, the downstream ethylene response, cell-wall metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, and aroma formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Martel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0054">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

Other plant NAC TFs, including <italic>Arabidopsis AtNAC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), pepper <italic>CaNAC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">Oh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), rice <italic>OsNAC19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and wheat <italic>TaNAC4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), are also ethylene inducible, supporting the notion that NAC TFs might be a common downstream component of the ethylene signalling pathway. In tomato, <italic>NOR</italic> (non-ripening) is a NAC-domain TF and fruit carrying its mutation, <italic>nor</italic>, cannot ripen even after exogenous ethylene application, suggesting an important role of <italic>NOR</italic> in regulating fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Cara and Giovannoni, 2008</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to investigate whether MaNAC1/MaNAC2 is able to complement ripening in a tomato <italic>nor</italic> mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Interactions between MaNAC1/MaNAC2 and MaEIL5</title><p>NAC TFs have been found not only to bind to DNA but also to interact with other proteins, including several NAC proteins interacting with a RING protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Greve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), a TCP-domain TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0068">Weir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and a SNF1-related kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Kleinow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Moreover, some NAC proteins can interact with other NACs or with themselves to function by forming homodimers and/or heterodimers in plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC1 and ANA019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0070">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Ernst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), <italic>Brassica</italic> BnNAC14 with BnNAC3, BnNAC5-8, BnNAC5-11, and BnNAC485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Hegedus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and rice OsNAC5 with OsNAC6, OsNAC9, OsNAC10, and itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Several groups have reported that NAC may represent a TF downstream of <italic>EIN2</italic> but in parallel with <italic>EIN3</italic>, which is also a TF downstream of <italic>EIN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Al-Daoud and Cameron, 2011</xref>). In the present study, banana MaNAC1/MaNAC2 physically interacted with an EIN3-like protein, MaEIL5, in Y2H and BiFC assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). EIN3 and EIN3-like (EIL) proteins are key TFs in ethylene signalling, and play important roles in regulating fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">Mb&#x000e9;gui&#x000e9;-A-Mbegui&#x000e9; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0074">Yin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our results, together with previous reports, clearly suggest that NAC TFs are involved in ethylene signalling pathways through interaction with ethylene signalling components. However, it should be pointed out that the MaEIL5 transcript level decreased following ethylene evolution during ripening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Generally, EILs act as positive regulators of ethylene response, but levels of <italic>EIL</italic> genes show no increase during fruit ripening, implying that changes in <italic>EIL</italic> mRNA levels may be not necessary to induce an ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0059">Tieman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). At the same time, EILs may be regulated at the post-transcriptional or post-translational level, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0053">Potuschak <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>, who showed that EBF1/EBF2 physically interacted with EIN3/EIL1 and probably targeted these proteins for degradation. Accordingly, it is imperative to study the protein modifications of EILs during banana fruit ripening in the future. In addition, it will be interesting to find why only MaNAC1/MaNAC2, which showed no transcription activation ability in yeast cells, could interact with MaEIL5, while MaNAC4/MaNAC6 with transcription activation ability, could not interact with MaEIL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), and why none of the six MaNACs interacted with MaEIL2 (data not shown), whose transcript level increased during fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In summary, six banana fruit <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes were isolated and characterized. Gene expression profiles in fruit with four different ripening characteristics revealed that <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes are expressed differentially in peel and pulp during ripening. More importantly, MaNAC1/MaNAC2 physically interacted with MaEIL5. Taken together, these results suggest that MaNACs such as MaNAC1 and MaNAC2 may be involved in banana fruit ripening via interaction with ethylene signalling components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that NACs interact physically with EILs, and our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NAC TFs participating in ethylene signalling.</p><p>&#x000a9; 2011 The Authors.</p></sec></sec>
