The genetic improvement of switchgrass for large scale biomass feedstock production started only recently. Currently, most switchgrass cultivars are synthetic, having been selected directly from their original habitats, and average biomass yields range from four to ten tons/acre per year depending on cultivar and field conditions <xref rid="pone.0047399-Lemus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Due to the polyploid genome and gametophytic self-incompatibility of switchgrass, breeding the crop is a significant challenge <xref rid="pone.0047399-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>As the study of switchgrass at the molecular level is relatively new, researchers can benefit from the knowledge gained through the extensive study of model plant species, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Salentijn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Candidate genes isolated from model plant species could also be directly expressed in crop plants, using efficient tissue culture-based genetic transformation systems, to improve agronomically important traits <xref rid="pone.0047399-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In certain cases, novel desirable phenotypes could be triggered by the ectopic expression of a candidate gene in different plant species <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ambavaram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The overexpression of a transcription factor identified from another plant species, especially the potential master regulator of a given signaling pathway, may disturb the biological and metabolic processes of switchgrass and generate extreme or novel phenotypes. Analysis of the gene expression profile of the transgenic genotype may contribute to the functional genomics of switchgrass by associating gene functions with certain phenotypes.</p><p>An erect leaf phenotype can improve plant architecture by decreasing shade effects, thereby maximizing the plant biomass yield of a dense field population <xref rid="pone.0047399-Demura1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Under dense planting conditions, a higher leaf area index (the ratio of the upper leaf surface area to land area) could increase light interception for photosynthesis, and small leaf angles against vertical stems (erect leaves) are required to obtain a high leaf area index <xref rid="pone.0047399-Sakamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Increasingly small leaf angles have been associated with the higher yields of recently developed rice cultivars <xref rid="pone.0047399-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Mutations in several brassinosteroid (BR)-related genes, the overexpression of an <italic>ARGONAUTE</italic> gene (<italic>OsAGO4</italic>), and a mutation in a <italic>KANADI</italic> gene (<italic>SLL1</italic>) have been shown to induce smaller leaf angles in rice plants <xref rid="pone.0047399-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The altered leaf angles could be the result of developmental changes in the leaf collar region, as in the case of several BR-related mutants <xref rid="pone.0047399-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, or could be caused by leaf rolling (upward curved leaf), as in the case of <italic>OsAGO4</italic> and <italic>SLL1</italic> mutants <xref rid="pone.0047399-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In switchgrass, a linear relationship between the leaf area index and seasonal biomass yield has been observed <xref rid="pone.0047399-Madakadze1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The accumulation of aboveground biomass declines after plants begin flowering <xref rid="pone.0047399-VanEsbroeck1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Therefore, plants with delayed flowering time have extended vegetative growth and usually produce more biomass. In switchgrass, lowland ecotypes flower late in high latitude areas, producing higher yields than upland ecotypes <xref rid="pone.0047399-Lemus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although the genetic components controlling switchgrass flowering time have not been characterized, it is hypothesized that they are similar to those of maize because both switchgrass and maize belong to the same subfamily of the PACCAD clade (consisting of the Panicoid, Arundinoid, Chloridoid, Centothecoid, Aristidoid, and Danthonioid lineages) <xref rid="pone.0047399-Demura2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Lawrence2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, maize flowering time, unlike that of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or rice, is primarily controlled by a collection of quantitative loci with smaller effects <xref rid="pone.0047399-Buckler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, although some conserved flowering genes, such as <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>, <italic>ZCN8</italic> in maize) and <italic>INDETERMINATE1</italic> (<italic>ID1</italic>), have also been identified in the maize genome <xref rid="pone.0047399-Colasanti1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The possibility of controlling switchgrass flowering time by identifying and manipulating its flowering genes is an attractive one.</p><p>Lignin is a phenolic polymer derived from three monolignols [hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S)] via combinatorial radical coupling reactions <xref rid="pone.0047399-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In lignocellulosic bioenergy research, reducing the lignin content of switchgrass feedstock is a major improvement objective for several reasons: the high lignin content of switchgrass cell walls prevents hydrolytic enzymes from accessing the polysaccharides, absorbs these hydrolytic enzymes, and inhibits the activities of the hydrolytic and fermentation enzymes used in the biological biofuel conversion process <xref rid="pone.0047399-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The lignin biosynthesis pathways are controlled by at least ten key enzymes that are evolutionarily conserved across angiosperms <xref rid="pone.0047399-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Rastogi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Several transcription factors directly regulating monolignol biosynthetic genes have also been identified in a number of model plant species <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ambavaram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although most orthologous genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis pathways can be identified from the switchgrass EST database and the functions of several lignin genes have been validated in switchgrass, our knowledge of switchgrass lignin biosynthesis is still limited <xref rid="pone.0047399-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Tobias1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The identification and characterization of switchgrass genotypes with differing lignin contents may contribute to the detailed dissection of monolignol pathways.</p><p>Transcription factor proteins bind to conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements and either transactivate or suppress the expression of groups of genes involved in multiple cellular processes <xref rid="pone.0047399-Jedlicka1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The expression of plant transcription factors is controlled by developmental cues and/or environmental stimuli <xref rid="pone.0047399-Century1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the knockout of a transcription factor often results in pleiotropic effects. Conversely, the constitutive expression of a transcription factor may lead to gain-of-function traits. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) domain-containing genes constitute one of largest plant-specific transcription factor families, regulating biotic/abiotic stress responses, photoperiod, and plant development <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Transgenic plants with desirable agronomically important traits have been obtained by the manipulation of NAC transcription factors in various plant species <xref rid="pone.0047399-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Reguera1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It was recently reported that the overexpression of a NAC domain transcription factor gene, <italic>Long Vegetative Phase 1</italic> (<italic>AtLOV1</italic>, At2g02450), contributes to cold tolerance and delayed flowering time under long day photoperiod conditions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. AtLOV1 functions within the photoperiod pathway in which its overexpression negatively regulates the expression of a <italic>CONSTANS</italic> gene (<italic>CO</italic>) and results in a late-flowering phenotype. Interestingly, the overexpression of AtLOV1 also regulates cold response genes such as <italic>COLD-REGULATED 15A</italic> (<italic>COR15A</italic>) and <italic>COLD INDUCED 1</italic> (<italic>KIN1</italic>) to generate cold tolerance in the transgenic lines. Consequently, AtLOV1 has been identified as a master regulator of both flowering and cold response pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>For perennial plants such as switchgrass, enhancing cold tolerance could improve stand establishment and survivability, and delaying flowering time could lead to plants with higher overall biomass. However, delaying flowering time may negatively impact switchgrass survivability over the winter if it causes plants to remain vegetative through the onset of killing frosts <xref rid="pone.0047399-VanEsbroeck2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Casler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Therefore, it is desirable to introduce both late flowering and cold tolerance phenotypes for switchgrass improvement.</p><p>In this paper, we report that switchgrass plants with ectopic overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> have delayed flowering time, erect leaves, and increased lignin content; however, they do not have improved cold tolerance. We performed microarray analysis of the <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic plants, and putative genes involved in flowering control, cell wall biosynthesis and organ development were identified among the 104 genes regulated by <italic>AtLOV1</italic>. Breeding the erect leaves and delayed flowering traits conditioned by the <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgene into elite switchgrass cultivars might improve switchgrass biomass feedstock production, especially under densely planted field conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene Cloning and Switchgrass Genetic Transformation</title><p>A Gateway compatible binary vector pVT1629 <xref rid="pone.0047399-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> modified from pCAMBIA1305.2, in which a <italic>ccd</italic>B(B) cassette could be replaced with the gene of interest through an LR reaction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was developed for switchgrass genetic transformation.

The resultant pVT1629-AtLOV1 vector was transformed into the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain C58C1 through electroporation. Somatic embryogenic calli induced from the seeds of a selected switchgrass line, HR8, were used for genetic transformation <xref rid="pone.0047399-Xu3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The regenerated plants were selected using 50 mg/L of hygromycin B (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Regenerated plants from independent calli were further verified by PCR, GUS staining (data not shown) and Southern blot analysis. More detailed switchgrass tissue culture and transformation methods have been described previously <xref rid="pone.0047399-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Xu3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Soil water content was maintained at &#x0223c;80%. Wild type (WT) plants regenerated from non-transformed calli were also grown under the same conditions. Because switchgrass is self-crossing incompatible, the progeny of T<sub>0</sub> &#x0201c;escapes&#x0201d; were used as WT plants for comparison with the transgenic T<sub>0</sub> plants. T<sub>1</sub> generation transgenic plants were obtained by crossing independent T<sub>0</sub> transgenic plants with the WT controls. The presence or absence of the <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgene in the T<sub>1</sub> plants was detected by PCR using the primers LOV1_BamHFor and LOV1_SalRev (data not shown).

To minimize the effect of the heterogeneous genetic background of switchgrass, we selected three independent T<sub>1</sub> transgenic lines for gene expression analysis. Each T<sub>1</sub> line was propagated in three pots by transplanting split tillers of similar growth stage. Therefore, each pool was taken from three clonal plants of one distinct T<sub>1</sub> line, and three pools were taken from each of three distinct T<sub>1</sub> lines. Nine transgenic plants in total, divided into three replications, were used for this experiment. Plant tissues from three independent T<sub>1</sub> lines were pooled for RNA extraction. The nine transgenic plants were used to produce three RNA samples, which were considered as three biological replicates. As a control, three wild type plants were also split into nine pots, and the pooled tissues from these plants were used to isolate three RNA samples. RNA was quantified and evaluated for purity using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).</p><p>Three pooled RNA samples, each from three independent T<sub>1</sub> plants, were used as biological replicates for the microarray. For each sample, 500 ng of total RNA was used for expression analysis on the custom-designed switchgrass cDNA chip Pvi_cDNAa520831 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Probe labeling using the IVT Express Kit, chip hybridization and scanning were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). Data normalization between chips was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) <xref rid="pone.0047399-Irizarry1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Gene selections, based on the Associative T-test <xref rid="pone.0047399-Dozmorov1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, were made using Matlab software (MathWorks, Natick, MA); this analysis method has been detailed in a previous report <xref rid="pone.0047399-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. To reduce the family-wide false positive rate, we used a Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold of 4.07977E-07. This value was derived from 0.05/N <xref rid="pone.0047399-Abdi1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, where N is the number of probes sets (122,556) on the chip. For hierarchical clustering, the z-scores for the expression values of selected genes were calculated and imported into MeV open software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org/mev/">http://www.tm4.org/mev/</ext-link>). Pearson's coefficient was used to calculate the similarity in expression patterns between genes.</p><p>The DNA sequences of the microarray probes that detected genes with altered expressions were used as queries for BLAST searching against the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) databases of both NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and the Switchgrass Functional Genomics Server hosted at the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://switchgrassgenomics.noble.org/">http://switchgrassgenomics.noble.org/</ext-link>) (updated in June 2011), as well as the switchgrass genome sequence database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/panicumvirgatum.php">http://www.phytozome.net/panicumvirgatum.php</ext-link>). Probe sets that showed similar expression patterns, as well as those that yielded the same hit to the database, were merged. A few probes detected genes of viral origin, possibly due to viral contamination of the plants. After the elimination of the repeated probes and the probes against virus sequences, a total of 104 switchgrass genes were shown to have altered expression levels between the WT and transgenic lines. The longest ESTs or probe target sequences of the 104 switchgrass hits were used to perform BLAST searches against the Genbank database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>).

However, we did not identify any known abaxial-adaxial cell fate-determining genes (e.g., <italic>KANADI</italic> family genes or BR-synthesis and signaling pathway genes) that could directly explain the erect leaf phenotype. The potential functional roles of several of these genes are discussed below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>
<italic>AtLOV1</italic> regulates flowering time in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and switchgrass</title><p>Previous reports suggested that the overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> delayed flowering time and enhanced cold tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In switchgrass breeding programs, the selection of cultivars with a delayed flowering phenotype is desirable because such cultivars may produce more biomass due to their extended vegetative growth. However, a prolonged growing period may compromise the winter survivability of these cultivars, especially if they are grown more than one hardiness zone north of their native range <xref rid="pone.0047399-VanEsbroeck2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Parrish1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Increased cold tolerance can improve the winter hardiness of lowland cultivars, which are sensitive to low temperatures in winter <xref rid="pone.0047399-Casler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Casler2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Therefore, the switchgrass homologs of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> may provide an opportunity for the genetic improvement of switchgrass germplasm. NAC transcription factors, including <italic>AtLOV1</italic>, have a conserved N-terminal NAC domain and a variable C-terminal transcriptional activation region (TAR) <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We BLAST searched against the current switchgrass EST database with the full-length NAC or TAR sequences of <italic>AtLOV1</italic>; no sequences with significant similarity to <italic>AtLOV1</italic> were identified in the switchgrass EST database. We also BLAST searched the rice and maize EST and genomic DNA databases, which allowed us to identify several AtLOV1 homologs. However, none of these genes have been previously characterized. Therefore, we are not sure which homologs are the actual orthologs of <italic>AtLOV1</italic>. Because we failed to identify a switchgrass ortholog of <italic>AtLOV1</italic>, we attempted to express <italic>AtLOV1</italic> directly in switchgrass. Our results demonstrated that <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass had delayed flowering, as has been described for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> negatively regulated the expression of <italic>FT</italic> and resulted in a late-flowering phenotype <xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our microarray and real time RT-PCR analyses also identified a gene homologous to the rice and <italic>Arabidopsis FT</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0047399-Tamaki1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> that was down-regulated by the expression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> in switchgrass (microarray probe ID: AP13CTG21204_at; corresponding EST GeneBank No. HO298851.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047399-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The down-regulation of this <italic>FT</italic>-like gene may contribute to the delayed flowering time phenotype in switchgrass, although the functions of the <italic>FT</italic>-like gene in switchgrass germplasm have not been characterized. Switchgrass flowering time, similarly to that of maize, is regulated by both photoperiod-dependent and autonomous pathways <xref rid="pone.0047399-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-VanEsbroeck2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Lawrence3" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-VanEsbroeck3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Therefore, the switchgrass <italic>FT</italic> homolog identified in our microarray analysis may have similar functions to the maize <italic>FT gene</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Direct manipulation of the <italic>FT</italic>-like gene may result in delayed flowering time in switchgrass.</p><p>The overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> increases cold tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, in this study, we failed to identify switchgrass genes with obvious homology to known cold-related genes through microarray analysis. The <italic>AtLov1</italic> transgenic plants were not obviously more cold resistant than the control plant (data not shown). It is possible that AtLOV1 regulates cold-related genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> but not in switchgrass <xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>
<italic>AtLOV1</italic> produces two alternatively spliced forms in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and switchgrass</title><p>The <italic>AtLOV1</italic> gene has been shown to be alternatively spliced, generating two transcript forms (ANAC034/035, or LOV1.1/1.2) in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and switchgrass, and both of these forms are localized to the nucleus (Figure S3). The phenotypes associated with <italic>AtLOV1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have been ascribed mainly to the longer transcript (<italic>AtLOV1.2</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, in our study, we used genomic DNA of the <italic>AtLOV1</italic> gene, capable of producing both transcripts, to transform the switchgrass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047399-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear if the phenotypes of the transgenic switchgrass plants were caused by the longer or shorter transcript of <italic>AtLOV1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Ectopic expression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> confers novel phenotypes in switchgrass</title><p>One of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, NAC proteins have been found to be key regulators of plant development and stress perception <xref rid="pone.0047399-Jensen2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. In this study, the overexpression of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC gene <italic>AtLOV1</italic> in switchgrass resulted in smaller leaf angles and increased lignin content. However, such phenotypes were not previously reported for the overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> or any other NAC transcription factor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Torii1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Masle1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Therefore, it is unclear if these phenotypes were due to the influence of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> on the same biological functions that it alters in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The transfer of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcription factor genes into crop plant species could result in unexpected phenotypes. For example, transgenic rice plants overexpressing the <italic>Arabidopsis SHN1</italic> gene showed greater cellulose and less lignin content in their cell wall biomass <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ambavaram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, whereas in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>SHN1</italic> was only reported to regulate the epicuticular wax content of leaf surfaces <xref rid="pone.0047399-Aharoni1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Despite the fact that the novel phenotypes of transgenic switchgrass or rice plants may not reflect the biological functions of the genes targeted in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the improved agronomic traits generated by transformation have significant applications in the genetic improvement of crop plants.</p><p>The genes regulated by <italic>AtLOV1</italic> in switchgrass could be revealed through the analysis of conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the promoters of the switchgrass genes identified in our microarray analysis (Supplemental data, Table S3) <xref rid="pone.0047399-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Direct manipulation of these targeted genes may generate desirable phenotypes useful to the breeding of switchgrass for biomass production. However, without a fully sequenced switchgrass reference genome, it is difficult to identify <italic>cis</italic>-elements at this time.</p><p>We used switchgrass microarrays for the global gene expression analysis of transgenic switchgrass plants. Because the erect leaf phenotype was most dramatic in the leaf and leaf collar regions, RNA was extracted from the leaf base, leaf collar and leaf sheath regions for the microarray analysis. Our results showed significantly altered expression of 104 switchgrass genes in response to the expression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> (supplemental data, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047399-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The microarray analysis identified 16 differentially expressed genes that are putatively related to plant development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047399-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). One up-regulated gene product (probe ID: AP13ITG40821_s_at; corresponding to EST No. HO250279.1) is homologous to the human <italic>Lateral Signaling Target Protein</italic>, which serves as a negative regulator of epidermal cell growth factor <xref rid="pone.0047399-Mosesson1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. However, the functions of plant homologs of this gene have not yet been characterized in any plant species. It will be interesting to study this switchgrass gene further and determine if it has a similar role in the regulation of leaf collar cells development.</p><p>Rice mutants with reduced brassinosteroid (BR) content or reduced BR-sensitivity were often severely dwarfed but had erect and dark green leaves <xref rid="pone.0047399-Sakamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Yamamuro1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass also had erect and dark green leaves (data not shown), and the heights of these plants were slightly shorter than those of the WT controls. However, global gene expression analysis did not identify any genes significantly homologous to known members of BR-related pathways (Table S3), suggesting either that an unidentified BR-independent genetic pathway contributed to the erect leaf phenotype or that <italic>AtLOV1</italic> directly targeted genes downstream of BR signaling that control leaf angle.</p><p>Leaf curling also impacts leaf angles, often via changes in leaf abaxial and/or adaxial cell fates <xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the density of abaxial epidermal cells is regulated by a group of genes within the <italic>YABBY</italic> and <italic>KANADI</italic> families <xref rid="pone.0047399-Eckardt1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047399-Eshed1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, while the adaxial cell identity is controlled by genes belonging to the HD-ZIP III family (e.g., <italic>PHB, PHV</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0047399-Emery1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Maize and rice <italic>KANADI</italic> family genes also function in defining the abaxial cell identity <xref rid="pone.0047399-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Candela1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. However, the leaves of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass lines were not severely curved (data not shown), suggesting that leaf curling was not a major contributing factor to the small leaf angle of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass. No genes homologous to those involved in abaxial or adaxial cell fate determination were identified in the microarray analysis.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> in switchgrass slightly increased the total lignin content of cell wall biomass (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047399-t002">Table 2</xref>). As a self-incompatible plant species, synthetic switchgrass cultivars have heterozygous genetic backgrounds, and most phenotypes are still segregating in a population of a given switchgrass cultivar. Therefore, it is difficult to find a perfect wild type control to compare phenotypically with transgenic plants, as every individual transgenic line has a slightly different genetic background. In this study, we attempted to measure the lignin content of a wild type control by pooling plant tissue from three individual wild plants, which we consider representative of the averaged lignin content of a switchgrass cultivar. We identified multiple independent <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic lines with slightly higher lignin contents than the averaged data of wild type control plants, suggesting that this lignin content increase was caused by the overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic>. However, this conclusion should be further validated by measuring the lignin contents of T<sub>1</sub> progenies derived from a single plant that are segregating of the transgene.</p><p>Although low lignin content is preferred for the biological conversion of lignocellulosic switchgrass feedstock to biofuel <xref rid="pone.0047399-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, biomass feedstock with high energy content and low mineral residues is highly desirable for other bioenergy production processes, such as pyrolysis and combustion <xref rid="pone.0047399-Boateng1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Through microarray analysis, we identified a number of differentially expressed genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism that include nine genes related to cell wall biosynthesis; among these genes, five were up-regulated and four were down-regulated. One up-regulated gene (probe ID: AP13ITG62738RC_at; EST No. FL891887.1) showed significant homology to the <italic>GP1</italic> that is involved in plant cell wall extension and biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0047399-Keskiaho1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Another up-regulated gene (probe ID: AP13ITG76341_at; EST No. FL759004.1) encoded a protein with a conserved cellulose synthase domain, although it was not clustered with other cellulose synthases in dicot species (data not shown). The biological functions of most switchgrass genes have not yet been characterized; therefore, we currently have no evidence if the gene (EST No. FL759004.1) actually encodes a functional cellulose enzyme and how it might contribute to the regulation of cell wall composition in <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass plants. Nevertheless, the candidate genes identified in this study could be directly manipulated in to the hope of altering the cell wall composition of switchgrass.</p><p>An erect leaf phenotype has been observed to contribute to greater biomass yield because it improves plant architecture through increased shade avoidance, maximizing plant biomass yield in a dense field population <xref rid="pone.0047399-Sakamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047399-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this report, <italic>AtLOV1</italic> plants had an erect phenotype; however, there was no significant difference between transgenic and non-transgenic switchgrass plants in terms of overall biomass yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047399-t004">Table 4</xref>). However, we were only able to measure the biomass yield of individual <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass plants grown in pots under greenhouse conditions, and it will be interesting to determine if <italic>AtLOV1</italic> plants actually produce more biomass under high planting density in the field. The expression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> slightly reduced plant height, which may have partially contributed to the slight decrease of the aboveground biomass yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047399-t004">Table 4</xref>). It is also possible that the overexpression of a transgene has a &#x0201c;penalty&#x0201d; for the transgenic plants, which could be triggered by any number of factors. By backcrossing the transgenic crop plants to wild type control plants, we may identify switchgrass plants with an optimum level of transgene expression that only carry valuable agronomic traits <xref rid="pone.0047399-Fu2" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Global gene expression analysis of the <italic>AtLOV1</italic> transgenic switchgrass plants</title><p>In this study, we identified switchgrass genes regulated by the overexpression of <italic>AtLOV1</italic> through microarray analysis. Further characterization of genes regulated by <italic>AtLOV1</italic> may help us unravel the genetic pathways underlying small leaf angle, cell wall biosynthesis, and flowering time. However, because only RNA transcript differences are detected by microarray analysis, the relationships between the genetic regulation and actual levels of active proteins for these pathways are unknown. Switchgrass is a polyploid plant with a large and complex genome, making it a difficult system in which to conduct reverse genetics studies <xref rid="pone.0047399-Parrish1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

Under greenhouse conditions, the overall biomass yield of transgenic switchgrass was not significantly different from that of non-transgenic plants; however, the <italic>AtLOV1</italic> plants may show an improvement over the wild type due to their erect leaves and delayed flowering phenotypes if they are grown under high-density field conditions.
