The NAC proteins, which include NAM, ATAF, and CUC, are a plant-specific transcription factor family with diverse roles in development and stress regulation. It has been reported that miR164 negatively regulates <italic>NAC1</italic> expression, which in turn affects lateral root development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; however, little is known about the involvement of the maize NAC family and miR164 in lateral root development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We collected 175 maize transcripts with NAC domains. Of these, 7 <italic>ZmNACs</italic> were putative targets for regulation by miR164. We isolated one gene, called <italic>TC258020</italic> (designated <italic>ZmNAC1</italic>) from 2 maize inbred lines, 87-1 and Zong3. <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> had a high expression level in roots and showed higher abundance (1.8 fold) in Zong3 relative to 87-1, which had less lateral roots than Zong3. There was a significant correlation between the expression level of <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> and the lateral root density in the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that overexpressed <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> had increased lateral roots in comparison to the wild type. These findings suggest that <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> played a significant role in lateral root development. An allelic expression assay showed that trans-regulatory elements were the dominant mediators of <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> differential expression in 87-1 and Zong3, and further analysis revealed that miR164 was a trans-element that guided the cleavage of endogenous <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> mRNA. Both mature miR164 and miR164 precursors had higher expression in 87-1 than Zong3, which was the opposite of the expression pattern of <italic>ZmNAC1</italic>. Additionally, the allelic assay showed that the cis-regulatory element most likely affected <italic>Zm-miR164b</italic>'s expression pattern. A &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) assay showed that the <italic>Zm-miR164b</italic> promoter had higher GUS activity in 87-1 than in Zong3. In addition, we detected miR164b expression in the RIL population, and the results indicated that miR164b had a higher expression level in the RILs containing 87-1 promoter than those containing Zong3 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate one possible pathway in maize by which differences in <italic>miR164b</italic> promoter activity resulted in a different expression pattern for mature miR164 which negatively regulates <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> expression in 87-1 and Zong3, thereby contributing to a significantly different lateral root phenotype.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Maize <italic>ZmNAC1</italic></kwd><kwd>miR164</kwd><kwd>Lateral root</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>NAC</italic> genes that encode plant-specific transcription factors influence a diverse set of developmental processes. The NAC family proteins contain a consensus sequence known as the NAC domain (petunia NAM and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ATAF1, ATAF2, and CUC2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which is located in the N-terminal region, but their C-terminal sequences are divergent in both length and amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. NAC proteins make up a large family, with a total of 109 and 140 predicted proteins identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Members of the NAC family seem to play different roles in plant development. For example, <italic>NAM</italic> from petunia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and <italic>CUC2</italic> of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (the first reported <italic>NAC</italic> genes) are involved in shoot apical meristem (SAM) development. By contrast, the <italic>Arabidopsis NAC</italic> gene <italic>CUC3</italic> has been reported to contribute to the establishment of the cotyledon boundary and the shoot meristem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Another <italic>Arabidopsis NAC</italic> gene called <italic>NAP</italic> (NAC-LIKE, activated by AP3/PI) has been characterized as the target of two MADS box genes, <italic>APETAL3</italic> and <italic>PISTILLATA</italic>, which control cell division and cell expansion in stamens and petals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>AtNAC1</italic> has been characterized as an intermediary in the auxin-signaling pathway that activates genes encoding molecules involved in the specification of lateral root initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, NAC proteins have been implicated in defense and abiotic stress responses. Some ATAF subfamily genes, including <italic>StNAC</italic> from tomato and <italic>AtAF1-2</italic> from <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> have been shown to be induced by pathogen attack and wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. More recently, some <italic>NAC</italic> genes such as <italic>BnNAC</italic> from <italic>Brassica</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>AtNAC072</italic> (RD26), <italic>AtNAC019</italic> and <italic>AtNAC055</italic> from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and <italic>SNAC1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>SNAC2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] from rice were found to be involved in the plant's response to various environmental stresses, including drought, salinity, and/or low temperature.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by guiding target mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miR164 can target five NAC domain-encoding mRNAs, including the <italic>NAC1, CUC1, CUC2, At5g07680,</italic> and <italic>At5g61430</italic> mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>NAC1</italic> is able to transmit auxin signals that promote lateral root emergence, and miR164 guides the cleavage of <italic>NAC1</italic> mRNA, which is followed by a mechanism to cleave <italic>NAC1</italic> mRNA and downregulate auxin signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Other groups have independently reported evidence for the miR164-mediated regulation of <italic>CUC1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>CUC2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which have been implicated in meristem development and the separation of aerial organs.</p><p>The process of lateral root (LR) development has been extensively studied in flowering plants and gymnosperms, and LRs begin in a specialized cell layer (called the pericycle) in the primary root (PR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and most other dicots, LRs are only formed from the pericycle cells that overlay the developing xylem tissue (the xylem pole pericycle). In other species, particularly cereals such as maize, rice and wheat, LRs arise specifically from the phloem pole pericycle, with additional contributions from the endodermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> a large body of evidence has indicated that auxin plays a pivotal role in lateral root development. Lateral root initiation begins with auxin-induced IAA14 degradation. This step allows the activation of <italic>ARF7</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic> transcription factors, which then activate the expression of <italic>LBD/ASL</italic> genes. The LBD/ASL proteins in turn activate cell cycle genes and cell patterning genes, allowing the formation of a new lateral root primordium (LRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition, auxin activates the transcription of <italic>NAC1</italic>, which upregulates the expression of two downstream auxin-responsive genes including <italic>DBP</italic> and <italic>AIR3</italic> to stimulate LR initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of NAC1 was also reported as follows: the role of miR164 expression in late auxin response was intended to clear <italic>NAC1</italic> mRNA, which would attenuate the auxin signaling that inhibits lateral root development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligase called SINAT5 promoted NAC1 ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation in order to attenuate the auxin response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, a miR164-targeted NAC domain gene that was designated <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> was isolated from maize. It was demonstrated that <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leads to increased number of lateral roots. Further study showed that miR164 is one of the trans-acting factors that negatively regulates <italic>ZmNAC1</italic>, resulting in a different <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> expression pattern between the two inbred lines 87-1 and Zong3, contributing to a significant difference in the lateral root phenotype between these two lines. Moreover, our analysis also indicated that the promoter variation of maize <italic>pri-miR164b</italic> in 87-1 and Zong3 might be one in which the dominant cis-element affects the expression of <italic>pri-miR164b,</italic> leading to differences in mature miR164 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of putative miR164-regulated NAC genes in maize</title><p>Putative NAC proteins in maize were identified using the conserved NAC domain sequences in a query that was performed by TBLASTN search.

These NAC proteins could be classified into 3 groups and 14 subgroups on the basis of their predicted NAC domain amino acid sequences (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

Because these genes showed a high degree of sequence conservation in the NAC domain, specific PCR primers were designed for the C-terminal region. The results indicated that <italic>TC258020</italic> and <italic>Zm020717</italic> had higher expression levels in their roots than in other analyzed tissues, whereas <italic>Zm020987</italic> and <italic>Zm390255026</italic> showed a lower expression level in the ears and stems than in other analyzed tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>Zm029753</italic> and <italic>Zm4253255028</italic> accumulated in all organs and developmental stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

An RNA gel blot of maize miRNA164 showed that the miR164 expression levels were higher in roots, leaf sheaths and male spikes than in other organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This pattern was similar to the pattern of miR164 expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, where miR164 accumulated more in its roots and inflorescences than in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Two &#x003bc;g of total RNA from each sample was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis in 20 &#x003bc;L reactions containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 50 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 200 U M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, USA) and 50 pmol T15 oligonucleotides. Reverse transcription was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min with a final denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min. Gene-specific RT-qPCR primers for 7 putative miR164 targets were designed according to the EST sequences. A 250 bp &#x003b2;-actin gene fragment was amplified as a positive control using the primer pair 5'-TGGCATTGTCAACAACTGG-3' and 5'-TCATTAGGTGGTCGGTGAGG-3'. PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;L containing 10 pmol primers, 10 mmol/L Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH8.5), 50 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 &#x003bc;L DMSO, 200 mmol/L dNTPs, 1 U Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian), and 0.5 &#x003bc;L SYBR GREEN I. The following PCR amplification protocol was used: 95&#x000b0;C (3 min) and 40 cycles of amplification cycle (95&#x000b0;C (30 s), 55&#x000b0;C (30 s),and 72&#x000b0;C (1 min)) using an Opticon PTC200 system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA). All reactions were run in triplicate, and no template and no reverse transcription controls were included. Quantification results were expressed in terms of the cycle threshold (CT) values according to the baseline, which was adjusted to 0.04. The comparative CT method (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to quantify gene expression in comparison with actin. In brief, the CT values were averaged for each triplicate. The differences between the mean CT value of a specific gene and that of &#x003b2;-actin was calculated as &#x00394;CT <sup>sample</sup> = CT<sup>gene</sup>-CT<sup>&#x003b2;-actin</sup>. In the final results, the sample's relative expression level was determined by 2<sup>-&#x00394;Ct</sup> method. Statistical significance was tested using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test (P &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of the miRNA-guided cleavage site</title><p>The GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen USA) was used for the RACE assay according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Total RNA was extracted from the roots of 87-1 seedlings, and Poly(A)mRNA was purified and ligated to the RLM-RACE 5'RACE RNA Oligo adaptor (5'-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-3'). The oligo (dT) (15-mer) primer was used for cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase, and the resultant cDNA was used for the first round of nested PCR using the 5' RACE primer 5'-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3' together with <italic>ZmNAC1</italic> gene-specific primer 5&#x02019;-ACCCAAGCCTCTTGTAGCACTCATC-3'. The 5' RACE nested primer 5'-GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGAT-3' and the gene-specific nested primer 5'-GTCGAGGCATTTCGATCCGCATC-3' were used for the second round of nested PCR. Gel-purified PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and sequenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Transformation vectors and construction of transgenic plants</title><p>For the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, constructs were made in the binary vector pCAMBIASuper1300. For the plasmid super-p: <italic>ZmNAC1</italic>, the forward primer (5'-GC<underline>TCTAGA</underline>CGCAGAAGTTGACCACGTAC-3') (the underlined sequence is the XbaI site) and the reverse primer (5'-GG<underline>GGTACC</underline>ATCCATCCTGTTATCGTCGAG-3') (the underlined sequence is the KpnI site) were designed to introduce XbaI and KpnI sites, and Zong3 root cDNA samples were used to amplify a 1463 bp cDNA from <italic>ZmNAC1</italic>. The construct was transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101. Six-week-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants were transformed via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation by the floral-dip method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Transgenic plants were selected on 1/2 MS medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing hygromycin B. T3 generation was used for further experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assay and GUS activity assay</title><p>The miR164b promoters from the inbred lines 87-1 and Zong3 were ligated into the Gateway pDONR 211Vector (Invitrogen USA), and then the vector miR164b-87-1promoter:: GUS and miR164b-Zong3promoter::GUS construct made according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Two primers in different orientations (5'-<underline>CAAAAAAGCAGGCT</underline>GTGATTGACGACAACATGAACAAATC-3',5'-<underline>ACAAGAAAGCTGGG</underline>TCGCAATTCTCGAATTCACCTTC-3'; the underlined sequence is the attB1 and attB2 site) were used to amplify the promoter sequences from 87-1 and Zong3 in separate DNA samples. Agrobacterium GV3101 that harbored each of the promoter:GUS constructs was grown on yeast extract peptone medium (10 g yeast extract, 10 g Bacto peptone, 5 g NaCl, and 15 g agar/l) supplemented with rifampicin (60 &#x003bc;g/mL), kanamycin (50 &#x003bc;g/mL) and spectinomycin (100&#x003bc;g/mL). Agrobacterium was cultured at 28&#x000b0;C and harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 6,000 g, re-suspended in infiltration media (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM MES containing 150 mM acetosyringone) for 2 h at room temperature to induce T-DNA transfer functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and then adjusted to an OD600 of 0.8. After the infiltration of the Agrobacterium suspension into the abaxial surfaces of tobacco leaves from a syringe without a needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the tobacco plants were maintained in a moist chamber at 26&#x000b0;C for 48 h for GUS activity analysis.</p><p>GUS activity in these tobacco leaves was measured as described by Jefferson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Tobacco leaf tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) sodium laurylsarcosine, 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, and 6 mM L-ascorbic acid). After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm (4&#x000b0;C), the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microtube. The spectrophotometric reaction was carried out in a 1 mL volume with 1 mM PNPG (P-nitrophenyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucuronide) in the extraction buffer supplemented with protein extract supernatants. GUS activity was normalized to the protein concentration in each of the crude extracts and was expressed as nmol of P-nitrophenol min/mg protein. The total protein in the sample extract was quantified using bovine serum albumin as a standard, according to the Bradford method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The GUS measurement was repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR analysis using the WAVE dHPLC system</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used gene-specific primers (5'-CAGCTCCACACCTGTACGT-3' and 5'-CCATGCTCAGCGACTTGATG-3' for <italic>ZmNAC1</italic>, and 5'-ACGTGCATTACCATCCAATGC-3', 5'-CTGCATGACGAGGTATGTACG-3' for <italic>ZmmiR164b</italic>) to obtain the corresponding cDNA from each inbred line by RT-PCR. The PCR products were then sequenced to identify allele-specific sequence polymorphisms between the inbred lines 87-1 and Zong3 that would allow separation of the two parental alleles on the WAVE dHPLC system (Transgenomic, Omaha, NE). The gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the regions that are conserved between alleles and that encompass a sequence polymorphism indel to minimize the amplification preference of either allele and to optimize the amplicon for WAVE analysis. The &#x003b2;-actin gene fragment was amplified as a positive control using 26 cycles. Three PCR replicates were performed for each RNA sample. The RT-PCR products were then separated and quantified by the WAVE dHPLC system, and detailed WAVE dHPLC analysis was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Jing Li and Guanghui Guo carried out the main experiments and drafted the manuscript, and they contributed equally to this study.
