<italic>ANTHER INDEHISCENCE FACTOR</italic> (<italic>AIF</italic>), a <italic>NAC</italic>-like gene, was identified in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> In <italic>AIF:GUS</italic> flowers, &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected in the anther, the upper parts of the filaments, and in the pollen of stage 7&#x02013;9 young flower buds; GUS activity was reduced in mature flowers. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)+AIF-C fusion proteins, which lacked a transmembrane domain, accumulated in the nuclei of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells, whereas the YFP+AIF fusion proteins accumulated in the membrane and were absent in the nuclei. Further detection of a cleaved AIF protein in flowers revealed that AIF needs to be processed and released from the endoplasmic reticulum in order to function. The ectopic expression of <italic>AIF-C</italic> caused a male-sterile phenotype with indehiscent anthers throughout flower development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The presence of a repressor domain in AIF and the similar phenotype of indehiscent anthers in <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants suggest that <italic>AIF</italic> acts as a repressor. The defect in anther dehiscence was due to the down-regulation of genes that participate in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, such as <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic>. The external application of JA rescued the anther indehiscence in <italic>AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers. In <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> plants, which are transgenic dominant-negative mutants in which <italic>AIF</italic> is converted to a potent activator via fusion to a VP16-AD motif, the anther dehiscence was promoted, and the expression of <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic> was up-regulated. Furthermore, the suppression of <italic>AIF</italic> through an antisense strategy resulted in a mutant phenotype similar to that observed in the <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> flowers. The present data suggest a role for <italic>AIF</italic> in controlling anther dehiscence by suppressing the expression of JA biosynthesis genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Anther dehiscence</kwd><kwd><italic>ANTHER INDEHISCENCE FACTOR</italic></kwd><kwd>jasmonate signalling</kwd><kwd><italic>NAC</italic>-like gene</kwd><kwd>repressor.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anther dehiscence is an essential process in which mature pollen grains are released from the locules of the anther, thus enabling pollination.

Mutations in genes that participate in JA biosynthesis cause a failure or delay in anther dehiscence and can result in male sterility. Examples of these genes include the <italic>DEFECTIVE IN ANTHER DEHISCENCE 1</italic> (<italic>DAD1</italic>) gene, which encodes a phospholipase A1 that catalyses the initial step of JA biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ishiguro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>); <italic>AOS</italic>, a gene that encodes allene oxide synthase (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">von Malek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>); <italic>DEHISCENCE 1</italic> (<italic>DDE1</italic>)/<italic>OPR3</italic>, which encodes the OPR protein 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase in the JA synthesis pathway (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Stintzi and Browse, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Ma, 2005</xref>); and the triple mutation (<italic>fad3 fad7 fad8</italic>) of genes encoding fatty acid desaturases that catalyse the desaturation of linoleic acid to form linolenic acid (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">McConn and Browse, 1996</xref>). In addition, similar phenotypes have been observed in <italic>coronatine insensitive 1</italic> (<italic>coi1</italic>) mutants, which are insensitive to JA (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Feys <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), indicating that JA is specifically required for anther dehiscence during anther development. JA has been thought to control dehiscence by regulating water transport in the filament and anther because mutants defective in JA synthesis have much less water loss in anther tissues than do non-mutants (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ishiguro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Ma, 2005</xref>). However, only a few works have described a possible mechanism by which the regulation of JA activity is associated with anther dehiscence (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Nagpal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). One of these works describes two auxin response factors, ARF6 and ARF8, in auxin signalling that are thought to play roles in regulating JA production (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Nagpal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition, auxin has been thought to control anther dehiscence by regulating both JA biosynthesis and endothecium lignification (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Cecchetti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Recently, a report described a RING-type E3 ligase that regulates anther dehiscence by activating the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway gene <italic>DAD1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating JA activity during anther dehiscence are still to be elucidated.</p><p content-type="indent">NAC is a domain that is named for the three genes first described to contain the domain: <italic>NO APICAL MERISTEM</italic> (<italic>NAM</italic>) of petunia and <italic>ATAF1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> and <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 2</italic> (<italic>CUC2</italic>) of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Souer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).

<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> reported that a group of membrane-bound NAC transcription factors (designated NTLs) are transported into the nucleus to regulate the expression of downstream genes after release from the membranes. Because AIF is predicted to be a member of the NTL family, which contains a transmembrane domain in the C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), it is possible that AIF may also be processed and released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enter the nucleus to perform its function. To test this hypothesis, the proteins that were isolated from wild-type flowers were used to perform a western blot analysis with an anti-AIF antibody. If the AIF protein was processed and released from the ER in young flower buds, only a cleaved 40kDa AIF-C would be detected by the anti-AIF antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As expected, this band was clearly obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, as proposed, the AIF protein must be processed and released from the ER in the young flower buds of wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to perform its function. To test further the specificity of the anti-AIF antibody and the processing of the AIF proteins, transgenic plants that ectopically expressed the full-length AIF were further generated and the proteins from these <italic>35S:AIF+GFP</italic> transgenic flowers were isolated in order to perform a western blot analysis using the anti-AIF antibody. Two bands, a 40kDa AIF-C (cleaved) and an 87kDa AIF+GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein (uncleaved), were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). The detection of the 40kDa AIF-C band demonstrates that the transgenic as well as endogenous AIF protein was processed and released from the ER in floral buds in the <italic>35S:AIF+GFP</italic> transgenic plants. The detection of the 87kDa AIF+GFP band indicates that some transgenic AIF proteins were most probably not processed and released from the ER in the mature flowers in the <italic>35S:AIF+GFP</italic> transgenic plants.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Detection of AIF proteins in flowers and the localization of AIF proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts.

The expression of each gene was relative to that in the wild-type plant, which was set at 1. Error bar represents the standard deviation. Each experiment was repeated twice with similar results. For <italic>At5g04410</italic> expression: WT=1&#x000b1;0.094, Anti-1=0.11&#x000b1;0.024, Anti-2=0.78&#x000b1;0.058. For <italic>AIF</italic> expression: WT=1&#x000b1;0.143, Anti-1=0.13&#x000b1;0.015, Anti-2=0.30&#x000b1;0.022. For <italic>DAD1</italic> expression: WT=1&#x000b1;0.167, Anti-1=4.30&#x000b1;0.507, Anti-2=2.95&#x000b1;0.439.

This finding indicates that the pollen from the antisense flowers was able to function when it reached the stigmatic papillae. The viability of the antisense pollen was further confirmed by SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">K</xref>). Furthermore, the level of the <italic>DAD1</italic> transcripts was also up-regulated in the flower buds of the antisense plants before stage 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10C</xref>), similar to what occurred in the <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> flowers. Interestingly, the increase in the <italic>DAD1</italic> transcripts correlated with the decrease in the <italic>AIF</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, one gene, <italic>AIF</italic>, containing a NAC domain with an unknown function, was identified from and characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The ectopic expression of <italic>AIF-C</italic> caused a male-sterile phenotype with indehiscent anthers throughout flower development. It was therefore surmised that the function of the <italic>AIF</italic> gene is related to the regulation of anther dehiscence.</p><p content-type="indent">This hypothesis was supported by the expression pattern of the <italic>AIF</italic> gene during flower development. GUS activity was detected in the anthers, the upper part of the filaments, and the pollen of the stamen of the <italic>AIF:GUS</italic> flower buds at stages 7&#x02013;11 and was significantly decreased in mature flowers after stage 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). It is reasonable to suggest that the function of the <italic>AIF</italic> gene is to inhibit anther dehiscence during the early stages of flower development. When <italic>AIF</italic> expression decreased after maturation, this inhibition no longer occurred, thereby permitting anther dehiscence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). The identification of a conserved repressor NARD domain in AIF, as well as the similar deficiency in anther dehiscence in <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> transgenic plants, indicates that <italic>AIF</italic> acts as a repressor controlling anther dehiscence. Thus, the ectopic expression of <italic>AIF</italic> in <italic>35S:AIF-</italic>C and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants extends its influence into the late stages of flower development and results in anther dehiscence inhibition throughout flower development.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F11" position="float"><label>Fig. 11.</label><caption><p>Model for the function of <italic>AIF</italic> in regulating stamen development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The gradient of <italic>AIF</italic> activity is illustrated by the gradual reduction in the size of the grey triangle during flower maturation. In wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the high expression of <italic>AIF</italic> and processing and release of AIF-C from the ER suppressed (&#x02014;|) the expression of genes that participate in JA biosynthesis, such as <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOCs</italic>/<italic>OPR3/OPCL1</italic>, and the JA production in anthers during early flower development and resulted in the inhibition of anther dehiscence. During late flower development, the decrease of the <italic>AIF</italic> expression to a threshold level activated the expression of <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOCs</italic>/<italic>OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic> and increased (&#x02192;) the JA production in the stamen. This caused the initiation (&#x02192;) of anther dehiscence and resulted in the release of the normal mature pollen of wild-type flowers. In <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> or antisense plants, the expression of <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOCs</italic>/<italic>OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic> in stamen was activated during early flower development and resulted in a high level of JA production and ultimately caused early anther dehiscence. In contrast, in <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants, the expression of <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOCs</italic>/<italic>OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic> and the production of JA were suppressed by the high expression of AIF-C during all stages of flower development. This suppression prevented anther dehiscence and the release of pollen throughout flower development. The dashed (- - -) line/arrow indicates the pathways not activated in wild-type flowers.

<italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> plants (with or without +SRDX) produce the indehiscence phenotype. Clearly, AIF needs to be processed and released from the ER and must enter the nucleus to perform its function. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the full-length AIF protein is not able to enter the nucleus, whereas the AIF-C protein (without the transmembrane domain) can. The fact that only the cleaved AIF-C protein was detected in wild-type flowers using an anti-AIF antibody indicates that AIF is processed and released from the ER in young flower buds. In the <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> transgenic plants, the AIF-C protein that lacked the transmembrane domain could constitutively enter the nucleus during all stages of flower development, resulting in the constitutive suppression of anther dehiscence.</p><p content-type="indent">The function of <italic>AIF</italic> was further revealed by the analysis of <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> dominant-negative mutations. Interestingly, the anthers of the <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> flowers were prematurely dehiscent at early stage 10. This early-dehiscent phenotype was opposite to that of the <italic>35S:AIF-</italic>C and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers, which showed anther indehiscence. Furthermore, a similar early-dehiscent phenotype was also observed in the loss-of-function mutants that were generated by an antisense strategy in which <italic>AIF</italic> and putatively redundant genes were simultaneously suppressed. These results further support the assumption that <italic>AIF</italic> functions as a transcriptional repressor to prevent anther dehiscence during the early stages of floral development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). When the function of the <italic>AIF</italic> gene was altered in the <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> mutants, this inhibition was reversed, resulting in significantly earlier anther dehiscence. Furthermore, this result also indicates that the VP16 activation domain that was used in this study is sufficient to overcome the NARD repressor domain in <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> transgenic plants.</p><p content-type="indent">One interesting and critical task is to determine the exact role of <italic>AIF</italic> in the negative regulation of anther dehiscence. The phenotype of the indehiscent anthers in <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers resembled that of plants with mutations in genes that participate in JA biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ishiguro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, the transcript levels of several genes that participate in JA biosynthesis, such as <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3/OPCL1</italic>, were down-regulated in <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants. Thus, these genes are likely to function downstream of <italic>AIF</italic>. This hypothesis was further supported by the up-regulation of these genes (<italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3/OPCL1</italic>) in <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> and antisense mutants, in which anther dehiscence was promoted. These results indicate that <italic>AIF</italic> probably controls anther dehiscence by negatively regulating both the expression of genes that participate in JA biosynthesis and the level of JA. This hypothesis was further supported by two lines of evidence. First, similarities were observed between the <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants and the <italic>dad1</italic> mutants as follows: defective pollen, short filaments, and non-dehiscent anthers. The <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants appeared to produce more viable pollen than did the <italic>dad1</italic> mutants. In addition, filament elongation seems not to be completely affected in the <italic>AIF-C</italic> or <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers. The short filament was indeed produced in some (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8O</xref>) but not all <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results were probably due to the incomplete down-regulation of <italic>DAD1</italic> and other genes that participate in JA biosynthesis in <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants. Thus, not all of the JA-regulated processes in the flowers will be completely affected in the <italic>AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers, as seen in the present results. Secondly, the external application of JA not only rescued the non-dehiscence of the anthers but also restored the defects of the pollen and caused the elongation of the silique and the production of seeds in the <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers. These results were similar to those observed in the <italic>dad1</italic> mutant flowers (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ishiguro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The present results reveal a possible model for the interaction of <italic>AIF</italic> and JA in regulating anther dehiscence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>. In wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a high level of <italic>AIF</italic> expression and the constitutive processing and release of AIF-C from the ER in the anthers and the upper part of the filaments during early stamen development suppressed <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic> gene expression and JA production and prevented early anther dehiscence. During late flower development, <italic>AIF</italic> expression was significantly reduced and was not sufficient to suppress <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3</italic>/<italic>OPCL1</italic> expression. Thus, these genes were activated, and JA production was increased in the stamen, resulting in the initiation of anther dehiscence and the release of mature pollen. In the <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> dominant-negative mutant or antisense plants, <italic>AIF</italic> was either converted into an activator or suppressed during early flower development, resulting in the early activation of these genes and a high level of JA production in the stamens. Thus, early anther dehiscence occurred, and pollen was released. In contrast, in the <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants, the expression of <italic>DAD1/AOS/AOC3/OPR3/OPCL1</italic> and the production of JA were suppressed due to the high level of <italic>AIF-C</italic> or <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> expression during all stages of flower development. The suppression of these genes caused anther indehiscence throughout flower development, similar to that observed in the <italic>dad1</italic> and <italic>opr3</italic> mutants.</p><p content-type="indent">In addition to <italic>AIF</italic>, it has been previously reported that several <italic>NAC</italic>-like genes are also involved in the regulation of male sterility in plants. For example, double mutants of two <italic>NAC</italic>-like genes, <italic>NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1</italic> (<italic>NST1</italic>) and <italic>NST2</italic>, caused male sterility with a similar anther-indehiscent phenotype to that of <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> plants (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, <italic>NST1</italic> and <italic>NST2</italic> regulate secondary wall thickening in various tissues, and the anther dehiscence that was observed in the <italic>nst1/nst2</italic> double mutants was due to the loss of secondary wall thickening in the anther endothecium (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), which is completely different from the <italic>AIF</italic>-regulated mechanism. Transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing an RNAi (RNA interference) construct targeting the rice <italic>NAC</italic>-like gene <italic>Os07g37920</italic> produced reduced proportions of viable pollen grains and did not undergo anther dehiscence (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Distelfeld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This result indicates that the function of <italic>Os07g37920</italic> is the promotion of anther dehiscence, which is opposite to that of <italic>AIF</italic>. The precise molecular mechanisms regulated by <italic>Os07g37920</italic> during anther dehiscence remain to be elucidated. Thus, the unique characteristics of <italic>AIF</italic> in regulating anther dehiscence and JA biosynthesis found in this study provide useful information for understanding the additional functions of the <italic>NAC</italic>-like genes in regulating anther dehiscence and male sterility in plants.</p><p content-type="indent">In summary, one <italic>NAC</italic>-like gene, <italic>AIF</italic>, was characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The possible function of <italic>AIF</italic> in regulating the early development of the anther is supported by the early anther dehiscence in <italic>AIF-C+VP16</italic> transgenic dominant-negative mutant and loss-of-function antisense plants and by anther indehiscence in <italic>35S:AIF-C</italic> and <italic>AIF-C+SRDX</italic> flowers. This result indicates the importance of <italic>AIF</italic> in preventing anther dehiscence during early flower development. Furthermore, the present data provide evidence for a mechanism that functions upstream of JA signalling during anther dehiscence. In this mechanism, it was found that <italic>AIF</italic> needs to be processed and released from the ER to regulate anther dehiscence negatively by suppressing genes that participate in JA biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s28"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
