It was identified from rice and overexpressed in cotton cultivar YZ1 by <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation. <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing cotton plants showed more vigorous growth, especially in terms of root development, than the wild-type plants in the presence of 250 mM NaCl under hydroponic growth conditions. The content of proline was enhanced but the MDA content was decreased in the transgenic cotton seedlings under drought and salt treatments compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing cotton plants also displayed significantly improved tolerance to both drought and salt stresses in the greenhouse. The performances of the <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing lines under drought and salt stress were significantly better than those of the wild-type in terms of the boll number. During the drought and salt treatments, the transpiration rate of transgenic plants significantly decreased in comparison to the wild-type, but the photosynthesis rate maintained the same at the flowering stage in the transgenic plants. These results suggested that overexpression of <italic>SNAC1</italic> improve more tolerance to drought and salt in cotton through enhanced root development and reduced transpiration rates.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National High-Tech Program of China (2013AA102601-4) and the project from Ministry of Agriculture of China (2013ZX08005-004).

Climate models indicated that abiotic stresses would increase in the near future because of global climate change <xref rid="pone.0086895-Ahuja1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Therefore, drought and salinity would be the two major factors that adversely affect crop growth and productivity. Cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum L</italic>.) is an important commercial crop worldwide, and used as a source of fiber and edible oil. Cotton showed higher drought and salt tolerance than other major crops such as rice, wheat and maize. Although that, abiotic stress still greatly affected cotton in growth and yield. Farmers plan to enlarge the planted area of cotton in western China, which is not suitable for food crops because of salinity and water shortage. Therefore, improved drought and salt tolerance of cotton through biotechnology has become an urgent task.</p><p>The NAC transcription factors have been characterized for their roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. NAC was originally derived from the names of the first three proteins containing NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF1-2 and CUC2 (cup-shaped cotyledon), that contain a similar DNA-binding domain. NAC proteins appeared to be widespread in plants such as Arabidopsis, rice, wheat, soya bean and cotton <xref rid="pone.0086895-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Puranik1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and comprised a large plant-specific family, which included 110 members in Arabidopsis and 140 members in rice, and only a few had been identified with diverse functions in plants <xref rid="pone.0086895-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Recently, Several studies reported that a subfamily of NAC transcription factors played a pivotal role in various abiotic stresses including salinity, drought and low temperature <xref rid="pone.0086895-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Hao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previous works indicated that the overexpression of <italic>ANAC019</italic>, <italic>ANAC055</italic>, and <italic>ANAC072</italic> caused increased drought tolerance in transgenic plants through changing the transcription of a limited number of non-specific salt- and drought-responsive genes <xref rid="pone.0086895-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Bu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The overexpression of <italic>SNAC1</italic> in rice was another important example, which enhanced salt and drought tolerance and grain yield in the field test <xref rid="pone.0086895-Hu2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Recent results showed that overexpression of <italic>OsNAC5</italic> significantly enlarged roots and enhanced drought tolerance and grain yield under field conditions, as well <xref rid="pone.0086895-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. At present, improved drought and salt tolerance could also be achieved by the overexpression of diverse NAC factors in species ranging from Arabidopsis, rice, chickpea, wheat, and tomato <xref rid="pone.0086895-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Yokotani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Constitutive overexpression of NAC gene in transgenic plants occasionally led to detrimental consequences such as dwarfing, late flowering and lower seed yield, which could be overcomed by preferentially employed stress-inducible or tissue-specific promoters such as <italic>OsNAC6</italic> or <italic>RCc3</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0086895-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086895-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus, the research gave the evident functional of stress-responsive NAC genes, a meticulous characterization of their response to abiotic stress is crucial in conferring broad stress tolerance to plants.</p><p>A previous study suggested that <italic>SNAC1</italic>, which encoded an NAC transcription factor, was predominantly induced in guard cells by drought in rice. Further results showed that <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpression in rice significantly improved drought tolerance under field conditions and strong tolerance to salt stress. The increased drought tolerance might be partly explained by the reduced transpiration rate and an increased sensitivity to ABA. In addition, <italic>SNAC1</italic> overexpression did not result in unwanted dwarf phenotype in transgenic rice <xref rid="pone.0086895-Hu2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It was also important to be considered that the new transgenic lines with acquired stress-resistance phenotypes did not cause yield penalty and/or growth retardation. And breeders might be able to use <italic>SNAC1</italic> to increase stress tolerance by employing biotechnology in rice <xref rid="pone.0086895-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It was unclear whether <italic>SNAC1</italic> could be employed in other crops to improve tolerance to abiotic stress.</p><p>We reported that ectopic <italic>SNAC1</italic> expression in cotton led to improved drought and salt tolerance at the vegetative and reproductive stages in transgenic plants. Our results also showed that <italic>SNAC1-</italic>overexpression significantly enlarged root biomass and increased the boll number during drought and salt treatment in the greenhouse. This findings implied that <italic>SNAC1</italic> in improving agronomic traits and economic characteristics of cotton by ectopic expression would be an efficient way to accelerate the cotton breeding program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Vector Construction and Cotton Transformation</title><p>The full-length of <italic>SNAC1</italic> from rice was kindly donated by Professor Lizhong Xiong (Huazhong Agricultural University).

The eighteen-day-old plants were grown in a greenhouse and then subjected to drought and salt stress. For the control conditions, every tub container received 4000 ml of water. For drought stress, the plants were subjected to water stress by withholding half the water for two weeks. For salt stress, plants were watered with 250 mM NaCl solution for two weeks.

Samples weighing approximately 100 mg were collected from the first fully expanded leaf of stressed (drought-stress and salt-stress) or control plants, and they were then placed in 10 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 3 ml of 3% sulfosalicylic acid for grinding. Ground samples were centrifuged, and 1 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of acid ninhydrin solution (1.25 g ninhydrin in 30 ml of glacial acetic acid and 20 ml of 6 M phosphoric acid) and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid in a fresh glass tube.

These plants were allowed to grow under normal conditions until the budding stage, and uniform plants were then divided into three groups: a well-watered control group, a drought stress group and a salt stress group. Each group consisted of eighteen plants. Stress treatment was applied at the budding and flowering stages. During the budding stage, the well-watered plants were irrigated with 2000 ml of water every ten days.

For the salt stress group, plants were irrigated with 2000 ml of 100 mM NaCl solution every ten days for 20 days.

Moreover, transgenic lines S-1 and S-4 had considerably larger shoots and roots than those of the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086895-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), particularly transgenic line S-4, which produced significantly more shoot and root biomass than the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086895-g002">Figure 2C, D</xref>). The S-1 and S-4 lines produced 12% and 59% more dry shoot mass and 9% and 38% more dry root mass, respectively, compared to the wild-type plants under the salt treatment.

<italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing and wild-type plants were grown under drought and salt treatment conditions to examine stress tolerance in soil. At two-leaf stage, each plant was transplanted into a large plastic container containing fifteen pots with five pots for each line and one plant in every pot. All the plants of transgenic lines S-1, S-4 and wild-type plants were divided into three groups including normal, drought and salt treatments. All of the wild-type and transgenic plants grew well under normal conditions. While, the leaves of the wild-type plants withered more significantly than the transgenic lines after two weeks treatment of drought stress. The leaves of S-1 experienced medium wilting, and the leaves of S-4 showed slight wilting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086895-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Under salt treatment, transgenic lines S-1 and S-4 shrank slightly, but the wild-type plants clearly withered and had shrunken leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086895-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, we also estimated the levels of osmoprotectants such as proline and MDA in the leaves of wild-type and transgenic plants in response to different treatments. No significantly different in proline content was observed between the wild-type and transgenic plants under normal conditions. Under the drought and salt treatments, the content of proline was elevated in all of the plants, but it was remarkedly higher in two transgenic lines. Under drought treatment, the proline content increased up to 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold in the S-1 and S-4 transgenic lines, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of the wild-type plants. Similar results were also found in the two transgenic lines with 1.2-fold and 2.4-fold in proline content, which was significantly higher than that in the wild-type plants, after 250 mM NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086895-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0086895-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0086895.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Detection of stress tolerance in <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpression transgenic plants at the seedling stage.</title><p>(A): Phenotype of wild-type and <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing transgenic plants under normal conditions; (B): Phenotype of wild-type and <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing transgenic plants after two weeks of drought stress; (C): Phenotype of wild-type and <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing transgenic plants after two weeks of salt stress with a 250 mmol/L NaCl solution; (D): Proline content analysis under normal conditions and stress treatments; (E): MDA content analysis under normal conditions and stress treatments; WT: wild-type plant; S-1: <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpression transgenic plant from transgenic line S-1; S-4: <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpression transgenic plant from transgenic line S-4. *statistically significant at 5%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0086895.g003"/></fig><p>A remarkable high level of MDA was detected in the wild-type and transgenic plants after drought and salt treatment when compared with the normal condition plants.

<italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpression Increases Cotton Tolerance to Drought and Salt Stress in the Greenhouse</title><p>To evaluate the drought and salt tolerance of transgenic cotton at the budding and flowering stages, transgenic and wild-type plants were subjected to drought and salt stress in greenhouse.

When the plants were subjected to stress for twenty days at the flowering stage, the photosynthesis and stomatal conductance values decreased greatly under drought or salt stress treatments in all plants.

In our study, transgenic cotton grew much better than wide-type plants in the presence of 250 mM NaCl under hydroponic growth conditions. The increased salinity tolerance was measured by quantifying the biomass of cotton plants. The dry shoot and dry root masses of all <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing seedlings were significantly higher than those of wild-type plants grown under 250 mM NaCl conditions. In particular, the dry root masses of transgenic S-4 seedlings were higher than those of wild-type seedlings.

The dry biomasses of both the shoots and roots of the <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing plants were significantly higher than those of the wide-type plants. In rice, <italic>SNAC1</italic>-overexpressing plants were no different from wild-type plants in terms of root depth and volume.
