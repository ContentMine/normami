Genome-wide gene expression analysis at six hours of heat stress identified 29,896 differentially expressed genes (15,670 up-regulated and 14,226 down-regulated), including multiple classes of transcription factors. These interact with each other and regulate the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in response to heat stress, controlling carbon fixation and changes in stomatal conductance. Heat stress of more than twelve hours caused reduced electron transport, damaged photosystems, activated the glycolate pathway and caused H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production; as a result, photosynthetic capacity did not recover completely.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides a systematic physiological and global gene expression profile of the poplar photosynthetic response to heat stress and identifies the main limitations and threshold of photosynthesis under heat stress.

As the most intricate physiological process in plants, photosynthesis incorporates numerous components, including CO<sub>2</sub> reduction pathways, photosynthetic photosystems and the electron transport system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among these, Photosystem II (PSII) has been described as the most heat-sensitive component of the photosynthetic apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In <italic>Populus euphratica</italic>, heat stress causes a decrease in PSII abundance and an increase of Photosystem I (PSI); it also induces photosynthetic linear electron flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Sharkey et al. (2005) reported that reduction of plastoquinone and cyclic electron flow can be stimulated by moderate heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moderate heat stress also causes a reduction in Rubisco activities. The Rubisco oxygenase side reaction promotes the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which can be toxic to plant cells.</p><p>Transitory or constant high temperature causes morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes that reduce photosynthesis and thus limit plant growth and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moderate heat stress causes a reversible reduction of photosynthesis; increased heat stress causes irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, resulting in greater inhibition of plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], predicts that the Earth&#x02019;s climate will warm by 2&#x02013;4&#x000b0;C by the end of the 21st Century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the response of photosynthetic physiology and related gene expression under heat stress may help to improve the thermostability of plants and limit the adverse effects of climate change on crop yield.</p><p>Many studies have examined the effects of stress on the electron transport system, photosystems, pigments, photosynthesis-related enzyme activities, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These studies have mostly focused on the adaptive responses of plants to heat stress, but less attention has been paid to the recovery capacity of plants under stress. Trees, with their long lifetimes, must periodically contend with fluctuating environmental conditions. Thus, they have evolved specific physiological mechanisms to adapt to natural changes in environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Analysis of the adaption response and recovery capacity of trees to heat stress will expand our understanding of thermostability in all plants.</p><p>Most adaptive responses function, at least in part, through control of gene expression; therefore, heat-responsive transcription factors might play a critical role in abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Multiple genes interacting with each other and with the environment act in the responses to heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. bZIP (Basic Leucine Zipper) transcription factors have broad functions in plant biotic and abiotic stress responses, light signaling, and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) family transcription factors have been implicated in the activation of expression of <italic>EARLY RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION STRESS 1</italic> (<italic>ERD1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and are predominantly induced by abiotic stress in guard cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>MYB</italic> gene family members function in ABA signaling, and in jasmonic acid-related gene expression, indicating that they affect crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. CBF/DREB1 (C Repeat Binding Factor/Drought Response Element Binding 1) family members activate the expression of genes related to the production of osmoprotectants and antioxidants and their expression is quickly and transiently induced by abiotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The numbers and expression of genes involved in regulation of photosynthesis in trees in response to heat stress remains unclear. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify and analyze genes involved in high temperature tolerance in trees.</p><p>The advantages of using members of the poplar genus (<italic>Populus</italic>) as genomic models for tree molecular biology have been extensively reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Among <italic>Populus</italic> species, <italic>P. simonii</italic> shows remarkable survival capability, even in extreme temperatures (-41&#x000b0;C to +43&#x000b0;C) and other abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recent work reported the genome-wide gene expression profiles of the <italic>P. simonii</italic> responses to chilling and drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, information on the genome-wide transcriptome response of <italic>P. simonii</italic> to heat stress remains limited. Therefore, we selected <italic>P. simonii</italic> to examine the mechanisms of heat-tolerance in poplar. Our study presents a systematic investigation of differentially expressed genes in heat-stressed <italic>P. simonii</italic>. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes may be suitable targets for biotechnological manipulation to improve heat tolerance in poplar and other species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and treatments</title><p><italic>P. simonii</italic> samples were collected from Huzhu County of Qinghai Province, northwest China.

As the most fundamental physiological process in plants, photosynthesis provides essential energy for plant growth and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Damage to photosynthesis components may transiently or permanently reduce the overall photosynthetic capacity of a plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To understand the effects of high temperature on photosynthesis, we measured physiological, biochemical, chlorophyll fluorescence characters and examined changes in the transcriptome in this study.</p><sec><title>Effects of high temperature on photosynthesis</title><p>Photosynthesis has been long recognized as sensitive to environment stresses. Pn decreases if environmental stress affects any component of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our study revealed that photosynthesis significantly decreased after three hours heat stress and subsequently increased at six hours. The main cause of the reduced Pn may be the changes in Gs and Ci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. If both Ci and Gs decrease simultaneously, stomatal conductance will mainly limit Pn. By contrast, if Ci increased, but Gs decreased or did not change, the decrease of Pn might be caused by non-stomatal factors. At three hours high temperature treatment, Gs and Ci decreased simultaneously, suggesting that the decreased Pn is mainly caused by stomatal conductance at this time point. Subsequently, a modest increase of Gs and Gi might cause Pn to increase rapidly. After twelve hours of high temperature treatment, Pn, Gs and Gi significantly and simultaneously decreased, suggesting that stomatal conductance again limited Pn in extended heat treatment. Meanwhile, analysis of photosynthesis under heat treatment indicated that photosynthesis completely recovered even six hours treatment. By contrast, after twelve and twenty-four hours of heat treatment, photosynthesis recovered to only 68.8% and 45.2% of control group levels, respectively, implying transient or permanent inhibition. Photosynthesis in plants is composed of interconnected biological processes, including CO<sub>2</sub> transport and biochemical processes located in the chloroplast thylakoid membranes, stroma, mitochondria and the cytosol of the cell. These biophysical and biochemical processes, and environmental variables determine the net rate of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, as suggested by Sharkey et al., 2007, presentation of A-Cc curves and a florescence relaxation analysis should be added in future studies to examine how genetics and environment affect photosynthesis.</p><p>As a non-intrusive method, chlorophyll fluorescence analysis can detect the effects of environment stress in plants and give insights into the ability of a plant to tolerant environment stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Fo is the fluorescence level when all antenna pigment complexes associated with the photosystem are assumed to be open (dark adapted). An increase of Fo represents the extent to which chloroplasts are affected by an environmental stress. Fv/Fm reflects the photosynthetic capability of the entire PSII and the maximum quantum efficiency of open PSII centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A significant decrease of Fv/Fm suggested an increase in energy dissipation as heat and photoinhibition to the photosynthetic apparatus. <italic>q</italic>P indicated that a percentage of the PSII reaction centers was closed at any time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We found that Fo increased and Fv/Fm, F&#x02032;v/F&#x02032;m, <italic>q</italic>P and ETR significantly decreased along with continuous high temperature (42&#x000b0;C), suggesting that the photosystem could be inhibited after 12 h heat stress, together with the limitation of stomatal factors leading Pn, which did not return to normal levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of high temperature on activities of antioxidant enzymes</title><p>Temperature stress induced production of reactive oxygen species, which can damage plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. To protect the plants from oxidative stress and maintain normal cellular functions, plants have enzymatic scavengers including APX, CAT, POD, SOD, and Glutathione Reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. SOD, as a major scavenger of superoxide anion radicals, provides the first defense mechanism of the antioxidant system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], catalysing the dismutation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, CAT, POD and other antioxidant enzymes scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our results indicated that activities of a set of antioxidant enzymes were induced by high temperature stress at three and six hours, implying that the combined action of SOD, CAT, POD and APX converts the toxic O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to water and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), thereby protecting the cell from oxidative stress. At twelve and twenty-four hours, all of the activities of antioxidant enzymes were repressed, suggesting that the efficiency of scavenging O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might be decreased, thus damaging cellular membranes.</p><p>MDA concentrations indicate the extent of lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this study, the progressive high temperature stress resulted in MDA concentrations that sharply increased after twelve hours of heat stress, indicating that membrane damage had occurred. Also, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased significantly. Combined with activities of antioxidants enzymes suggesting that efficiency of scavenging O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreased along with decreases in activities of antioxidants enzymes, leading to damage in cellular membrane after twelve hours of heat treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Heat-responsive genes involved in photosynthesis</title><p>Efficient photosynthesis involves photosynthetic pigments and photosystems, the electron transport system, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathways, and glycollic metabolism. Damage to any of these components may reduce photosynthetic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been long believed that the major heat-sensitive component is the PSII center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Consistent with this conclusion, our results revealed that 20 differentially expressed genes were detected for PSII, with only four genes increased and 16 genes decreased. More genes were down-regulated than up-regulated, suggesting that PSII might be suffered more negative effects from heat stress than PSI.</p><p>The majority of photosynthetic energy is harnessed via linear electron flow involving light-stimulated electron transfer between two reaction centers, PSI and PSII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Interestingly, in the light reaction, all four genes (<italic>PETA</italic>, <italic>PETB</italic>, <italic>PETM</italic> and <italic>ATPA</italic>) for the redox chain were up-regulated at six hours, implying that electron transport might be induced by high temperature at this timepoint. Sharkey et al. (2005) reported that the cyclic transport of electrons can be induced by moderately high temperature (35&#x000b0;C - 45&#x000b0;C) and thylakoid membranes become leaky at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Tozzi et al. (2013) suggested that significant increases in the rate of cyclic electron transport at high temperatures may counteract thylakoid membrane leakiness and provide protection against irreversible damage. In contrary, Ferreira et al. (2006) indicated that photosynthetic linear electron flow was induced along with a decrease of PSII abundance and an increase of PSI in <italic>P. euphratica</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These suggest that electron transport (cyclic or linear) induced by heat stress in <italic>P. simonii</italic> needs further study.</p><p>In photosynthesis, <italic>PSBD</italic> encodes PSII D2, which produces non-radiative energy dissipation, a highly effective protective mechanism against photodamage. Sane et al. (2002) indicated that the accumulation of PSII D2 protein may promote resistance to high excitation pressure induced by exposure to either low temperature or high light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our data showed that <italic>PSBD</italic> was significantly up-regulated at six hours of heat treatment, suggesting that <italic>PSBD</italic> might be involved in protective mechanisms against photodamage at this time point. Cytochrome b6f mediates the transfer of electrons between the two photosynthetic reaction centers, while protons are transferred from the chloroplast stroma across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Electron transport via cytochrome b6f creates the proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP in chloroplasts, which is essential for repair of PSII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. <italic>PETA, PETB</italic>, and <italic>PETM</italic>, encoding cytochrome a, b and m(6) subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex respectively, were up-regulated significantly under heat stress compared with controls, suggesting that <italic>PETB</italic> in <italic>P. simonii</italic> may play an important role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and repair of PSII under heat stress. Meanwhile, <italic>ATPA</italic>, encoding the ATPase alpha subunit, which catalyzes the conversion of ADP to ATP using the proton motive force, was up-regulated 5.01-fold under heat stress. Gene expression results revealed that the combined action of these four genes promotes the synthesis of ATP under high temperature.</p><p>In the Calvin cycle, seven genes involved in carboxylation, reduction and regeneration were significantly repressed, suggesting that these processes were negatively regulated by heat stress (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It is fairly well known Rubisco activase enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate for fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis and its denaturing/disruption occurs at roughly 35 - 38&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It is suggesting that the represses of carboxylation processes is likely a cause for the Rubisco decline that causes photosynthesis to plummet at higher temperatures. As suggested by Sharkey and Zhang (2010), Rubisco deactivation may be a protective acclimation strategy for heat tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. By contrast, <italic>CPN60A</italic>, which is involved in carboxylation, was up-regulated under heat stress. CPN60 plays an important role in protecting plant photosynthesis against heat stress and also affects the recovery of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. <italic>CPN60A</italic> was significantly up-regulated under heat stress, indicating that the mechanisms for protection of photosynthesis were activated in <italic>P. simonii</italic> under heat stress.</p><p>As a key role in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, Rubisco is not completely capable of discriminating its substrate CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> during oxygenic photosynthesis. Thus, 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG) is produced by oxygenation of RuBP, a strong inhibitor of enzymes in photosynthetic carbon metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. 2-PG can be scavenged by photorespiration and converted to 3-phosphoglycerate, which can re-enter the Calvin cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The chloroplast enzyme PGLP1 catalyzes the first reaction of the photorespiratory C2 cycle that converts 2-phosphoglycolate to glycolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In our study, <italic>PGLP1</italic>, encoding 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase, was persistently up-regulated with heat stress suggesting that the inhibition of photosynthesis was released due to scavenging of 2-PG. This might lead to increases in glycolate concentrations, along with 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism. The photorespiratory enzyme GOX plays an important role in converting glycolate to glyoxylate and in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Three members of the <italic>GOX</italic> gene family were differentially expressed under heat stress. At six hours, all three <italic>GOX</italic> genes were down-regulated, suggesting that the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate was inhibited and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was not produced. After twelve hours of high temperature treatment, the abundance of <italic>PGLP1</italic> and <italic>GOX1-3</italic> transcripts were significantly and consistently increased, suggesting that regulation of these genes, combined with decreases in activities of antioxidant enzymes, might be the main reason for massive production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>After three hours of heat treatment and recovery at room temperature, the expression of all eight candidate genes recovered to control levels, suggesting that plant photosynthesis was not damaged by three hours of heat treatment. Among these genes, <italic>PETM</italic> and <italic>PETB</italic> gene expression were higher than controls after recovery from 6h heat treatment, implying that moderately high temperature might help ETR, consistent with Sharkey et al. (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. After recovery from twelve hours of heat treatment, expression of all ETR-related genes did not recover completely, suggesting that irreversible damage was caused by prolonged heat stress. Differently, expression of <italic>PGLP1</italic> and <italic>GOX1-3</italic> was higher than the control group under heat stress of more than six hours, implying that the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might be maintained for a long time. This is consistent with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> measurements after recovery from heat stress. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is often seen as part of the plant signaling cascade leading to protection from abiotic stresses; therefore <italic>PGLP1</italic> and <italic>GOX1-3</italic> expression might improve poplar stress adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Heat-responsive transcription factors</title><p>The DREB family is important in regulating plant responses to abiotic stress. DREBs belong to the AP2/ERF family of transcription factors (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki 1994), which confer stress tolerance in plants and are one of the largest and most diverse families of proteins involved in the regulation of plant responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are two classes of <italic>DREB</italic> genes, <italic>DREB1</italic> and <italic>DREB2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. <italic>DREB2</italic> genes were initially identified as drought and high-salinity response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], and were later shown to be induced in response to heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, in this study, only three <italic>DREB2</italic> genes were detected and found to be significantly up-regulated under heat stress, suggesting that, in contrast to <italic>DREB2</italic>, in poplar, <italic>DREB1</italic> might not respond to heat stress.</p><p>The result that DREBs distinguish cold and dehydration signal transduction pathways was consistent with previous studies. For example, Chen et al. (2010) identified heat shock transcription factor A3 (<italic>HsfA3</italic>) as a highly up-regulated heat-inducible gene in transgenic plants over-expressing <italic>DREB2C</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>HsfA3</italic> expression is directly regulated by <italic>DREB2s</italic> under heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] and <italic>DREB2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic plants have increased tolerance to heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. DREB2C interacts with ABF2, a bZIP protein regulating ABA-responsive gene expression, and its overexpression is affected ABA sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Hwang et al. (2012) found that <italic>DREB2C</italic> plays an important role in promoting oxidative stress tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, suggesting that DREB2Cs may function as multi stimuli-response factors that interact with genes and/or proteins during different stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. In our study, we found that <italic>HSFA3</italic> and <italic>DREB2C</italic> were significantly up-regulated under heat stress, providing indirect evidence for interaction of <italic>HSFA3</italic> and <italic>DREB2C.</italic></p><p>The <italic>STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC1</italic> (<italic>SNAC1</italic>) gene is predominantly induced by abiotic stress in guard cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Over-expression of <italic>SNAC1</italic> in plants did not produce a negative phenotype, unlike overexpression of <italic>CBF/DREB1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>SNAC1</italic> increased abiotic stress tolerance, reduced transpiration rate and increased ABA sensitivity. Our results indicated that <italic>NAC001</italic> was significantly up-regulated after six hours of heat stress with notably increased stomatal closure, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating stomatal dynamics in poplar under heat stress.</p><p><italic>MYB60</italic> and <italic>MYB61</italic> are directly involved in stomatal dynamics in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and play opposite roles in stomatal closure: <italic>MYB60</italic> promotes stomatal opening, and <italic>MYB 61</italic> promotes stomatal closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>].

Analysis of photosynthesis under heat treatment indicated that stomatal conductance is the main cause for the decrease in Gs and Ci at three hours, and continuing after twelve hours, of high temperature treatment. Over twelve hours high temperature treatment might cause permanent inhibition of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis showed that photosystems could be inhibited after twelve hours heat stress, together with the limitation of stomatal factors altering Pn, which did not completely return to normal levels. Combined photosynthetic physiology and gene expression analyses indicated that ETR, in the light reaction, was not significantly changed, but expression of four genes (<italic>PETA</italic>, <italic>PETB</italic>, <italic>PETM</italic> and <italic>ATPA</italic>) for the redox chain was up-regulated at six hours heat stress, implying that cyclic electron transport might be induced by high temperature at this time point.
