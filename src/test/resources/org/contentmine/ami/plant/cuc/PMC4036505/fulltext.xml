The approach integrated sequence analyses, transcript profiling, and development of a conifer-specific activation assay. Transcript accumulation profiles of 102 TFs and potential target genes were clustered to identify groups of coordinately expressed genes. Several different patterns of transcript accumulation were observed by profiling in nine different organs and tissues: 27 genes were preferential to secondary xylem both in stems and roots, and other genes were preferential to phelloderm and periderm or were more ubiquitous. A robust system has been established as a screening approach to define which TFs have the ability to regulate a given promoter <italic>in planta</italic>. <italic>Trans</italic>-activation or repression effects were observed in 30% of TF&#x02013;candidate gene promoter combinations. As a proof of concept, phylogenetic analysis and expression and <italic>trans</italic>-activation data were used to demonstrate that two spruce NAC-domain proteins most likely play key roles in secondary vascular growth as observed in other plant species. This study tested many TFs from diverse families in a conifer tree species, which broadens the knowledge of promoter&#x02013;TF interactions in wood development and enables comparisons of gene regulatory networks found in angiosperms and gymnosperms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Conifer</kwd><kwd>expression pattern</kwd><kwd><italic>Picea glauca</italic></kwd><kwd>secondary cell wall</kwd><kwd>somatic embryogenesis</kwd><kwd><italic>trans</italic>-activation assay</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>xylem.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants produce wood through a process of secondary xylem development and growth with four major steps: initial cell division, cell expansion, cell-wall thickening, and programmed cell death (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Plomion <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Characteristic structures are thus formed that impart strength to support the plant body and the ability to transport water and nutrients efficiently from the roots to other organs (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Miyashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Secondary vascular growth represents a key adaptation and a major carbon sink in woody perennial plants; however, it is also observed on a smaller scale and studied in herbaceous plants. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it has been shown that the events of underlying primary and secondary vascular development are under tight regulatory control and involve transcription factors (TFs) from the R2R3-MYB (MYB), basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix, KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX), homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip), and NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC)-domain families (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Demura and Fukuda, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Dixon, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Recent studies have begun to unravel a transcriptional network regulating xylem development and growth. For example, the NAC-domain proteins are plant-specific TFs with several members playing a central regulatory role in xylogenesis, fibre development, and wood formation (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010a</xref>). Several NAC-domain genes are preferentially expressed in the cambial zone or xylem cells such as vascular elements and in interfascicular fibres (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Demura and Fukuda, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Dixon, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, NAC-domain proteins (SND1, NSTs, and VNDs) orchestrate a transcriptional cascade involving MYB regulatory proteins, ultimately activating the transcription of enzymes involved in secondary cell wall (SCW) assembly. A similar cascade involving functional NAC-domain genes called WNDs (Wood-Associated NAC Domain TFs) and MYBs has been described in poplar and eucalyptus (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Zhong and Ye, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The vascular tissues of angiosperms and gymnosperms have a number of anatomical and biochemical features in common and also many distinctive properties (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Pallardy, 2008</xref>). These range from cell types and secondary cell macromolecules (both lignins and hemicelluloses) to intercellular connections and growth responses to stress (e.g. reaction wood). Conifers are a dominant group among the gymnosperms that may serve for comparative developmental studies in addition to being economically and ecologically important. Genomic initiatives in conifers have developed large gene sequence data sets, gene maps, and expression profiles (reviewed by <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Mackay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and more recently the complete genome sequences of two spruce species (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Birol <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Nystedt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and a pine (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.pinegenome.org/pinerefseq/">http://www.pinegenome.org/pinerefseq/</uri>). These information resources represent a foundation to accelerate the discovery of regulatory mechanisms of secondary growth and wood formation.</p><p content-type="indent">A class of transcriptional regulators that has been well studied in conifer vascular development are the R2R3-MYBs. The loblolly pine (<italic>Pinus taeda</italic> L.) genes <italic>PtMYB1</italic> and <italic>PtMYB4</italic> have been shown to be expressed in differentiating secondary xylem and to activate transcription through specific binding to AC motifs from promoters of most of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Patzlaff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003a</xref>,b). When overexpressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco, these MYBs induced ectopic lignification (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Patzlaff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Newman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Several other R2R3-MYB genes have been characterized in white spruce (<italic>Picea glauca</italic> (Moench) Voss), loblolly pine (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bedon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Bomal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and in maritime pine (<italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> Ait.; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Craven-Bartle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed conservation in gene family structure between conifers and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p content-type="indent">Research groups, including the current group, have overexpressed R2R3-MYBs and other TFs in transgenic conifer trees. Constitutive expression of <italic>PtMYB1</italic> or <italic>PtMYB8</italic> in spruce lines resulted in ectopic SCW deposition and increased lignin accumulation (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Bomal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Craven-Bartle <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> independently showed that a <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> homologue of MYB8 is a candidate regulator of phenylpropanoid metabolism and lignin synthesis genes.

This group has developed a rapid transient transformation system for conifers to circumvent the problems related to the selection of specific appropriate transgenic lines (mostly due to integration position effects) and nonspecific activation of genes or pathways through nontarget interactions. This article reports the development of a method for functional testing of TFs using a robust <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-based transformation protocol using embryonic spruce cells, which are easily cultured to facilitate the screening of a large number of genes directly in a conifer. This system enables the simultaneous introduction of TF-expression vectors and promoter&#x02013;reporter gene constructs into spruce and evaluation of resulting gene expression on a weekly basis. Over 600 functional assays were carried out with 59 full-length cDNAs encoding TFs cloned into plant expression vectors and putative promoter sequences for 12 candidate genes from <italic>Picea glauca</italic>. The portfolio of TFs and promoters was developed from the <italic>Picea glauca</italic> gene catalogue (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Rigault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The current work reports the identification of several TF&#x02013;promoter combinations showing <italic>trans</italic>-activation using this experimental system. Sequence analyses, expression clustering profiling and clustering, and <italic>trans</italic>-activation results were integrated to identify a putative spruce NAC TF proposed to control transcriptional activation for genes involved in SCW formation in <italic>Picea glauca</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material</title><p>For transcript profiling, 3-year-old white spruce seedlings obtained from open-pollinated seed lots were transferred to 2-l pots and grown in a greenhouse under natural photoperiod from mid-April to the end of June.

Duncan&#x02019;s multiple range test was used to determine preferential expression among the nine tissues. The analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment release 2.12.1. In addition, 15 genes were tested for consistency between day 1 and day 2. Strong and statistically significant Pearson&#x02019;s coefficients (mean 0.86) were obtained between days for the 13 genes that varied between tissues, and no interactions were observed between day and tissue effects, even though the day effect was significant for some genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru116/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>).

Hierarchical clustering of genes and tissues was used to represent tissue-preferential transcript accumulation. The self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) was used to cluster genes and define expression profiles according to the following parameters: maximum cell diversity 0.01, Euclidean distance, and a maximum of 12 cycles.

For each of the TF&#x02013;promoter combinations, the observed reporter gene expression was rated based on the number of filters showing increased GUS blue staining. <italic>Trans</italic>-activations were rated as positive when visually at least three of the four filters showed clearly increased expression of GUS by histological staining (relative to the control), or likely positive when only two filters showed clearly increased GUS expression. In the absence of increased GUS expression on any of the four filters, or when only one filter was positive, the test was evaluated as showing no <italic>trans</italic>-activation.

Although it cannot reveal morphological phenotypes such as cell-wall composition or vascular tissue architecture, it represents a rapid approach to obtaining indications of TF&#x02013;promoter interactions. To date, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco protoplast transfections have been extensively used as transient expression systems. Nevertheless, protoplast transfection systems have been developed for emerging model systems such as <italic>Physcomitrella patents</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Th&#x000e9;venin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) that are fast, versatile, and robust allowing elucidation of specific TF roles in signalling activities and cellular processes. The current work aimed to develop a homologous transient transformation method in spruce for qualitative testing of promoter&#x02013;TF <italic>trans</italic>-activations on a large scale. To achieve this goal, first a resource for testing potential interactions of TFs with several different promoters in conifers was developed by assembling a portfolio of spruce promoters and a large collection of the complete coding sequences of members of several families of spruce TFs. This method took advantage of the relative uniformity of the cells within embryogenic cell cultures and their compatibility with genetic transformation by <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>. The <italic>trans</italic>-activation system developed here offers a distinct advantage to functional testing using a heterologous species (such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) in that key cofactors required for TF function are more likely to be present in a homologous species. This, however, does not rule out the possibility that key factors unique to a specific tissue type such as developing secondary xylem may not be present in somatic embryonal cells. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that a homologous system would better reflect reality compared to the use of a yeast one-hybrid assay for instance.</p><p content-type="indent">This approach revealed positive interactions of promoters resulting from TF <italic>trans</italic>-activation. Most of the promoters that were tested did not show background expression that could result from endogenous expression of TFs. Some TF families have been shown to form complexes with other proteins in order to activate properly their target genes. This was found to be particularly important in the regulation of specific genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway where a number of MYB TFs were shown to form ternary complexes with basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix and WDR type proteins (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hichri <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). It is possible that the lack of promoter&#x02013;TF <italic>trans</italic>-activation is due to the absence of required cofactors. However, the method described here could easily accommodate for the introduction of a third gene construct encoding a specific cofactor, in addition to the TF-coding region and the promoter&#x02013;reporter constructs. Also, any artificial <italic>trans</italic>-activation system is prone to false positives and this includes the one described here; the level of transcript accumulation of the tested TF is likely to be higher in the transiently transformed cells since strong promoters are commonly used. Also, this work cannot exclude the possibility that indirect or nonspecific promoter induction could result from high accumulation of the TF in the cell. However, this study group is quite confident about the robustness of this method as the data obtained confirms existing knowledge in the literature. As far as is known, the scope of the study greatly extends the number of TFs and promoter interactions that have been studied in any vascular plant species outside of flowering plants.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Conifer class-IIB NAC-domain proteins display general features similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, NAC-domain proteins (SND1, NSTs, and VNDs) orchestrate a transcriptional cascade that involves R2R3-MYBs and regulates vascular differentiation and SCW formation. Functional orthologues of members of this network described have been identified in poplar and eucalyptus (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Zhong and Ye, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010a</xref>). For example, poplar and eucalyptus NAC-domain proteins similar to AtNSTs/AtVNDs have been characterized through their expression patterns and restoration of WT phenotype in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants. Moreover, WNDs and MYB proteins in poplar and eucalyptus were shown to be directly involved in the transcriptional cascade described in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, suggesting a relative conservation of a core regulatory network related to SCW biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Zhong and Ye, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). It was suggested that a similar cascade may also regulate SCW formation in conifers (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Bomal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), but until the current report, functional evidence had only been obtained for MYBs (MYB1 and MYB8 from pine and spruce).</p><p content-type="indent">This report shows that <italic>PgNAC-4</italic> and <italic>PgNAC-7</italic> are the only two NAC-domain genes that clustered within the IIB subfamily. As such, they represent candidate NAC genes that could participate in a cascade regulating vascular development analogous to that described in angiosperm plants and trees. The data show that the PgNAC-7 amino acid sequence uniquely clusters with AtVND 4/5/6 and with poplar orthologues PtrVDN 3(A,B) and 4(A,B) and is distinct from other VNDs from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and poplar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Its expression is strongly preferential to secondary tissue in both stems and roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and its transient expression activates the expression from promoters of MYBs (<italic>MYB1</italic> and <italic>MYB8</italic>) that have been linked to SCW formation, as well as downstream proteins and enzymes involved in cell-wall assembly (PgCAD, Pg4CL, PgTUA-1, PgXTH8-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In contrast, PgNAC-4 specifically clustered with the SMB/BRN subclass genes AtSMB, AtBRN1, and AtBRN2 involved in cell-type specification and SCW modification during root cap maturation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). <italic>PgNAC-4</italic> transcripts were found in all of the <italic>Picea glauca</italic> tissues tested but were clearly preferential (8&#x02013;10-fold difference) to root tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In the <italic>trans</italic>-activation assays, PgNAC-4 gave positive interactions with promoters from genes related to SCW formation (<italic>PgCAD</italic>, <italic>Pg4CL</italic>, <italic>PgDHS2</italic>) as did PgNAC-7.
