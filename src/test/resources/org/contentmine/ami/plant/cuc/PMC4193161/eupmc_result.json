    "BACKGROUND: Independent transcriptome profile analyses of miRNAs or mRNAs under conditions of cadmium (Cd) stress have been widely reported in plants. However, a combined analysis of sRNA sequencing expression data with miRNA target expression data to infer the relative activities of miRNAs that regulate gene expression changes resulting from Cd stress has not been reported in rice. To elucidate the roles played by miRNAs in the regulation of changes in gene expression in response to Cd stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we simultaneously characterized changes in the miRNA and mRNA profiles following treatment with Cd. RESULTS: A total of 163 miRNAs and 2,574 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed under Cd stress, and the changes in the gene expression profile in the shoot were distinct from those in the root. At the miRNA level, 141 known miRNAs belonging to 48 families, and 39 known miRNAs in 23 families were identified to be differentially expressed in the root and shoot, respectively. In addition, we identified eight new miRNA candidates from the root and five from the shoot that were differentially expressed in response to Cd treatment. For the mRNAs, we identified 1,044 genes in the root and 448 genes in the shoot that were up-regulated, while 572 and 645 genes were down-regulated in the root and shoot, respectively. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that genes encoding secondary, metabolite synthases, signaling molecules, and ABC transporters were significantly enriched in the root, while only ribosomal protein and carotenoid biosynthesis genes were significantly enriched in the shoot. Then 10 known miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs and six new candidate ones, that showed the opposite expression patterns, were identified by aligning our two datasets against online databases and by using the UEA sRNA toolkit respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use high throughput DNA sequencing to simultaneously detect changes in miRNA and mRNA expression patterns in the root and shoot in response to Cd treatment. These integrated high-throughput expression data provide a valuable resource to examine global genome expression changes in response to Cd treatment and how these are regulated by miRNAs."
