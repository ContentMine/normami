In the current study, 124 NAC members were identified in <italic>Zea mays</italic> and were phylogenetically clustered into 13 distinct subfamilies. The whole genome duplication (WGD), especially an additional WGD event, may lead to expanding ZmNAC members. Different subfamily has different expansion rate, and NAC subfamily preference was found during the expansion in maize. Moreover, the duplication events might occur after the divergence of the lineages of <italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>S. italica</italic>, and segmental duplication seemed to be the dominant pattern for the gene duplication in maize. Furthermore, the expansion of ZmNAC members may be also related to gain and loss of introns. Besides, the restriction of functional divergence was discovered after most of the gene duplication events. These results could provide novel insights into molecular evolution and expansion analysis of NAC family in maize, and advance the NAC researches in other plants, especially polyploid plants.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Ministry of Agriculture (2009ZX08009-061B) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31171616).

<xref rid="pone.0111837-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

The NAC domain (nearly 160 amino acid residues) can be further divided into five subdomains labeled from A to E and it is involved in DNA binding <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ernst1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, while the TAR region usually is related to the regulation diversity and it may determine some specific functions <xref rid="pone.0111837-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Moreover, previous lines of evidence have already demonstrated that NAC family may be an excellent candidate to regulate the plant development and growth, without the exception for maize. ZmNAC41 and ZmNAC100 were reported to be related to the maize defense network <xref rid="pone.0111837-Voitsik1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and ZmSNAC1 can enhance tolerance to dehydration in transgenic Arabidopsis <xref rid="pone.0111837-Lu2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

However, the related researches about the NAC family are limited in maize. Besides, duplication event has been extensively existed in many plants, but the related reports, especially in a specific family, are lacked in maize. Thus, a systematic molecular evolution and expansion analysis of the ZmNAC members is urgently required to comprehensively understand the genetics, evolution, basic function and expansion history of the NAC family in maize. In the present study, we identified NAC family in maize; and we conducted a relatively detailed research about the phylogenetics, genomic-dynamic, chromosomal localization, expansion history and expression analysis to evaluate molecular evolution and expansion history of ZmNAC family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and structural analysis of the ZmNAC proteins</title><p>All NAC proteins of Arabidopsis were collected from TAIR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp">http://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp</ext-link>).

According to the number of exons/introns, the ZmNAC family could be divided into five types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s008">Table S3</xref>). The first type contained 67 ZmNACs and had three exons. The second type had no intron as 6 ZmNAC belonged to this type. 19 genes formed the third type with only one intron. The fourth type had 24 genes which contained three, four or five introns. The fifth type mainly covered genes with the most exons (the number is 7, 8, 9 or 14). The largest number of the exons was found in ZmNAC39 with 14 exons. The first type of gene structure included most of ZmNAC subfamily, while the ANAC063 subfamily covered the second type.

The first (140 bp&#x02013;230 bp) and second exon (230 bp&#x02013;340 bp) showed the relatively conserved exon length. However, the divergent length and number mainly existed after the second exon, especially for ONAC003, TIP, ANAC011 and NAC2 subfamily. Besides, the gain and loss of introns resulted in the different gene structures. Some SENU5, NAC1 and OsNAC7 members lost an intron in the second and third exon, while the similar loss in the first and second exon mainly existed in the ATAF, TIP and NAC2 subfamily. Moreover, the ONAC022 and NAM subfamily contained the above-mentioned two intron loss. In addition, the intron gain usually existed in the third exon, especially for the ONAC003, TIP, ANAC011 and NAC2 subfamily. In contrast, the NAP subfamily did not undergo any changes in the gene structure, and still had three exons. Furthermore, there were not any introns in the ANAC063 members. Meanwhile, the first and second intron phase is 1 and 0 in most ZmNAC subfamilies.

The ONAC022, OsNAC7, ONAC003 and NAM subfamily had the most members, while other subfamilies contained relatively few ZmNACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The similar distribution of NAC family also can be found in banana <xref rid="pone.0111837-Shan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, chinese cabbage <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> and so on. Then the protein structure, orthologous group, gene structure and conserved motifs confirmed the similar classification of NAC family in maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s007">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s008">Table S3</xref>). In addition, NAC family plays significant roles in plant-specific processes <xref rid="pone.0111837-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Puranik2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The microarray chips were used to investigate ZmNAC&#x02019;s functions in the developmental stages and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, only 29 ZmNACs have their corresponding probes in the Genevestigator database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s012">Table S7</xref>). These arrays from ESTs, not whole genome coverage, maybe partially lead to the relatively low coverage of ZmNAC members. Similar phenomenon also existed in the soybean <xref rid="pone.0111837-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Furthermore, combing with the EST frequency, NAC2 subfamily was discovered to express highly in the root, which indicated that NAC2 subfamily in maize may be related to root development. But two NAC2 members (ZmNAC65 and ZmNAC100) showed high expression level in the leaf and stem by qRT-PCR analysis. The different result maybe partially due to the extensively expression of NAC2 subfamily in almost of all the tissues and all the developmental stages. Meanwhile, the NAM subfamily in maize may be involved in the flower development, which has been confirmed in the NAM subfamily of Arabidopsis and petunia <xref rid="pone.0111837-Souer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Aida1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Moreover, ZmNAC102, one of ATAF members, has been previously found to control the lateral root development through miRNA164-directed cleavage <xref rid="pone.0111837-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, and due to relatively high expression in root, other ATAF members might have similar function in maize like ZmNAC102. Thus, the functions within the NAC subfamily were relatively conserved throughout maize and plant kingdom; and different subfamilies might have different biological functions, mainly because of distinct structure, especially in the TAR region. Additionally, it is suggested that the NAC family is a perfect candidate to regulate the plant growth and development.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Expansion of the NAC family in <italic>Z. mays</italic></title><p><italic>Z. mays</italic> is an important model plant for fundamental research on evolutionary history. In the current research, we isolated 124 NAC transcription factors in maize (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s006">Table S1</xref>). Then the NAC members were also identified in <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and <italic>S. italica</italic> through the same method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The number of NAC members revealed that the NAC family was a little larger in maize than in other three monocots, and it may be due to the larger genome. Meanwhile, the expansion of NAC members in maize confirmed some previous observations which the same subfamily from different plants shared the similar functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g006">Figure 6</xref>, Figure7). Through sequence and OG analysis, the duplicated genes of NAC family were discovered in maize (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111837-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s007">Table S2</xref>). According to the chromosomal distributions, most of the duplicated genes located in different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s009">Table S4</xref>). Meanwhile, the duplication events mainly concentrated on some specific subfamilies including the ONAC022, NAC2, ATAF, NAM, ONAC003, OsNAC8 and OsNAC7 subfamily, whereas no duplicated ones were detected in other subfamilies. Thus, it revealed the strong expansion preference for some NAC subfamilies. As an important paleopolyploid plant, maize has experienced a meaningful process from an ancient allotetraploid to a genetically diploid state <xref rid="pone.0111837-Schnable1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. During this process, numerous chromosomal breakages and fusions resulted in gene losses and gene retentions as duplicate orthologs. Based on the analysis of NAC family in maize, retention of ZmNAC members as duplicates is not random, e.g. the expansion preference of some ZmNAC subfamilies. Thus, it is indicated that the ZmNAC subfamily might have various retention rate during the plant evolution and the ZmNAC reference contributes to basic researches about plant evolution, especially polyploid plants e.g. <italic>Gossypium hissutum</italic>, <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> and <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>. In addition, the gene losses and retentions might be also associated to the related functions during the plant evolution. In addition, NAC family can control a variety of plant growth and development processes <xref rid="pone.0111837-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, according to the various retention rate of the ZmNAC subfamily, some putative key NAC members can be selected to regulate some phenotypes in the polyploid plants.</p><fig id="pone-0111837-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111837.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Heat map representation and hierarchical clustering of ZmNAC genes in <italic>Zea mays</italic> across different tissues.</title><p>The color bar represents the relative signal intensity value.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0111837.g007"/></fig><p>Previous studies revealed that the maize genome has undergone several rounds of genome duplication, including a paleopolyploid duplication event (about 70 Mya) <xref rid="pone.0111837-Paterson1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and an additional whole-genome duplication (WGD) event (about 12 Mya) <xref rid="pone.0111837-Blanc1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. In the ZmNAC family, most of duplication events (53%) might occur about less than 30 Mya, while 27% duplicated ones between 70 Mya and 87 Mya.

Only one pair of duplicated genes (ZmNAC 49/111) showed the different topology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s004">Figure S4O</xref>). The divergence may be attributed to the extensive rate variation among species <xref rid="pone.0111837-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Thus, it was concluded that the ZmNAC duplication events might mainly occur after the divergence of the lineages of <italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>S. italica</italic>. Above all, the expansion of NAC family in <italic>Z. mays</italic> arose from the whole genome duplication events, might mainly occur after the divergence of the lineages of <italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>S. italica</italic>, and the additional WGD event might have more influence on the expansion of ZmNAC members. The expansion of NAC family in other plants (e.g. <italic>G. raimondii</italic> and <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>) has been similarly related to the whole genome duplication events <xref rid="pone.0111837-Shang1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p><p>Compared with other monocots, maize has undergone relatively more chromosomal breakages and fusions <xref rid="pone.0111837-Schnable1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Meanwhile, the tandem duplication events in ZmNAC family might occur in less than 0.5 Mya (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111837-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, after an additional WGD event, interchromosomal rearrangements also have a certain effect on the expansion of ZmNAC members during the return to a genetically diploid state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Coincidently, this finding is consistent with the expansion of other gene families including ERF family and F-box family <xref rid="pone.0111837-Nakano1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Gagne1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>The conserved motifs&#x02019; role during ZmNAC expansion</title><p>The NAC family has a conserved structure including a highly conserved NAC domain in the N-terminal domain and a relatively divergent C-terminal domain <xref rid="pone.0111837-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Without exception, the ZmNAC family also contained the NAC domain and TAR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Then through sequence alignment, we found, subdomain A, C and D were tightly conserved, while subdomain B and E were relatively divergent. The similar phenomena also exist in NAC family of other plants <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ooka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, subdomain C was found to have a DNA binding domain (DBD), which indicated that subdomain C may be involved in the DNA binding <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ernst1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Moreover, the DBD sequence (WKATGXD[K/R]) resembled the DBD sequence (WRKYGQK) in the WRKY family <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ditte1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. This sequence similarity revealed that the NAC family and WRKY family might share the similar evolutionary history in maize, and the ZmNAC family may originate from the protist WRKY family in WRKY-GCM1 superfamily <xref rid="pone.0111837-Ditte1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Furthermore, the putative nuclear location signal (NLS) was found in the subdomain D, which indicated their nuclear localization. The transient expression of some NAC members from other plants also suggested that most of the NACs are a nuclear protein <xref rid="pone.0111837-Guo2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Pinheiro1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus, the NAC domain played an important role in some conserved functions such as stress responses.</p><p>Although the TAR region was divergent in the ZmNAC family, the TAR region within the same subfamily was relatively conserved, especially for the ATAF, NAC2, NAM, ONAC003, ONAC022 and OsNAC7 subfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This also may be the reason why the same NAC subfamily might regulate similar processes in different plants. Other plant-specific transcription factors have similar conditions, such as WRKY and MADS family <xref rid="pone.0111837-Zahn1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111837-Eulgem1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Gene structure dynamic during ZmNAC expansion</title><p>Intron is a characteristic feature of the eukaryotic genes, and the relatively little selective pressure acts on intron <xref rid="pone.0111837-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Most of ZmNAC had three exons and two introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111837.s008">Table S3</xref>). The first and second exon was relatively conserved in length, partially due to encoding the conserved NAC domain. However, there were different length and intron insertions in the third exon, especially for ONAC003, TIP, ANAC011 and NAC2 subfamily. The divergence of gene structure might mainly come from the exonization of intronic sequences or pseudoexonization of exonic sequences. Furthermore, compared with NAC family in other plants, the ZmNAC genes contained more large introns, partially because of insertion of repetitive elements <xref rid="pone.0111837-Schnable1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Meanwhile, gene structure also confirmed the previous classification of ZmNAC subfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Besides, the first and second intron phase were similar in ZmNAC subfamilies except the ONAC003 and ANAC063 subfamily. The ANAC063 subfamily did not have any intron phases, while first and second intron phase in the ONAC003 subfamily was entirely different from other subfamilies. This indicated that the expansion of ANAC063 and ONAC003 subfamily might be relatively independent from other subfamilies in maize. Above all, gain and loss of introns might take important parts in the expansion of ZmNAC members, and ANAC063 and ONAC003 subfamily perhaps have experienced the different evolutionary history from other ZmNAC subfamilies.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Functionalization of the ZmNAC duplicated genes during the maize evolution</title><p>During the evolutionary process, duplication genes might have experienced functionalization at the level of gene expression to retain in the genome <xref rid="pone.0111837-Duarte1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. In this study, 15 pairs of duplicated genes were identified in the ZmNAC family (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111837-t001">Table 1</xref>). Most of Ka/Ks ratio was less than 1 in these duplicated gene pairs, indicating that the ZmNAC genes have mainly undergone purifying selection pressure with limited functional divergence after the duplications. Then, the expression patterns of six pairs of duplicated genes (Ka/Ks &#x0003c;1) were very similar in the different tissues through qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111837-g005">Figure 5G&#x02013;K</xref>). These results indicated that most of the duplicated genes of ZmNAC family might retain some essential functions during sequent evolution. The retaining similar expression profiles may be related to highly similar amino acid sequence of these duplicated genes.

However, this reported paralogs was not regarded as duplicated genes in our study, mainly because of the relatively low sequence similarity.

This result indicated that this pair of duplicated genes might have undergone significant diversification after duplication. Above all, functional divergence was limited in ZmNAC family after most of the gene duplication events.</p><p>In summary, 124 NAC transcription factors were identified in <italic>Z. mays</italic> in this study.

Meanwhile, the whole genome duplication, especially an additional WGD event, might take important roles during the ZmNAC expansion and this expansion has a certain NAC subfamily preference in maize. Furthermore, the expansion of ZmNAC members may be related to gain and loss of introns. Moreover, the restriction of functional divergence was concluded after most of the gene duplication events.
