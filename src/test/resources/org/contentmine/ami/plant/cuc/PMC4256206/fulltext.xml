Here we show that PRL1 is required for the accumulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). PRL1 positively influences the processing of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Furthermore, PRL1 interacts with the pri-miRNA processor, DCL1, and the dsRNA processors (DCL3 and DCL4). These results suggest that PRL1 may function as a general factor to promote the production of miRNAs and siRNAs. We also show that PRL1 is an RNA-binding protein and associates with pri-miRNAs in vivo. In addition, <italic>prl1</italic> reduces pri-miRNA levels without affecting pri-miRNA transcription. These results suggest that PRL1 may stabilize pri-miRNAs and function as a co-factor to enhance DCL1 activity. We further reveal the genetic interaction of PRL1 with CDC5, which interacts with PRL1 and regulates transcription and processing of pri-miRNAs. Both miRNA and pri-miRNA levels are lower in <italic>cdc5 prl1</italic> than those in either <italic>cdc5</italic> or <italic>prl1</italic>. However, the processing efficiency of pri-miRNAs in <italic>cdc5 prl1</italic> is similar to that in <italic>cdc5</italic> and slightly lower than that in <italic>prl1</italic>. Based on these results, we propose that CDC5 and PRL1 cooperatively regulate pri-miRNA levels, which results in their synergistic effects on miRNA accumulation, while they function together as a complex to enhance DCL1 activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>PRL1, a conserved WD-40 protein, is required for plant development and immune responses. However, its functional mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show the positive impact of PRL1 on the accumulation of miRNAs and siRNAs, which are key regulators of plant growth and immunity. PRL1 interacts with multiple DCLs (the processors of miRNAs and siRNAs) and is required for their optimal activities, suggesting that PRL1 acts as a general factor to facilitate the production of miRNAs and siRNAs.

However, CDC5 and PRL1 do not show additive effects on the processing of pri-miRNAs. These results suggest that CDC5 and PRL1 may synergistically influence pri-miRNAs levels and act together as a complex to promote miRNA maturation. PRL1 also interacts with DCL3 and DCL4, which produces siRNAs, and is required for their optimal activities, suggesting that PRL1 may be a general accessory factor for the production of small RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The accumulation of miRNAs and siRNAs is reduced in <italic>prl1-2</italic>

These mutants are likely null since the transcripts of corresponding genes could not be detected by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004841.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

Several evidences including reduced accumulation of pri-miRNAs and miRNAs in <italic>prl1</italic>, PRL1-DCL1 interaction and PRL1-pri-miRNA association demonstrate that PRL1 positively impacts miRNA biogenesis. It has been suggested that PRL1 influences plant immunity and development through its impacts on RNA processing <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Given the essential roles of miRNAs in plant immunity and development, it is possible that reduced miRNA levels in <italic>prl1</italic> may partially contribute to the observed phenotypes.</p><p>PRL1 likely has a role in promoting miRNA maturation, as lack of PRL1 reduces processing of <italic>MIR162b</italic> and <italic>pre-miR162b</italic>. PRL1 interacts with the DCL1 complex and does not positively regulate the transcription of genes involved in miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004841.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that PRL1 may act as a co-factor to regulate DCL1 activity. CDC5, a direct interactor of PRL1 also regulates the DCL1 activity through its interaction with the helicase and dsRNA binding domains of DCL1. The effect of PRL1 on pri-miRNA processing appears to be weaker than that of CDC5. The processing efficiency of <italic>MIR162b</italic> and <italic>pre-miR162b</italic> in <italic>cdc5-1 prl1</italic>-<italic>2</italic> is similar to that in <italic>cdc5-1</italic> and slightly lower than that in <italic>prl1-2</italic>. This result suggests that PRL1 and CDC5 may act together as a complex to regulate DCL1 activity. Furthermore, gel filtration analysis suggests that PRL1 may not affect DCL1-CDC5 association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004841.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, it is possible that PRL1 may act as accessory factor to facilitate CDC5 function.</p><p>PRL1 also positively regulates the pri-miRNA levels since <italic>prl1</italic> reduces the accumulation of pri-miRNAs. We previously showed that CDC5 interacts with Pol II and positively regulate <italic>MIR</italic> transcription <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Since PRL1 associates with Pol II as well, it is possible that PRL1 acts as a component of the CDC5 complex to regulate <italic>MIR</italic> promoter activity. However this seems not to be the case, as loss-of-function of PRL1 does not affect the <italic>GUS</italic> levels driven by the <italic>MIR167a</italic> promoter. Consistent with this notion, the levels of pri-miRNAs are further reduced in <italic>cdc5-1 prl1-2</italic> compared with <italic>cdc5-1</italic> or <italic>prl1-2</italic>. Given the fact that PRL1 binds pri-miRNAs in <italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>vivo</italic>, we propose that PRL1 may stabilize pri-miRNAs. Indeed, the fact that the half-life of pri-miR164a and pri-miR167a in <italic>prl1</italic> is similar to that in Col suggests that the degradation of pri-miRNAs may be increased in <italic>prl1</italic>, because less efficient processing may lead to increased abundance of pri-miRNAs in <italic>prl1</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that PRL1 acts in <italic>MIR</italic> transcription after initiation, as it associates with Pol II.</p><p>In summary, we reveal that PRL1 positively regulates miRNA levels through its impacts on pri-miRNA levels and processing. PRL1 functions additively with its interactor CDC5 as miRNA abundance is lower in <italic>cdc5-1 prl1-2</italic> than in <italic>cdc5-1</italic> or <italic>prl1-2</italic>. The synergistic effect of CDC5 and PRL1 on miRNA levels can be explained by their different roles in controlling pri-miRNA levels rather than their function in promoting miRNA maturation. Besides CDC5 and PRL1, the core components MAC complex includes MOS4, MAC3A and MAC3B <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We show that MOS4 and MAC3b have no impact on miRNA levels. However, whether MAC3B has a role in miRNA accumulation needs to be further explored since it acts redundantly with MAC3A <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The MAC complex appears to have a role in siRNA biogenesis. Both CDC5 and PRL1 promote the accumulation of siRNA <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> while MOS4 is required for the accumulation of ra-siRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. How does MAC participate in siRNA biogenesis? We have showed both PRL1 and CDC5 interact with the DCL1 complex and regulate its activity. By analogy, it is possible that the MAC complex associates with the DCL3 complex to regulate its activity. In fact, DCL3 interacts with PRL1. <italic>prl1</italic> also reduces the abundance of ta-siRNAs, whose production requires DCL4 and DCL1-dependent miRNAs. Since PRL1 interacts with DCL4 and is required for the accumulation of DCL1-dependent miRNAs, it may promote ta-siRNA production through facilitating DCL4 function and miRNA production. The MAC complex is an evolutionarily conserved complex <xref rid="pgen.1004841-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. As many aspects of small RNA pathway are conserved, it is tempting to propose that the counterparts of MAC play some roles in small RNA pathways in other organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials</title><p>The <italic>mac3b</italic> (SALK_050811), <italic>mos4</italic> (SALK_0090851C), <italic>prl1-2</italic> (Salk_008466), <italic>snc1</italic> (SALK_047058C) and <italic>cdc5-1</italic> (SAIL_207_F03) mutants were ordered from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resources Center (ABRC).
