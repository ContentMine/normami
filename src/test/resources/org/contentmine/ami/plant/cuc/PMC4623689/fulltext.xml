Several NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) proteins have been documented as important regulators in stress responses, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, a stress-responsive NAC gene, <italic>SNAC3</italic> (ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), conferring drought and heat tolerance in rice is reported. <italic>SNAC3</italic> was ubiquitously expressed and its transcript level was induced by drought, high temperature, salinity stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Overexpression (OE) of <italic>SNAC3</italic> in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of <italic>SNAC3</italic> by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses. The <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, malondiadehyde (MDA), and relative electrolyte leakage than the wild-type control under heat stress conditions, implying that <italic>SNAC3</italic> may confer stress tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the expression of a large number of ROS-scavenging genes was dramatically increased in the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE plants, but significantly decreased in the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-RNAi transgenic plants. Five ROS-associated genes which were up-regulated in <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE plants showed co-expression patterns with <italic>SNAC3</italic>, and three of the co-expressed ROS-associated enzyme genes were verified to be direct target genes of SNAC3. These results suggest that SNAC3 plays important roles in stress responses, and it is likely to be useful for engineering crops with improved tolerance to heat and drought stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>NAC</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza sativa</italic></kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>transcription factors.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants frequently encounter diverse environmental cues which restrict their growth and development. Among the adverse external stimuli, extreme temperature and water deficit are two major factors that plants frequently confront. To compensate for their sessile lifestyle, plants have evolved a series of sophisticated but efficient strategies to cope with stress conditions. Among these strategies, plants respond to the stresses through stress-specific signalling pathways, which ultimately lead to morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes to adapt to unfavourable environmental conditions. Plants perceive the external signals through sensors, and trigger changes in expression of numerous stress-responsive genes and the synthesis of diverse functional proteins to enable them to survive. Based on the biological functions, genes responsive to the stresses mainly include the functional genes, which encode functional proteins or other products to protect plant cells directly from damage, and the regulatory genes whose products can regulate signal perception and transduction, and the expression of downstream genes under stress conditions (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010</xref>). Various transcription factors function as central regulators and molecular switches for gene expression control in the stress signalling and adaptation networks (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Increasing evidence supporting the role of NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors as key regulators in response to abiotic stresses has been reported in recent years (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Puranik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). NAC transcription factors comprise one of the largest gene families, which to date are only found in plants. NAC proteins are identified by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which is termed the NAC domain, in the N-terminal region, whereas the transcription regulatory region in the C-terminal of NAC proteins is usually diversified in both amino acid composition and length. NAC genes have been reported to be implicated in organ development and boundary maintenance, cell division, secondary wall synthesis, senescence, iron homeostasis, and defence agianst pathogens, and they also act as master regulators in abiotic stress responses (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Takada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Guo and Gan, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Uauy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Puranik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The <italic>RD26</italic> (<italic>RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 26</italic>) gene was the first NAC gene identified as a regulator in mediating cross-talk between abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonate (JA) signalling during stress responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007</xref>). Overexpressing ANAC019, ANAC055, or ANAC072, which were induced by drought, salt, and ABA, conferred drought tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Tran <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> identified the consensus NACRS [NAC recognition site, CGT(G/A)] and CDBS (core DNA-binding sequence, CACG) in the promoter region of the <italic>Arabidopsis ERD1</italic> (<italic>EARLY RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 1</italic>) gene. The recognition sequence for NAC factors might be conserved in plants, since quite a few NAC factors can bind to this NACRS (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts mainly from aerobic respiration, and were initially considered as toxic molecules which caused oxidative damage to DNA, protein, and membrane lipids in plant cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that ROS also act as important signalling molecules in the complex networks of stress responses (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Bechtold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Baxter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Plants have developed complicated scavenging and regulation pathways to monitor tightly the ROS redox homeostasis in order to avoid the excessive accumulation of ROS in cells. Emerging evidence supports that NAC transcription factors also participate in the regulation of ROS metabolism. An <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC transcription factor, NTL4, which was induced by drought and heat, triggered ROS production by directly binding to <italic>Atrboh</italic> gene promoters, resulting in leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Another NAC factor, JUB1, was described as a major longevity regulator in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>JUB1</italic> was H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive and could bind to the <italic>DREB2A</italic> promoter.

A membrane-associated NAC protein, ANAC013, was shown to bind and transactivate the mitochondrial dysfunction motif (MDM) to mediate mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR)-induced gene expression, and conferred increased tolerance to methyl viologen (MV) and rotenone-induced oxidative stress in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">De Clerq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">As one of the most important crops worldwide, rice provides staple food for more than half of the world&#x02019;s population. In facing climate changes and increasing global population, it is an urgent task to exploit stress resistance and yield stability of rice under adverse environmental conditions. In the past few decades, various stress-responsive transcription factors including NACs have been explored for engineering rice for improved stress tolerance through transgenic approaches (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sacar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). <italic>SNAC1</italic> overexpressors exhibited better performance under drought and salt stress conditions at the vegetative stage, and the transgenic plants also exhibited higher seed production under drought conditions at the reproductive stage (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>SNAC1</italic>, <italic>OsNAC10</italic>, and <italic>OsNAC5</italic> driven by a root-specific promoter <italic>RCc3</italic> enlarged the root diameter in rice, and therefore conferred increased drought resistance and grain yield under field drought conditions (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ishizaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; D.H. <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; J.S. <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In this study, another NAC transcription factor gene, <italic>SNAC3</italic>, which was responsive to various abiotic stresses, was characterized.

The data indicated that <italic>SNAC3</italic> regulates the heat stress response by adjusting the redox homeostasis state through controlling the expression of ROS-associated enzyme genes. It was also found that the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-mediated stress responses may be ABA-independent, which is different from many previous reports of stress-responsive NAC genes in rice. The findings indicate that SNAC3 is a crucial regulator in heat and drought stress responses, and has great potential in engineering crops with enhanced heat and drought tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and stress treatments</title><p>The <italic>japonica</italic> rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) cultivar (Zhonghua 11, ZH11) was used as a transformation recipient in this study.

For heat stress treatment at the seedling stage, transgenic plants and WT plants were grown in the same barrel in a split (half-and-half) manner under normal growth conditions. Seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were subjected to heat stress treatment by transferring the plants to a 42 &#x000b0;C growth chamber. After heat stress treatment for 1&#x02013;2 d, the seedlings were allowed to recover in normal growth conditions for 1 week. For drought stress treatment at the vegetative stage, transgenic plants and WT plants were grown in the same barrel in a split manner under normal growth conditions until the four- to five-leaf stage. The water supply was withheld to cause drought stress until the WT leaves became completely wilted. After recovery by rewatering for a week, the survival rates were recorded and the plants were photographed. Drought stress treatment at the reproductive stage was executed in a refined paddy field facilitated with a movable rain-off shelter by stopping the irrigation at the booting stage followed by re-watering after flowering.

The overexpression plants exhibited leaf rolling and wilted later than the WT during the course of heat stress treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

Two NAC transcription factors (NTL4 and JUB1) were demonstrated to be involved in abiotic stress responses through the regulation of ROS metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, NAC transcription factors conferring stress resistance by directly regulating ROS metabolism genes have not been reported. The present data revealed that SNAC3 is a positive regulator in response to heat and oxidative stresses in rice. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA content which accumulated in the leaves of transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>SNAC3</italic> was significantly lower than that in the control plants, and the relative ion leakage was also lower in the transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>), suggesting that the improved heat resistance of the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE plants may be due to the stronger capability to scavenge ROS under heat stress conditions to maintain a lower degree of membrane lipid peroxidation. Supporting this, overexpression of <italic>SNAC3</italic> led to the induction of many ROS-associated genes, while suppression of <italic>SNAC3</italic> caused the down-regulation of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that SNAC3 is a positive NAC regulator of heat resistance through controlling the expression of downstream genes involved in the ROS pathway.</p><p content-type="indent">The results indicated that <italic>SNAC3</italic> overexpression not only enhanced heat and oxidative tolerance, but also improved the drought resistance of the transgenic rice plants. However, distinct from the up-regulated ROS-scavenging genes and reduced accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE plants under heat stress, there were no significant differences in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation between the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE and the control plants under drought stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>), implying that <italic>SNAC3</italic> may confer heat and drought stress tolerance via different pathways. Measurements on the rates of water loss revealed that <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE plants lose water more slowly than the control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Additionally, overexpressing <italic>SNAC3</italic> increased the osmotic tolerance to mannitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). These results imply that <italic>SNAC3</italic> may regulate drought resistance mainly by reducing water loss in leaves and osmotic adjustment through unknown pathways.</p><p content-type="indent">Inadequate water supply is often accompanied by high temperature, which severely limits the yield of crops. Therefore, it is important to pyramid the genes which can increase tolerance to drought or heat stresses or to discover genes which can enhance tolerance to both drought and heat stresses (Barnab&#x000e1;s <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002). Overexpressing <italic>SNAC3</italic> can increase not only heat tolerance via enhancing the cell membrane stability and maintaining the redox homeostasis, but also drought tolerance by reducing water loss in rice. Therefore, this gene may be a promising candidate gene for genetic engineering in generating crops with improved drought and heat tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Target genes of SNAC3 and their potential roles in stress response</title><p>Transcription factors and <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements are central components of the regulation networks in plants. Identification of the direct downstream target genes is an effective strategy to elucidate the function of the SNAC3 transcription factor. Co-expression analysis indicated that five ROS-scavenging or metabolism-related genes, namely <italic>R1</italic> (LOC_Os02g02400, <italic>CATA</italic>), <italic>R6</italic> (LOC_Os04g14680, <italic>APX3</italic>), <italic>R11</italic> (LOC_Os02g34810, <italic>APX8</italic>), <italic>R45</italic> (LOC_Os08g35210, <italic>RbohF</italic>), and <italic>R54</italic> (LOC_Os02g09940, <italic>Prx IIE2</italic>), shared significant correlations with the <italic>SNAC3</italic> expression levels under normal or stress conditions. The NAC-specific NACRS and CDBS <italic>cis</italic>-elements are enriched in their promoter regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv386/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), and these genes were up-regulated in <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Yeast one-hybrid analysis further substantiated that SNAC3 can bind to the promoter regions of three of the genes (<italic>R1</italic>, <italic>R11</italic>, and <italic>R45</italic>). <italic>R1</italic>, <italic>R11</italic>, and <italic>R45</italic> encode OsCATA, OsAPX8, and OsRboh F, respectively, and they are all responsive to oxidative stress. Homologous genes of <italic>R1</italic>, <italic>R11</italic>, and <italic>R45</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> encode CAT2 (At4g35090), thylAPX (At1g77490), and NADPH oxidase F (At1g64060, AtrbohF), respectively, and their participation in the maintenance of the intracellular redox equilibrium and ROS signalling transduction has been well documented (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kalbina and Strid, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Queval <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Maruta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Mittler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). It is speculated that R1, R11, and R45 probably have similar functions in rice, and <italic>SNAC3</italic> confers heat resistance mainly through the control of the expression of these ROS-related target genes. CAT has been regarded as in charge of removing excess reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) during stress, while APX is responsible for fine-tuning of ROS signals (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Mittler, 2002</xref>). As key producers of ROS under both normal and stress conditions in plants, NADPH oxidases (Rboh/Nox) are considered as the engines of ROS signalling and involved in response to stress (Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Rbohs not only regulate a multitude of vital biological processes, but also act as pivotal signalling nodes in the ROS network and integrate a great variety of signal transduction pathways with ROS signalling (Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). <italic>OsNox6</italic> expression was found to be slightly down-regulated by drought stress and up-regulated by high temperature (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

<italic>SNAC3</italic> mediated stress responses in an ABA-independent manner</title><p>The phytohormone ABA co-ordinates a complicated network in response to various abiotic stress conditions in plants, and numerous transcription factors take part in stress responses in ABA-mediated pathways. Many stress-responsive genes contain an ABA-responsive promoter element (ABRE) recognition sequence with an ACGT core motif. Basic leucine zipper transcription factors called ABFs/AREBs such as ABF2 and AREB1 are documented to induce stress-responsive gene expression by interacting with the corresponding ABRE <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Other transcription factors including CBF4 (DREB1D), RD22BP1, and AtMYB2 are also reported to be regulated through ABA-dependent pathways (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Haake <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Several NAC transcription factors have been reported to play critical roles in the ABA-mediated stress response pathways in plants. In contrast, the present data indicated that <italic>SNAC3</italic> may exert its functions in stress resistance mainly through ABA-independent pathways. Compared with the WT, neither the <italic>SNAC3</italic>-OE nor the RNAi transgenic plants exhibited obvious changes in the sensitivity to ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">B</xref>).

In addition, overexpression of <italic>SNAC3</italic> in rice did not alter the transcript abundance of the genes which are essential for ABA biosynthesis and the signal transduction pathways (data not shown).
