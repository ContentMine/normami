MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have increasingly been shown to play important roles in rice development. Nevertheless, limited knowledge about miRNA regulation has been obtained in the early stages of rice seed germination. In this study, the small RNAs (sRNAs) from embryos of 0, 12, and 24 HAI rice seeds were sequenced to investigate the composition and expression patterns of miRNAs. The bioinformatics analysis identified 289 miRNA loci, including 59 known and 230 novel miRNAs, and 35 selected miRNAs were confirmed by stem-loop real-time RT-PCR. Expression analysis revealed that the dry and imbibed seeds have unique miRNA expression patterns compared with other tissues, particularly for the dry seeds. Using three methods, Mireap, psRNATarget and degradome analyses, 1197 potential target genes of identified miRNAs involved in various molecular functions were predicted. Among these target genes, 39 had significantly negative correlations with their corresponding miRNAs as inferred from published transcriptome data, and 6 inversely expressed miRNA-target pairs were confirmed by 5&#x002b9;-RACE assay. Our work provides an inventory of miRNA expression profiles and miRNA-target interactions in rice embryos, and lays a foundation for further studies of miRNA-mediated regulation in initial seed germination.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the the National Science Foundation of China (31101213 and 31271805), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>.

A series of physiological and biochemical events were involved in seed germination, during which embryo cells transit from a quiescent state to a metabolically active state. In rice, classical studies have defined seed germination as a sequential process following a triphasic model based on water uptake, namely, rapid water uptake in the first 20 hours after imbibition (HAI) (phase I), lag phase for metabolism reactivation (phase II, 20&#x02013;48 HAI), and radicle emergence for seedling establishment (phase III, after 48 HAI) [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Albeit no significant change has been observed in phenotypes of the 24 HAI seed, the oxygen uptake was found to be enhanced in parallel with seed wet weight increase [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During this period, the pro-mitochondria are converted to the typical cristae-rich mitochondrial structures following recovery of the aerobic respiration for seedling establishment [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous transcriptome study has shown that a significant proportion of transcripts changed in the first 24 HAI, with most changes being observed between 3 and 12 HAI (5,396 up-regulated and 4,935 down-regulated transcripts) [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, a phosphorproteome study also suggests that the first 12 HAI is a potentially important signal transduction phase for the initial rice seed germination [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the first 24 HAI greatly determines the recovery of metabolism activity in rice seed during the germination progress.</p><p>Plant microRNAs (miRNAs), generated from stem-loop regions of long primary transcripts by a Dicer-like (DCL) enzyme, are a class of non-coding sRNAs that are abundant and best-characterized with 20-24-nucleotide (nt) length [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. MicroRNAs can guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave mRNA or remodel chromatin through fully or partly complementary base pairing, resulting in mRNA slicing and degradation, translational repression, or chromatin modifications [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MicroRNAs have been shown to play important roles in plant growth and development, phyto-hormone homeostasis, and stress response. The ancient miRNAs often functionally target the evolutionarily conserved genes. For example, miR167 is involved in ovule and anther development by repressing Auxin Responsive Factor 6 (<italic>ARF6</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; Arabidopsis seeds expressing the miR160-resistant form of <italic>ARF10</italic> are hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, miR164 and miR319 are important for organ morphogenesis by targeting NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2 domain-containing proteins (<italic>NAC</italic>) and TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING (<italic>TCP</italic>) transcription factor families, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some new miRNA-target pairs have been confirmed experimentally, i.e., miR402 targets DEMETER-LIKE protein3 (<italic>DML</italic>3), a putative DNA glycosylase involved in DNA demethylation. Overexpression of miR402 and deficiency of <italic>dml3</italic> accelerates seed germination under stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As a key regulator, miRNA has been extensively studied in rice for its role in root development, seed maturation, and pollen development [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The recently released rice dataset of miRBase (V21.0) has documented 332 miRNA families. These identified miRNAs are important for understanding small RNA (sRNA)-mediated gene regulations in rice. However, to date, limited knowledge about miRNA regulation has been obtained in the early stage of rice seed germination.</p><p>Rice seed is composed of a dominant starchy endosperm and a genetically vigorous embryo. Proteomic analysis of the dissected endosperms has shown that the biological processes operating in the endosperm are heavily regulated by the embryo during seed germination [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, embryo is an important tissue in seed germination control. In this study, we sequenced the sRNA populations from embryos of 0, 12, and 24 HAI rice seeds using next-generation deep sequencing technology. A series of miRNAs were identified, including both known and novel miRNAs. We also predicted the potential targets for the miRNAs. Real-time RT-PCR and 5&#x002b9;-RACE assay were performed to confirm some deep sequencing and target prediction results. This study provides the unique composition and expression profiles of miRNAs and their potential regulations in the embryo at the early stages of rice seed germination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant Material and Seed Germination</title><p>The de-hulled rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Nipponbare) seeds were washed three times with distilled water, then placed in 9-cm-diameter plates and imbibed in distilled water at 30&#x000b0;C in a dark biochemical incubator.

The non-coding sRNAs contained various categories, including known miRNAs (2.09&#x02013;4.5%), rRNAs (4.31&#x02013;11.9%), tRNAs (1.45&#x02013;2.43%), snoRNAs (0.16&#x02013;0.21%), snRNAs (0.02&#x02013;0.03%) and unannotated sRNAs, (80.9&#x02013;84.31%). The unannotated sRNAs were further used to predict the novel miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Identification of Known and Novel miRNAs in Dry and Imbibed Rice Seeds</title><p>To scan the known miRNAs, the unique sRNAs were aligned to the rice miRNA datasets in miRBase 21 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>), allowing up to two mismatches. In the three libraries, 59 known rice miRNAs homologs from 83 precursors corresponding to 42 miRNA families were matched (<xref rid="pone.0145424.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Of which, 14 families had two or more miRNA members, and the other 28 families contained only one miRNA member. In this study, 17 conserved families were detected in the imbibed rice seeds, most of them were found in relatively high abundance. In particular, miR319, miR168, miR156, miR166, and miR159 were mapped with more than 10,000 reads (<xref rid="pone.0145424.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). However, some conserved miRNAs, i.e., miR164, mi395, and miR393, were lowly expressed in rice seeds. Nineteen families are known rice-specific miRNAs, and most of them had only one member and were in relatively low abundance. A homolog of ptc-miR6478, previously reported only in <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>, was also identified in this study. Moreover, we detected a new precursor with stringent criteria for osa-miR1862 family (named osa-MIR1862d-2). These results show that our sequencing depth was sufficient to reflect the expression profiles of miRNAs during seed imbibition.</p><p>For novel miRNAs identification, the 300-bp flanking sequences of unannotated sRNAs were initially extracted, and then subjected to MIRDeep2 to scan potential miRNA precursors with classical stem-loop structures using the default criteria. A total of 382 novel miRNA candidates with length of 18&#x02013;26 nt processed from 481 putative precursors were obtained from the three libraries. MFEI has been identified to be useful in evaluating genuine miRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which depends on the MFE, length and G+C content of the potential precursors. These criteria were used in our investigation of miRNAs in rice seeds. Low MFE is an important characteristic of miRNA precursors. In this study, the miRNA precursor&#x02019;s MFE values varied from -180.6 to 5.2 kcal&#x000b7;mol<sup>-1</sup> according to Mfold 3.2 (Figure A in <xref rid="pone.0145424.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). In animal, the size of miRNA precursor ranges typically from 70 to 80 nt, but it is more variable in plant.[<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In rice seeds, the size of miRNA precursors varied from 37 to 268 nt, with most being 51&#x02013;110 nt(Figure B in <xref rid="pone.0145424.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). In addition, the high G+C content can make the pre-miRNA secondary structure more stable and thus difficult to be processed into mature miRNA by the RISC complex [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, the G+C content ranged from 14.03% to 88% (Figure C in <xref rid="pone.0145424.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). With all these factors in consideration, we calculated the MFEI value of all identified miRNA precursors as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous research has shown that more than 90% of known plant pre-miRNAs have an MFEI value greater than 0.85 [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, the MFEI values ranged from 0.20 to 3.75, with an average of 1.26. To minimize the false positive miRNAs, we further set the novel miRNA criteria as follows: 1) the mature miRNA length ranged from 20 to 24 nt; 2) precursor had a classical fold-back structure and the length was no less than 45 nt; 3) the number of reads was greater than five in at least one library; 4) MFEI value was greater than 0.85 or the complementary miRNA* could be found. Finally, 230 novel miRNAs processed from 324 precursors were obtained (<xref rid="pone.0145424.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The detailed information was listed in <xref rid="pone.0145424.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>. Of these novel miRNAs, 218 were shared by all three libraries. The novel miRNA was denoted with OsmiR plus a serial number, such as OsmiR-1. Different miRNA precursors that produced the same mature sequence were noted with -1, -2, and -3.</p><p>In plants, most of the canonical miRNAs (&#x0223c;21 nt) are in high abundance [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, in this study, the 21-nt miRNAs occupied an overwhelming majority of the reads (<xref rid="pone.0145424.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145424.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Moreover, a great number of long miRNAs (24 nt) with low abundance existed in the early stages of rice seed germination (<xref rid="pone.0145424.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145424.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Specifically, of the 230 novel miRNAs, 176 were 24-nt. The miRNAs function through interacting with AGO proteins, which bind to the miRNA with particular 5&#x002b9; end nucleotide. AGO1 mainly recruits miRNAs that begin with a 5&#x002b9;-U/T; AGO2 prefers to bind sRNAs with 5&#x002b9; -A [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The first base distribution of all 289 identified miRNAs showed that the first base of 24-nt miRNAs were tended to be A (66.2%), suggesting these miRNAs function with AGO2; while that of the shorter miRNAs were inclined to be U/T (69.3%) (<xref rid="pone.0145424.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Genome mapping revealed that most known and novel miRNAs were located in the intergenic regions, and fewer in the intragenic regions (i.e., exon, intron). In addition, the miRNAs were located randomly on the 5p or 3p arm of their precursors (<xref rid="pone.0145424.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0145424.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145424.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Characteristics of all identified miRNAs in libraries from 0, 12 and 24 HAI rice seed embryos.</title><p>Distribution of sequencing reads <bold>(A)</bold>, number of miRNAs <bold>(B)</bold> and the first base of miRNAs <bold>(C)</bold>. <bold>(D)</bold> Genome and <bold>(E)</bold> precursor arm locations of all identified miRNAs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0145424.g003"/></fig><p>To validate the deep sequencing results, 35 (17 known and 18 novel) miRNAs with sequence reads higher than 100 were randomly selected for stem-loop RT-PCR analysis.

In order to directly plot the miRNA expression patterns in germinating rice seed, we normalized the TPM values through dividing each miRNA TPM by its corresponding maximum and reaching the abundance between 0 and 1. After normalization, one miRNA that was detected in at least one library with the normalized value lower than 0.5 (ratio &#x0003e;2 fold) was regarded as differentially expressed.

However, we identified only 83 precursors processed for 59 known miRNAs belonging to 42 families in rice seeds; this ratio is relatively lower than that in leaf, root and pollen [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, the HCL analysis and PCA indicated that the known miRNA expression profiles in the embryo of rice seeds were significantly separated from that of the leaf, root, callus and developing pollen (<xref rid="pone.0145424.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Particularly, some known miRNAs, i.e., osa-miR1876 and osa-miR5150, were abundantly expressed in rice seed but were not detected in other tissues, and osa-miR159f, osa-miR166l, and osa-miR319b were predominantly expressed in the seed, which suggested the pivotal regulatory roles of these miRNAs in seed germination. The size distribution of miRNAs has been revealed to be tissue-specific in Arabidopsis and rice [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Most of the conserved miRNAs are short sRNAs with size ranging from 20 to 22 nt [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The 24-nt miRNAs are involved in DNA methylation or histone modifications leading to transcriptional gene silencing and chromatin remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

From the above analysis, we concluded that the unique miRNAs composition and expression profiles existed in dry and imbibed rice seeds.</p><p>The composition of miRNAs in germinating rice seed was relatively stable as 277 of 289 identified miRNAs were shared by three libraries (<xref rid="pone.0145424.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), whereas their expression pattern varied greatly. Altogether, 178 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and only few miRNAs had higher TPM values in dry seeds, such as ptc-miR6478 and OsmiR-201 (Table C in <xref rid="pone.0145424.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). However, the miRNAs expression patterns between 12 and 24 HAI were similar. HCL analysis showed that the expression profile of miRNAs in 0 HAI seed embryos was separated from that of the other two time points (<xref rid="pone.0145424.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The drastic turnover of the miRNAs profile from dry seeds to imbibed seeds suggested that miRNA-mediated regulatory metabolisms were rapidly activated after imbibition.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Roles of miRNAs in Initiation of Rice Seed Germination</title><p>Since protein translation from the stored long-lived mRNAs is indispensable for seed germination, the miRNA-mediated post-transcription regulation can play key roles in the mRNA selective translation and protein turnover during this process [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To comprehensively explore the possible roles of identified miRNAs during seed imbibition, two widely accepted softwares, Mireap and PsRNATarget, were used to predict the miRNA targets. According to the miRNA-target sequence complementation, it is relatively easy to predict the plant miRNA targets with the reference genomic or transcriptomic sequence data [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the computational prediction is challenged by a high level of false positives that exist in miRNA-target pairing [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Degradome sequencing is a recently established, efficient strategy to identify miRNA targets on a large scale [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, degradome analysis was also used for targets prediction based on the published datasets. In total, 1197 target genes involved in various functions for 259 miRNAs were obtained by three prediction methods. However, the remaining 30 miRNAs were failed to find potential targets. These miRNAs might regulate gene expression through non-stringent complementary paring, such as translational repression [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], or guide the non-coding locus cleavage and produce phasi/tasiRNA [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. GO enrichment results indicated that target genes involved in anatomical structure development and multicellular organismal development, i.e., wall-associated protein kinases (<italic>OsWAK</italic>s), expansin precursors, and <italic>OsSPL</italic>s, were over-represented. This is consistent with the development process of germination initiation, during which many cell structures need to be repaired or synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>. Unexpectedly, only 25 miRNA-target pairs overlapped in the three methods of analysis. The ultra-low overlap among these target prediction methods reflected a difference in the parameter setting or prediction principle. This is also strongly suggestive of the predicted targets which need to be confirmed experimentally since the result varied with different prediction methods.</p><p>Transcription factors such as <italic>TCP</italic>s, <italic>ARF</italic>s and <italic>SPL</italic>s have been confirmed to be easily targeted by conserved miRNAs. By repressing <italic>TCP</italic>s, miR319 played a central role in coordinating multiple miRNAs (i.e., miR396 and miR164) and phytohormones (including auxin, ABA and GA) pathways to control lateral organ development [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Auxin alone is not generally considered as a typical seed germination hormone, but it was revealed to interact with ABA through <italic>ARF10</italic> targeted by miR160 and to be involved in seed germination and post-germination control [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The auxin signal affects rice root development through regulation of miR156-SPLs [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. SPL proteins have also been revealed to restrain the transition from post-germination to autotrophic growth and affect seedling establishment [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study, osa-miR319 and osa-miR156abcdejl showed high abundance, but miR160abe was relatively low-expressed in all three libraries. Since the complex biological process of seed germination is regulated by a great interaction network of phytohormones, these conserved miRNAs are devoted to the germination initiation and the following seedling establishment through targeting the related signaling regulation factors. However, until now, the mechanisms of miRNAs-mediated phytohormone crosstalk involving in seed germination are largely unknown.</p><p>The first 24 HAI is critical for initiation of rice seed germination, during which RNA transcription, metabolism resumption and cellular repair are highly activated [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. According to the published transcriptome data, 28 miRNAs were found to be expressed remarkably opposite to their targeted genes (Table B in <xref rid="pone.0145424.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>), including conserved miRNAs, i.e., miR169ijk targeted nuclear factors, miR390 targeted ATP binding proteins, and miR166e targeted SGT1 protein, which are known to participate in plant development and disease resistance [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Novel miRNA-target pairs provide useful information to explore the new functions of miRNAs in rice seed germination. For example, OsmiR-129 sharply increased during seed imbibition, it might reduce the phytic acid synthesis in rice seeds by targeting a multi-drug resistance-associated ABC transporter and release micronutrients and organic phosphorus for seed germination [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Notably, among those inversely expressed miRNA-target pairs, several miRNAs were found to target genes with unknown function, i.e., OsmiR-100 (LOC_Os07g07030), OsmiR-217 (LOC_Os07g08669), OsmiR-232 (LOC_Os05g06910). It is worth in-depth investigation on the roles of those miRNA-target pairs in the seed germination regulation.</p><p>The expression level of miRNAs are not only inversely but sometimes also positively correlated with their target genes for feedback regulation or other interference factors [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, many differentially expressed miRNAs were identified to be positively correlated with their target genes, such as OsmiR-201. OsmiR-201 is highly expressed in dry seeds but the expression decreases rapidly during imbibition. Three potential targets of OsmiR-201, LOC_Os05g50660 (encoding a PX domain containing protein), LOC_Os01g69940 (encoding an F-box domain containing protein), and LOC_Os01g62800 (encoding a methyltransferase) decrease during seed imbibition. Exploring whether the feedback regulations exist in these kinds of miRNA-target pairs will help to understand the miRNA-mediated regulations from a new angle.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>MicroRNA Mediates the Crosstalk between ABA and GA in Controlling Rice Seed Germination</title><p>ABA is well documented as a seed dormancy maintainer that functions antagonistically to GA. MicroRNA159 has been reported extensively to be involved in the crosstalk between ABA and GA through cleavage of <italic>GAMYB</italic>-like genes in leaves, flowers, seed maturation and germination process [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In Arabidopsis seeds, exogenous ABA results in the accumulation of miR159 that participates in the regulation of seed germination by targeting MYB33 and MYB101, two positive regulators of ABA response [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This negative feedback might contribute to the developmental switch from seed dormancy to germination in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In rice, expression of miR159 was detected in various organs except in seeds. However, its target genes, <italic>OsGAMYBL1</italic> and <italic>OsGAMYB</italic>, which regulate almost all GA-regulated genes in aleuronic cells, are highly expressed in the seed aleurone layer and promote storage hydrolysis during seed germination [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The expression level of miR159 is found to be very low in the embryo of non-dormant maize seeds [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Unexpectedly, in this study, we identified abundant miR159, especially miR159f, in the embryos of germinating rice seeds. In addition, we observed that miR519 was insensitive to ABA or GA. Thus, the plentiful miR159 in rice embryo cannot be induced by ABA as it is in Arabidopsis. RACE analysis verified that <italic>OsGAMYBL1</italic> and <italic>OsGAMYB</italic> were both cleaved by miR159 at the canonical positions. Meanwhile, <italic>OsGAMYB</italic> (the ortholog of Arabidopsis MYB33) was detected to be down-regulated by RT-PCR and microarray analysis in the embryos of germinating rice seeds (<xref rid="pone.0145424.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145424.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). It is of interest to reveal the distinctive expression patterns of osa-miR159 and the role of osa-miR159 mediated crosstalk between ABA and GA in the embryo of germinating rice seed in future studies.</p><p>Two other targets potentially involved in the ABA signaling were also verified by 5&#x002b9;-RACE. One is <italic>OSK3</italic>, targeted by rice known miRNA osa-miR1428e-3p. <italic>OSK3</italic> has been identified as an important gene for starch accumulation in the early stages of rice endosperm development [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. During seed germination, most proteins related to rice endosperm development are rapidly degraded [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>OSK3</italic> was detected to decrease drastically by RT-PCR in seed imbibition. <italic>OSK3</italic> belongs to the sucrose non-fermenting related kinase 1 (<italic>SnRK1</italic>) family, which is well documented as a central component of the regulatory response to glucose starvation and participates in ABA signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, RT-PCR results showed that <italic>OSK3</italic> was insensitive to ABA or GA in the embryo of germinating rice seed, suggesting that the function of <italic>OSK3</italic> might be regulated by ABA at the post-translational level. In contrast, osa-miR1428e-3p was induced significantly by GA, implying that GA displayed antagonistic role to ABA through up-regulating the inhibitor of the positive regulator in ABA signaling. Gene <italic>LOC_Os11g37540</italic> encoding a PP2C domain containing protein was predicted to be targeted by a novel miRNA OsmiR-203. Rice has 90 PP2C proteins, and most of them participate in ABA signaling by interacting with SnRKs and suppressing SnRKs activation through dephosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues in the activation loop [<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145424.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, the RT-PCR results indicated that <italic>LOC_Os11g37540</italic> was insensitive to ABA or GA, and OsmiR-203 was slightly increased by GA but inhibited by ABA.
