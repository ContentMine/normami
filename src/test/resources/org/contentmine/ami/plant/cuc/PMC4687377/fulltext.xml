Soybean production contributes billions of dollars annually to the national economy, providing approximately 21 billion dollars in 2012 (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization website). Limitations on maximum production are largely due to disease pressures that reduce yield. Several species of <italic>Fusarium</italic> have been associated with soybean, causing seed and seedling diseases, root rot, and vascular wilt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> Schltdl. is a fungal soil-borne facultative parasite present worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is the most common species isolated from soybean roots in Iowa and other soybean-producing regions in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> is known to consist of many &#x0201c;cryptic species&#x0201d; and, as such, it is often referred as the &#x0201c;<italic>F. oxysporum</italic> species complex&#x0201d; (FOSC). Recently, significant variation in aggressiveness was observed among isolates within the FOSC collected from soybean roots in Iowa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some of these isolates caused severe root rot and dumping-off, other isolates were weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic.</p><p>Management of soil-borne diseases like <italic>Fusarium</italic> root rot and wilt disease depends primarily on seed treatments and genetic resistance. Seed treatments are only effective during emergence and the seedling stages. Cultural practices can help in managing root rots, but these are often not adequate. Moreover, it seems clear that managing <italic>Fusarium</italic> root rot in the long-term will depend on improvements in molecular breeding for resistant genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Soybean resistance to other <italic>Fusarium</italic> species has been identified. Particularly high levels of resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> have been found in the soybean cultivar Conrad, and putative QTL associated with resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> have been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous work has identified QTL associated with resistance to sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by <italic>F. virguliforme</italic> and other species, in Ripley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Forrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] soybean genotypes. Progress in breeding for resistance will be improved through the analysis of new and consistent QTL for <italic>Fusarium</italic> root rot and wilt disease and by a deeper knowledge of genetic mechanisms underlying soybean-<italic>F. oxysporum</italic> interactions.</p><p>The availability of reference genome sequences and gene annotations for <italic>G. max</italic> and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> has enabled us to study the molecular interactions between the host plant and its pathogen. Emerging massively parallel sequencing techniques allow the rapid acquisition of huge amounts of genomic or transcriptomic sequence data at relatively low costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To date, microarray techniques have been predominantly used for gene expression analysis particularly for well-studied model organisms for which typically high-quality gene annotation data were available. Compared with microarrays, RNA-Seq is known to have a wider dynamic range, higher technical reproducibility, and provide a better estimate of absolute expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Genome-wide expression profiling of plants infected with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> has been reported in several crop plant species, including melon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and banana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, little is known about transcriptional changes in soybean roots that have been infected by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and almost no attention has been paid to the study of differences in plant responses based on the pathogenicity of the infecting isolates. Most likely this is because of the scarce availability of isolates able to infect the same host while displaying a range of pathogenicity. This situation draws considerable interest in comparing root transcriptional responses between non-pathogenic and pathogenic <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> isolates.</p><p>To elucidate the comprehensive gene expression profiles for both <italic>G. max</italic> and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, we analysed the transcriptomes of plants and non-pathogenic and pathogenic fungi at 72 and 96&#x000a0;h post inoculation (hpi). Our aim was to characterize soybean genes that are differentially regulated by the host during infection by each pathogen, in order to identify new potential resistance mechanisms and candidate genes that have not previously been shown to play a role in defense. At the same time, we tried to strengthen our knowledge concerning novel details of infection by using two different pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. The results showed markedly different gene expression profiles in different host-pathogen combinations. A peak of HDEGs was observed at 72 hpi in soybean roots in response to both isolates and the number of HDEGs was about eight times higher for the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one. Furthermore, not only the number of genes, but also the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. These findings generated useful resources for the soybean research community and provided more insights into the understanding of soybean-<italic>F. oxysporum</italic> interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantification of fungal growth and disease severity evaluation in soybean roots</title><p>To determine the appropriate time points for the investigation of soybean transcriptome profiles following the FO36 (non-pathogenic) and FO40 (pathogenic) <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> isolates inoculation, quantification of the fungal <italic>translation elongation factor</italic> 1 <italic>alpha</italic> (<italic>tef</italic>1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) gene by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out in this study.

The <italic>tef</italic>1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> gene was detected in samples collected 48&#x000a0;h post inoculation (hpi) through 168 hpi with both isolates. Two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant (P&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001) differences between the times of sampling (48, 72, 96 and 168 hpi) in the observed means for the fungal <italic>tef</italic>1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> DNA quantity and between the two treatments (non-pathogenic and pathogenic inoculated samples), and their interactions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p>The highest quantity of fungal DNA was measured at seven days, and five times more fungal DNA (3.81&#x000a0;ng vs. 0.75&#x000a0;ng) was detected for the interaction with the pathogenic isolate (FO40) vs. the non-pathogenic isolate (FO36) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This profile was indicative of an enhanced reaction of compatibility between the host and the pathogenic isolate, compared to the non-pathogenic one, at the later stages of inoculation and it suggests that the plant may already react to the invading pathogens in the first 96&#x000a0;h. Therefore, 72 and 96 hpi were selected as the crucial time points for RNA-Seq analysis, because they were intended to take into account not only the plant defense responses at the early-intermediate stages of infection, but also to allow the detection of pathogen transcripts when infection was established.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Amount of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> constitutive gene <italic>translation elongation factor</italic> 1 <italic>alpha</italic> in roots of resistant Forrest soybean genotype inoculated with isolates FO36 (<bold>white boxes</bold>) and FO40 (<bold>grey boxes</bold>) of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, over a time course of 168&#x000a0;h.

To investigate the comprehensive gene expression profiles of <italic>G. max</italic> and its pathogen <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> simultaneously at the early stages of infection, we analysed transcriptomes obtained from sequencing RNA from eighteen samples, which included three biological replicates for each condition (control/inoculated) and times of inoculation (72 and 96 hpi). A total of about 126, 121 and 140 million 100&#x000a0;bp paired-end reads were generated from noninoculated, FO36 and FO40-inoculated samples, respectively, constituting approximately 12.6, 12.1 and 14 Gb of cDNA sequencing data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). On average, 87.2&#x000a0;% of the total reads mapped uniquely to the soybean Williams 82 reference genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). A smaller number of uniquely aligned reads mapped to the <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> reference genome (90,770 in total), and 54,965 aligned reads were from the pathogenic isolate at 96 hpi (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The fungal mapping results were consistent with the fungal DNA quantities assessed by qPCR, where fungal DNA increased throughout the course of infection, in particular for the pathogenic isolate, confirming the larger amount of reads detected for this isolate in the later inoculation stage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).</p><p>Unfortunately, given the very low read counts of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, in particular for the non-pathogenic isolate, further downstream analyses were only performed for soybean and not for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. The abundance of soybean transcripts are expressed in upper quartile normalized counts as calculated by HTSeq-count and QuasiSeq programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One of the three biological replicates for the FO36 inoculated sample at 96 hpi was excluded for further expression level analysis due to a relatively small number of reads. We detected in total 44,026 soybean known protein coding expressed genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3).</p><p>Soybean expression profiles of FO36 and FO40 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> isolates inoculated roots were compared with their respective noninoculated controls at 72 hpi and 96 hpi. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed (DE) if the Qvalue cut-off was below 0.05 and highly differentially expressed (HDE) if the absolute fold change (FC) was&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>RNA-Seq analysis identified 8,471 DEGs. Significant enrichment testing was performed for GO categories and Mercator bins. A Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to determine GO term enrichment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.soybase.org/goslimgraphic_v2/dashboard.php">http://www.soybase.org/goslimgraphic_v2/dashboard.php</ext-link>) on DEGs with a Qvalue less than 0.05. Soybean version 2 gene models were further annotated into Mercator functional categories that are easily visualized as MapMan bins and a Wilcox Rank Sum test inside MapMan identified several significantly enriched bins (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Tables S4 and S5). Due to the high number of DEGs an additional filter of a FC greater than 1.9 was applied for downstream analysis and visualization. This filter resulted in 1,802 soybean HDEGs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S6).

We identified 203 and 57 HDEGs in response to the non-pathogenic isolate, and 1,659 and 151 HDEGs in response to the pathogenic isolate at 72 and 96 hpi, respectively. A higher number of HDEGs was observed at 72 hpi compared to 96 hpi and this number was always higher in response to the pathogenic isolate at both times of inoculations. Some overlap in the HDEGs identified between the isolates was observed at 72 hpi, where more than 50&#x000a0;% of HDEGs detected in response to the non-pathogenic isolate was in common with the pathogenic one; however larger changes in expression levels were specifically identified in the interaction with the pathogenic isolate (1,441 HDEGs; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). More limited transcriptional changes were found at 96 hpi, although the host responses against the pathogenic isolate continued to be numerically higher.</p><p>In order to understand the biological processes associated with host reactions to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection, soybean HDEGs were assigned to different functional categories (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After discarding genes with unassigned function, in both interactions the largest proportion of HDEGs belonged to metabolic process and defense-related functional classes, such as resistance, response to stress, cell wall and secondary metabolism. In the interaction with the non-pathogenic isolate, metabolic process and defense-related functions accounted for 28.1 and 37&#x000a0;% of the modulated genes at 72 hpi, falling to 24.6 and 19.4&#x000a0;% at 96 hpi, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a and c</xref>). An opposite trend was observed in response to the pathogenic isolate and the two functional classes accounted for about 19&#x02013;21&#x000a0;% at 72 hpi, increasing to 31&#x02013;32&#x000a0;% in the later stage of inoculation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and d</xref>). Moreover, while at 72 hpi a similar percentage of up and down-regulated genes within each category was modulated in either of the interactions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a and b</xref>), at 96 hpi the majority of HDEGs was down-regulated in response to the non-pathogenic isolate, and up-regulated in response to the pathogenic one (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c and d</xref>). These results suggest markedly different molecular events occurred in response to the two isolates. Even though soybean also activated a certain number of metabolic and defense events against the non-pathogenic isolate in the earlier phases of root colonization, the small number of modulated genes identified at 96 hpi, 72&#x000a0;% of which down-regulated, confirms the lower efficiency in infection and spread of the non-pathogenic isolate.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Functional categories of highly differentially expressed genes (HDEGs) in Forrest genotype after <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> FO36 and FO40 isolate inoculation at 72 (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>) and 96 (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>) hours post inoculation (hpi).

The data show clearly that most of the transcriptional modulation observed in response to the pathogenic isolate had no parallel for the non-pathogenic one, confirming that many of the changes in all functional categories were restricted to FO40 isolate. In contrast, most of the transcriptional modulation observed in response to FO36 also occurred in response to FO40 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Specificity of transcriptional changes within each functional category in inoculated partially resistant soybean genotype Forrest.

At 96 hpi, only five genes were induced in response to FO40 isolate, with the highest expression value of 83.3 NC, while no genes were found in response to the non-pathogenic isolate.

We therefore began this investigation by characterizing the infection process in soybean roots inoculated with FO36 and FO40 isolates, in order to determine the optimal sampling times after inoculation. Quantification of fungal growth and disease severity evaluation reported more fungal DNA and elevated symptoms at 168 hpi, and as expected, in particular in response to the pathogenic isolate. As a consequence, this time-point was excluded from the further RNA-Seq analysis, because considered as a too late sample timing. Therefore, 72 and 96 hpi were selected to investigate early-intermediate transcriptional changes, in order to elucidate host genetic responses.</p><p>Our study provides the first large-scale investigation of gene expression changes that occur when soybean is inoculated with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, and is the first to compare pathogenic and non-pathogenic interactions in the same genetic background, using the partially resistant Forrest genotype. We have identified 205 soybean genes that are highly differentially expressed in pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates versus control that encode for enzymes that are well known to be involved in defense-related networks. Of these genes, 90 were found to be significantly enriched in GO categories as determined by a Fisher&#x02019;s exact or in MapMan bin categories by a Wilcox Rank Sum test (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Tables S5 and S8). Although the remaining 114 genes were not enriched into one of the defined categories or bins, their known relevance in the defense response literature warrants their further investigation. We placed these genes into four broad categories: signalling-related, defense response, transcriptional regulation, and modulation of secondary and sugar metabolism-related and explored their expression below.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Expression of signalling-related genes</title><p>Plants are able to recognize potential microbial pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host sensors, known as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that initiate a series of defense responses called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI).

In our study five leucine-rich repeat (LRR) type-RLK were identified at 72 hpi in response to the FO40 isolate, four of them up-regulated.

In our research, a high number of genes representing most of 17 different PR were clearly identified as induced after inoculation mainly in the early time point often shared by both isolates, such as three PR10, one PR4, one PR1 and four chitinases (family PR3). Other PR genes up-regulated only in response to the FO40 isolate at 72 hpi included: thaumatin-like proteins (family PR5; four genes), endoglucanases (family PR2; four genes) and lignin forming peroxidase (family PR9; one gene). Furthermore, the same three PR10 proteins and three out of four chitinases induced by both pathogens at 72 hpi, were also specifically up-regulated at 96 hpi in response to the pathogenic isolate but not by FO36. The same trend was also observed for two germin proteins (Glyma.10G168900; Glyma.20G220800), which are known to function in ROS production and biotic and abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Two additional FO40-induced genes encoding bon1-associated proteins (BAP) were up-regulated at 72 hpi in FO40-inoculated roots. BAP1 and BAP2 are homologous proteins containing a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain and both function in the defense pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, several nodulin proteins were strongly induced by FO40 at 72 hpi. Interestingly, one of them continued to be induced at 96 hpi for the pathogenic isolate (Glyma.15G049600), whereas three of them were down-regulated after non-pathogenic inoculation, suggesting a potential role in plant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>In our analysis another prominent class of defense-related genes was represented by protease inhibitors.

It could be speculated that the defense responses initiated at the early stage of fungal pathogen infection continued to play a role at the later stage following infection by isolate FO40, while these responses dropped off after 72 hpi for the non-pathogenic isolate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Genes involved in transcriptional regulation</title><p>Transcriptome profiling analysis identified a large number of genes encoding TFs, such as ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERF), MYB, bHLH, GATA, PLATZ and WRKY, and found that their expression was significantly changed upon FO40 inoculation.

The ERF TFs are known to be involved in ethylene signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and in agreement with this we also found that the pathogenic isolate infection up-regulated five genes for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidases at 72 hpi.

More specifically, phenylpropanoid-related genes, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate ligase (4CL), trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4M) and caffeoyl-o-methyltransferase (COMT) were consistently modulated upon pathogenic isolate inoculation mainly at the early time point. RNA-Seq data also revealed significant changes in genes belonging to the flavonoid pathway upon inoculation, especially with the FO40 isolate, such as chalcone isomerase (CI), flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and flavonol synthase (FS), as well as two terpene synthases (TPs) that were identified.

Additionally, pathogens try to manipulate plant carbohydrate metabolism for their own needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In our study, we identified eight up-regulated genes belonging to the carbohydrate metabolic process group, seven out of them specifically induced after pathogenic inoculation at 72 hpi, and one cell wall invertase (CWI) (Glyma.15G024600) induced by the same isolate at both time points. Enhanced expression and activity of CWIs has been reported in several plant-pathogen interactions and is essential to modulate sugar partitioning necessary for the pathogen development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Moreover, during infection CWI activity also triggers plant defense responses, such as induction of PR genes, PAL gene expression, callose deposition and reduction of cell death, in agreement with our previous finding. One of the other possibilities for changing the sugar content is the regulation of the expression of the sugar transporters. We observed the up-regulation of five bidirectional sugar transporters only in response to the FO40 isolate at 72 hpi. In rice infected by <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>Oryzae</italic>, SWEET proteins were up-regulated and sucrose accumulated in apoplast ready to be used for the pathogen growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

This response included a stronger activation of many well-known defense-related genes, and several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, TFs, secondary and sugar metabolism.

RNA-Seq libraries were prepared by the Iowa State University DNA Facility and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). 100-bp paired-end reads were generated. Mapping of the RNA-Seq data was performed at the Genome Informatics Facility, Iowa State University. Short read sequences were aligned to the soybean Williams 82 reference genome (Glyma.Wm82.a2.v1 genome assembly 2 annotation version 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.soybase.org">http://www.soybase.org</ext-link>) using GSNAP software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Only uniquely mapped reads were considered for downstream differential expression analysis. Soybean gene models were downloaded from Joint Genome Institute and read counts for each gene model were obtained using the HTSeq program developed by Anders and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Differential expression analysis was performed using the QuasiSeq package in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For DE analysis, pathogenic isolate (FO40) was compared against non-pathogenic isolate (FO36) at each time point. Upper quartile normalization was used to normalize the read counts for library size. In QuasiSeq, the QLSpline method was used to account for over-dispersion effects. To account for multiple testing, we estimated the Qvalues for each gene model. To control false discovery rate at 5&#x000a0;%, gene models with Qvalues less than 0.05 were declared DE and gene models with Qvalues less than 0.05 and absolute value of FC&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.9 were declared to be HDE. For the analysis of fungal genes, the short read sequences were aligned to combined soybean and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>pisi</italic> HDV247 NRRL 37622 reference genome <italic>F.oxysporum</italic> HDV247 genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/">http://www.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>). Due to the very small number of fungal reads, the further normalized expression analysis of transcripts was not performed for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Soybean GO categories were downloaded from Soybase.org. GO term enrichment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.soybase.org/goslimgraphic_v2/dashboard.php">http://www.soybase.org/goslimgraphic_v2/dashboard.php</ext-link>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]) was determined on DEGs with a Qvalue less than 0.05. Mercator functional categories that are easily visualized as MapMan bins were annotated for all gene models. A Wilcox Rank Sum test inside MapMan was used to identify several significantly enriched bins (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Tables S4 and S5). Due to the high number of DEGs an additional filter of a fold change greater than 1.9 was applied for downstream analysis and visualization and we refer to these gene as HDEGs.</p><p>Sequences of HDEGs were compared with National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non redundant (NR) database with a Blast E-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and were functionally annotated using Blast2GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] assigning a GO term and a metabolic pathway in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to the query sequences. Sequences were classified into 13 functional categories (Cell component; Cell wall; Electron/Energy; Metabolic process; Miscellanea; Photosynthesis; Proteolysis; Response to stress; Resistance; Secondary metabolism; Signal transduction; Transport; Unknown function) based on GO annotation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data deposition</title><p>The sequencing data have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under the accession number of GSE66861.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Real-time RT-PCR validation analysis</title><p>Gene expression data from RNA-Seq analysis were validated by real-time RT-PCR. This was performed on selected soybean genes that were up- or down-regulated at 72 and 96 hpi. A 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g sample of total RNA after DNAse I treatment (Qiagen) was used for cDNA synthesis following the iScript cDNA synthesis kit protocol (Bio-Rad). Twenty ng of single strand cDNA determined by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) were used for real-time RT-PCR.

A melting curve analysis, ranging from 60 to 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, was used to identify different amplicons, including non-specific products. Three technical replicates (within each biological replicate) were employed for each tested sample and template-free negative controls.
