The presence of either of these DRB proteins is crucial to determine the mode of action of a miRNA; i.e., cleavage or translation inhibition. Here we studied the structural determinants for the role of DRB1 and DRB2 in the miRNA pathway. We developed a series of chimeric vectors encoding different functional domains of DRB1 and DRB2, and expressed these in the <italic>drb1</italic> mutant background in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under the control of the native DRB1 promoter. Complementation of the <italic>drb1</italic> developmental phenotype was used to assess the biological role that each functional domain of DRB1 and DRB2 mediates in the miRNA-guided transcript cleavage pathway. The DRB1 amino acid sequence differs considerably to that of DRB2, and analysis of <italic>drb1</italic> transgenic lines revealed that the first dsRNA-binding domains of DRB1 and DRB2 are functionally similar; in contrast, the dsRBD2 of DRB1 and DRB2 appear functionally distinct. Our bioinformatic analysis further suggests that the C-terminal domain of DRB2 mediates a functional role in the miRNA pathway, whereas its counterpart in DRB1 is known to be dispensable. Our results provide evidence for the differences between DRB1 and DRB2 proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, which may be essential for the selection of the miRNA regulatory mechanisms, and suggest that these features are conserved among land plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DRB1</kwd><kwd>HYL1</kwd><kwd>DRB2</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>dsRNA binding domain</kwd><kwd>chimera</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA BINDING1 (DRB1) is a well characterized partnering protein of DCL1 and is required for accurate and efficient processing of miRNA/miRNA<sup>&#x02217;</sup> duplexes from their respective precursor transcripts (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kurihara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2008</xref>). DRB1 also mediates the preferential selection of miRNA guide strands over the corresponding duplex strand (the miRNA<sup>&#x02217;</sup> passenger strand) for loading into the ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1)-catalyzed RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Eamens et al., 2009</xref>). DRB2 is also a DCL1 partnering protein (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Eamens et al., 2012</xref>). We have recently shown that DRB1 is required only for miRNA-guided transcript cleavage, whereas DRB2 represses <italic>DRB1</italic> transcription and is required for the translational inhibition pathway (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Reis et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, although DCL1 is the ribonuclease III that excises miRNA/miRNA<sup>&#x02217;</sup> duplexes from precursor transcripts, its DRB partnering protein defines the miRNA mode of action.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, genes encoding three additional DRB proteins&#x02014;DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5&#x02014;are present and each DRB is characterized by two amino-terminal dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Curtin et al., 2008</xref>). dsRBD-containing proteins have been identified in most eukaryotes, are typically 70 amino acid residues in length, fold into an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1; structure, mediate dsRNA recognition and binding, and can also bridge protein-protein interactions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Ramos, 2005</xref>). In a canonical dsRNA binding domain, three regions of contact with the dsRNA molecule can be distinguished: regions 1 and 2 bind the dsRNA minor groove, while region three binds the major groove (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gleghorn and Maquat, 2014</xref>). The regions are characterized by positive electrostatic surface, with region two featuring a GPxH motif.</p><p>The structures of both dsRBD domains of DRB1, termed dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, respectively, have been determined (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). These revealed that dsRBD1 adopts a canonical dsRBD structure; i.e., it has the structural features found in most dsRNA binding domains. Interestingly, dsRBD2 is structurally distinct and its predicted low affinity for the dsRNA substrates of DRB1 has been explained by deviations from the canonical structure in region 2 (the loop that recognizes the dsRNA minor groove), and to a lesser extent in the &#x003b1;-helices that recognize both the minor and major dsRNA grooves (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The same authors also showed that DRB1 binds 21-nucleotide (nt) dsRNA as a homodimer, probably mediated by its dsRBD2. More recently, DRB1 homodimerization has been further characterized, with the role of dsRBD2 shown to be crucial to ensure the position of DCL1-catalyzed pri-miRNA cleavage (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, disruption of DRB1 homodimerization did not impair DRB1 interaction with DCL1, or the pri-miRNA binding affinity of DRB1.</p><p>Engineered chimeric genes coding for different combinations of dsRBDs have been widely used to study their functions in humans and plants. In humans, a single dicer protein processes both pre-miRNAs and pre-siRNAs in association with DRB proteins, namely protein activator of PKR (PACT) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>trans</italic>-activation response RNA-binding protein (TRBP; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chendrimada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Haase et al., 2005</xref>), respectively. Animal miRNAs primarily guide translation inhibition, while short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide transcript cleavage. <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2013)</xref> showed that in humans this dichotomy is partially aided by Dicer association with either PACT or TRBP. PACT was found to inhibit the processing of pre-siRNA substrates by Dicer, and experiments with chimeric versions of PACT and TRBP demonstrated that the two N-terminal RNA-binding domains of each protein confer their differential function. Chimeric versions of DRB proteins have also been used to unravel the structural components of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> RDE-4 required to bind dsRNA, interact with dicer DCR-1 and activate DCR-1 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a chimeric DRB protein containing the canonical TRBP2 dsRBD2 fused to the non-canonical DRB1 dsRBD2 compensated for DRB1 dsRBD1 by rescuing the <italic>drb1</italic> severe phenotype (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), providing evidence that certain dsRNA binding domains are primarily involved in the recognition and binding of dsRNA; e.g., DRB1 dsRBD1.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the dsRBD1 domain of DRB1 is functionally similar to the corresponding domain in DRB2, whereas their dsRBD2 domains are functionally distinct. We also show that, while the C-terminal of DRB1 appears functionally redundant, its counterpart in DRB2 is functional. These results provide insights into the structural determinants of DRB1 and DRB2 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and into the miRNA-guided transcript cleavage pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Lines and Growth Conditions</title><p>The <italic>drb1</italic> T-DNA knockout insertion has been described previously (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Curtin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Eamens et al., 2012</xref>).

To investigate the structural components that direct the functional activity of DRB1, and that differentiate it from DRB2 in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miRNA pathway, we transformed <italic>drb1</italic> plants with a series of chimeric vectors. Each vector harbored coding sequences for DRB1 and DRB2 as full-length, truncations or rearrangements. The <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of these chimeric vectors, termed DRB-C1 to DRB-C9, was driven by the native DRB1 promoter. Homozygous plants were identified in the T2 generation and further selected by gene expression of chimeras relative to endogenous <italic>DRB1</italic> in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Col-0). The assessment of each chimera&#x02019;s expression level was performed such that all selected transgenic plants had chimeric genes at levels similar to endogenous DRB1 in wild-type plants. Transgenic plants were then visually assessed for comparison to wild-type and <italic>drb1</italic> plants.</p><p>Previous work has shown that <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of both N-terminal dsRBDs of DRB1 lacking its C-terminal region, when driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter, was sufficient for complementation of the severe <italic>drb1</italic> developmental phenotype (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we observed that the expression of DRB1 full-length (DRB-C1) or DRB1 N-terminal dsRBDs (DRB-C2), driven by the <italic>DRB1</italic> endogenous promoter in a <italic>drb1</italic> mutant background (<italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C1 and <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C2 plants), also allowed for phenotypic complementation of this mutant (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). This further confirms that the N-terminal dsRBDs fulfill the function of the whole DRB1. However, transformation of <italic>drb1</italic> mutant plants with chimeric genes lacking the non-canonical DRB1 dsRBD2 (DRB-C5, C6 and C8) failed to complement the severe phenotype. Transgenic lines <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C5, <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C6 and <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C8 displayed the <italic>drb1</italic>-like phenotype, showing that the non-canonical domain of DRB1 is essential for its <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. This also revealed that <italic>DRB2</italic> under control of the endogenous promoter of <italic>DRB1</italic> (<italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C8 plants) is not capable of complementing <italic>drb1</italic> phenotype, whereas under control of the strong and constitutive 35S promoter, <italic>DRB2</italic> can compensate for <italic>DRB1</italic> null mutation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Eamens et al., 2012</xref>). This is in accordance with the lower affinity of DRB2 for DCL1 as compared with that of DRB1 protein (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kurihara et al., 2006</xref>), and further suggests that DRB2 can only compensate for DRB1 at elevated levels in order to compensate for its lower affinity.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotype and ABA response of wild-type, <italic>drb1</italic> and transgenic plants.</bold> Col-0 wild-type, <italic>drb1</italic>, and <italic>drb1</italic> transformed with either DRB1 (DRB-C1), dsRNA binding domains of DRB1 (DRB-C2), or a chimeric gene (DRB-C3 to DRB-C9), driven by the endogenous promoter sequence of <italic>Arabidopsis DRB1</italic>.

Approximately 10 homozygous transgenic plants were analyzed for each construct. All transgenic plants expressing the empty vector or DRB-C3, C5-C8 failed to complement the <italic>drb1</italic> phenotype. Transgenic plants expressing DRB-C1, C2, C4, and C9 showed wild-type phenotype in 10 out of 10 plants (10/10), 9/9, 9/10, 9/11, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-06-01201-g001"/></fig><p>The DRB-C7 chimeric gene also failed to complement the <italic>drb1</italic> phenotype. In the DRB-C7 chimeric gene, the canonical first dsRBD of DRB1 was replaced with DRB2 dsRBD2, which was predicted to fold into a canonical RBD (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C7 plants showed a <italic>drb1</italic>-like phenotype, suggesting that (i) DRB2 RBD2 is a non-canonical dsRNA binding domain or (ii) it mediates specific protein&#x02013;protein interaction(s) different to those of DRB1. DRB1 interaction with its partnering proteins has been shown to require its second dsRNA binding domain (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>); hence, it is likely that the second dsRNA binding domain of DRB2 plays a similar role in mediating protein-protein interactions.</p><p>Although the C-terminal region of DRB1 appears to be dispensable for its function (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2007</xref>), the transformation of <italic>drb1</italic> with chimeric genes harboring the DRB2 C-terminal region (DRB-C3 and DRB-C9) resulted in different phenotypes. DRB-C3 has the DRB1 dsRNA binding domains fused to the C-terminus of DRB2, and <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C3 plants displayed a <italic>drb1</italic>-like phenotype (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). The DRB-C9 chimeric gene, however, is similar to DRB-C3, with the difference that it has the first dsRBD of DRB1 replaced by DRB2 dsRBD1. Interestingly, the <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C9 phenotype was closely related to wild-type, but also had some hyponastic leaves, characteristic of <italic>drb1</italic> mutants. These results show that the DRB2 C-terminus can impair DRB1 function in the absence of DRB2 dsRBD1, suggesting that these domains may interact. In addition, the DRB-C4 chimeric gene has the first RBD of DRB1 replaced by DRB2 RBD1, and <italic>drb1</italic>/DRB-C4 is wild-type in appearance. Although it is possible that certain chimeric combinations may lead to disruption of protein tertiary structure, this is unlikely as several dsRBD chimeric combinations have been previously shown to be functional (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is still possible that the chimeric genes that failed to complement the <italic>drb1</italic> phenotype are non-functional because of improper folding, altered posttranscriptional modification (e.g., phosphorylation) or posttranscriptional regulation (e.g., loss of binding site). These are all interesting avenues for further studies, and our results present a comprehensive picture of domain swapping that, due to incompatibility or non-functionality, give combinations impaired in their ability to complement the <italic>drb1</italic> phenotype. These results also suggest that the dsRBD1 of DRB1 and DRB2 are functionally similar in the miRNA pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Abscisic Acid Treatment of the <italic>drb1</italic> Transgenic Lines</title><p>It has been previously demonstrated that <italic>drb1</italic> seed germination is inhibited by exogenous ABA application (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lu and Fedoroff, 2000</xref>).

Here we identified the structural components of DRB1 and DRB2 required for the miRNA-guided transcript cleavage pathway. To further characterize these proteins, we studied their evolutionary conservation among land plants. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DRB1 sequence was aligned to those of orthologs identified in public databases. The DRB1 orthologs were from a wide range of evolutionarily diverse plant species, including eudicots, monocots, and a moss. The alignment clearly showed a high degree of conservation in the N-terminal region relative to the whole sequence (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). Previously it has been shown that the severe developmental phenotype of <italic>Arabidopsis drb1</italic> plants can be complemented via the transgene-based expression of a truncated version of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DRB1 (419 aa) lacking the 249 amino acid residues of the C-terminal domain (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). This is in accordance with our amino acid alignment because of the lack of C-terminal conservation, suggesting that the DRB1 C-terminus may not be required in all plant species. A lack of sequence conservation is also evident in region 2 of the second dsRBD of DRB1, dsRBD2. In canonical dsRNA binding domains, region 2 is characterized by a GPxH motif (where x is any residue), which is crucial for recognition of, and binding to, molecules of dsRNA (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gleghorn and Maquat, 2014</xref>). The dsRBD2 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DRB1 has been shown to be a weak, non-canonically structured binding domain that primarily mediates protein&#x02013;protein interaction, and not dsRNA recognition or binding (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The lack of sequence conservation within region 2 may therefore account for the function of dsRBD2 in DRB1 in the miRNA pathway among land plants. The sequence conservation of DRB2 orthologs in land plants revealed two surprising findings: i) both DRB2 dsRBDs have very high sequence conservation, and ii) compared to the C-terminal region of plant DRB1 orthologs, the C-terminal region is markedly conserved (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results suggest that DRB1 dsRBD2 has a conserved low affinity for dsRNA and that DRB2 has been more conserved in evolution than DRB1.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p><bold>Evolutionary conservation of DRB1.</bold>

This <italic>in silico</italic> analysis showed that dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 of DRB2, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5 appear to adopt the canonical structure of DRB1 dsRBD1 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>). The domain superimposition also revealed that region 2, the loop between &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2, was only re-oriented in DRB1 dsRBD2. This structural alteration to dsRBD2 has been previously suggested to reduce the dsRNA binding affinity of DRB1 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). We then analyzed the amino acid sequence of DRB1 and DRB2 in more detail to gain insights into the secondary structures of these proteins. Although both DRB proteins are required in the miRNA pathway, their amino acid sequences are strikingly different, suggesting that they display different surfaces for protein&#x02013;RNA and protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><bold>dsRNA binding domains of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DRB proteins.</bold>

Region 3 of DRB1 dsRBD2 and DRB2 dsRBD2 is also tightly conserved, but is dissimilar in their first dsRNA binding domain. Region 2, in contrast, has the conserved GPxH motif in the dsRBD1 domains of both DRB proteins, but was only present in the dsRBD2 of DRB2. This region aids dsRNA binding to the major groove via the histidine (H) residue of the GPxH motif, which is absent only in DRB1 dsRBD2 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, when this residue was mutated in DRB1 dsRBD1, a dsRBD with high affinity to its dsRNA substrate, only a slight decrease in dsRNA binding affinity was observed (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these analyses provide evidence that DRB1 and DRB2 differ substantially at the amino acid and secondary structure levels.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although our knowledge of the biogenesis of plant miRNAs has improved dramatically in recent years, several of the latest findings indicate that some important mechanisms remain poorly understood. The biogenesis of miRNA/miRNA<sup>&#x02217;</sup> from miRNA-containing intermediates occurs in dicing bodies (D-bodies), and a growing number of genes, in addition to well characterized core components (e.g., DCL1, SE, and DRB1), have been shown to be required in this process (reviewed by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Rogers and Chen, 2013</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the D-bodies are dynamic and may vary in protein composition according to developmental stage, environmental conditions and even precursor transcript structure. Although DRB1 is a well-characterized DCL1 partnering protein, our results reveal that DRB2 has been much more conserved during plant evolution. In addition, DRB1 and DRB2 have similar but functionally different domains, such as their dsRBD2 and C-terminus. The results presented here, together with our previous report (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Reis et al., 2015</xref>), suggest that DRB1 and DRB2 act as bridging proteins in the assembly of different component proteins, and even different RNAs, into the core of the D-bodies, thus altering the properties of the D-bodies and the functionality of the miRNA pathway as a whole (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothetical model for the role of DRB1 and DRB2 domains.</bold> miRNAs are encoded as gene-like structures and are recognized by a dicer (DCL1) and a DRB protein. DRB1 dsRBD1 recognizes dsRNAs and its dsRBD2 promotes dimerization and interaction with other proteins, without the aid of its C-terminus (shown as a dotted line). DRB2 dsRBD1 also recognizes dsRNAs and its dsRBD2 appears to mediate different protein&#x02013;protein interactions to those of DRB1, possibly assembling dicing bodies (D-bodies) different to those containing DRB1. This may also require the presence of the DRB2 C-terminus (shown as a continuous line).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-06-01201-g007"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Australian Research Council (grant numbers DP130103697 and FF0776510) and contributions from the University of Sydney, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Queensland University of Technology, and Australian Postgraduate Award scheme.</p></ack><sec sec-type="supplementary material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2015.01201">http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2015.01201</ext-link></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Table_1.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Altschul</surname><given-names>S.
