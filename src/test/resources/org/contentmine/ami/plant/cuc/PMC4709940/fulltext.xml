Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the enrichment of down-regulated GOs was 2.87-fold higher than that of up-regulated GOs at stage 1, suggesting that IBA significantly down-regulated gene expression at 6&#x000a0;h. The GO functional category indicated that IBA significantly up- or down-regulated processes associated with auxin signaling, ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, photosynthesis, oxidoreductase activity and extracellular region, secondary cell wall biogenesis, and the cell wall during the development process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment indicated that ribosome biogenesis, plant hormone signal transduction, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, ribosome, cutin, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism were the pathways most highly regulated by IBA.

This is part of the normal development of a plant and occurs naturally or can also be induced by stresses such as wounding, flooding, and etiolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Under environmental stress, adventitious rooting acts as an alternative or supplement to seed propagation and is an important mechanism in response to stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This method of vegetative propagation in plants has been widely used for the commercial production of woody forest and horticultural species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The formation of adventitious roots has been associated with important aspects of tissue dedifferentiation and can be induced reproducibly under the control of exogenous phytohormones. Auxin acts as an effective inducer of adventitious roots in many plants and may interact with other endogenous factors or environmental stimuli during this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Horticultural and agricultural practices have demonstrated that the external application of auxin exerts a great effect in inducing adventitious rooting in many plant species. Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is used worldwide as a rooting hormone due to its higher stability and efficiency versus indole 3-acetic acid (IAA). In cells, IBA converts into IAA and acts as a slow release source of IAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Auxin can induce ethylene production via the up-regulation of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase 4 (<italic>ACS4</italic>) gene, which was found to be an early auxin-induced gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], to further promote adventitious rooting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although auxin plays a crucial role in inducing cell dedifferentiation and root primordium formation, the exact mechanism of its action is still poorly understood.</p><p>The physiological and biochemical changes that occur during the complex process of <italic>in vitro</italic> root development have been extensively investigated in last few decades. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process must be further explored. In recent years, various molecular and genetic approaches have been used to identify the genes involved in regulating adventitious root development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plants. Among the genes identified, several gene families in the auxin signaling pathway have been shown to mediate adventitious rooting in many plants, such as the members of the auxin-inducible <italic>ARF</italic> (<italic>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR</italic>) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], members of the auxin-inducible <italic>GH3</italic> (<italic>GRETCHEN HAGEN 3</italic>) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the tryptophan-dependent IAA biosynthesis gene <italic>YUCCA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the auxin efflux carrier genes <italic>PIN</italic> (<italic>PIN-FORMED</italic>) and <italic>ABCB/PGP</italic> (<italic>ATP BINDING CASSETTE-TYPE B/ P-GLYCOPROTEINs</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the auxin influx carrier gene <italic>AUX1/LAX</italic> (<italic>AUXIN/IAA</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the auxin-responsive LOB-domain (<italic>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN</italic>) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. LOB-domain transcription factors encoded by several phylogenetically, closely related genes, such as the rice genes <italic>ARL1</italic> (<italic>ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and <italic>CRL1</italic> (<italic>CROWN ROOTLESS1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the maize gene <italic>RTCS</italic> (<italic>ROOTLESS CONCERNING CROWN AND SEMINAL ROOTS</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the <italic>Medicago</italic> gene <italic>MtLOB29</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes <italic>LBD16</italic> (<italic>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN</italic>) and <italic>LBD29</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], have been identified and shown to mediate adventitious rooting. Moreover, the <italic>SCARECROW</italic>-like genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the cytokinin type B response regulator (<italic>PtRR13</italic>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and the <italic>APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR</italic> (<italic>AP2/ERF</italic>) transcription factor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] have also been demonstrated to be involved in modulating adventitious rooting. Using cDNA microarrays, Brinker et al. (2004) identified 220 genes that were significantly changed during root development in hypocotyl cuttings of <italic>Pinus contorta</italic> under IBA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Holmes et al. (2010) identified 904 and 993 up- and down-regulated probe sets in root-forming cultures of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> as well as significant changes in metabolism, signaling and the expression of transcription factors linked to <italic>in vitro</italic> adventitious root formation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Despite this, the gene expression profile during adventitious rooting in response to auxin remains uncharacterized.</p><p>Recently, RNA-Seq has been used to explore transcriptomic data and study gene expression at the whole genome level in model and non-model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. <italic>De novo</italic> short read assembly technology has been successfully applied to identify gene expression profiles and discover new genes without a reference genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This technology platform enables the precise elucidation of transcripts present within a particular sample and can be used to calculate gene expression based on absolute transcript abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This technology has also been used to investigate the gene expression profile during adventitious rooting. Wei et al. (2014) reported 1091 differentially expressed unigenes, including 656 up- and 435 down-regulated genes, in tea cuttings (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) treated with IBA. The genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, secondary metabolism, cell wall organization, and glutathione metabolism potentially contribute to adventitious rooting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Mung bean is one of the most important tropical grain legumes that serves as a significant and a cheap source of carbohydrates and easily digestible protein for the people of Asia and Africa but is also increasingly extending into Australia, USA, Canada and Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, this plant has been widely used as a model plant species to study physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms involved in the process of adventitious root formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This provides an ideal experimental system with which to study the entire process of root formation, including the pre-morphogenesis stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our previous studies, we had demonstrated that IBA has a great effect on promoting adventitious rooting in mung bean seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Recently, we had characterized the mung bean transcriptome and the differentially expressed gene profile and metabolic pathways during early stage (the induction and initiation stages) of adventitious root development in the hypocotyl cuttings without auxin treatment using RNA-Seq technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the present study, RNA-Seq technology was exploited to highlight global changes in gene expression in response to IBA during the induction (6&#x000a0;h) and initiation (24&#x000a0;h) stages of root development in mung bean hypocotyl cuttings. We aimed to perform gene profiling, characterize the metabolic pathways specifically regulated by IBA and further to uncover the molecular basis of IBA promoting adventitious rooting. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to validate several of the transcriptional changes observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Illumina Solexa RNA paired-end sequencing and mapped reads</title><p>To provide a comprehensive overview of mung bean and adventitious rooting in the seedlings at a transcriptional level, five cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced from the hypocotyl tissues of 5&#x000a0;day-old seedlings harvested separately at 0&#x000a0;h (Con), after primary root excision and incubation in water for 6&#x000a0;h (Wat6) or 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M IBA for 6&#x000a0;h (IBA6), and after primary root excision and incubation in water for 24&#x000a0;h (Wat24) or IBA for 24&#x000a0;h (IBA24) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), of which, the Con, Wat6, and Wat24 were previously sequenced in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The Chrysalis cluster module of TRINITY was used to cluster the transcripts and generated a total of 78,697 unigenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Furthermore, the percentage of DEGs clustered into the categories of rhythmic process in biological process, extracellular region and extracellular region part in cellular component, and antioxidant activity, electron carrier activity, enzyme regulator activity, and nutrient reservoir activity in molecular function were strongly increased from stage 1 to stage 2. In the group of down-regulated GO terms, nearly equal percentages of DEGs in most of the subcategories were examined between stage 1 and stage 2, with the exception of cell killing in biological process, extracellular matrix, extracellular region, and extracellular region part in cellular component, nutrient reservoir activity, and structural molecule activity in molecular function. In the subcategories of cell killing, extracellular matrix, extracellular region, and extracellular region part, the DEGs ratio at stage 1 was higher than that at stage 2, whereas for nutrient reservoir activity and structural molecule activity, the DEGs ratio at stage 1 was lower than that at stage 2. These results suggest that profound changes in biological function caused by IBA occurred in GO subcategories such as extracellular region, extracellular matrix, extracellular region part, antioxidant activity, electron carrier activity, cell killing, and structural molecule activity during early stages of IBA-induced rooting.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>GO enrichment for up-regulated unigenes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2372_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>GO enrichment for down-regulated unigenes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2372_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> list the top 50 significantly up- and down-regulated GO categories during the IBA-induced development process. The results revealed that the GOs associated with auxin signaling, such as auxin mediated signaling pathway, cellular response to auxin stimulus, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, response to auxin stimulus, cellular response to hormone stimulus, and hormone-mediated signaling pathway, were significantly up-regulated both at stage 1 and stage 2. The GOs associated with ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, such as nucleolus, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, rRNA processing, ribosome, structural constituent of ribosome, ribosomal subunit, cytosolic ribosome, and translation, were significantly up-regulated at stage 1 but significantly down-regulated at stage 2. The GOs associated with photosynthesis, such as photosystem, photosynthesis, photosystem II, and photosystem I, were significantly down-regulated at stage 1. The GOs for oxidoreductase activity and extracellular region were significantly down-regulated both at stage 1 and stage 2. The GO secondary cell wall biogenesis was down-regulated at stage 1, while the GO cell wall was up-regulated at stage 2. The GOs associated with photosynthesis, such as light reaction, photosystem, photosystem II, and thylakoid, as well as cell wall, external encapsulating structure, and hydrolase activity (hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds), were significantly up-regulated from stage 1 to stage 2. However, the GOs associated with hormone pathway and signaling such as response to chemical stimulus, response to hormone stimulus, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, response to organic substance, cellular response to hormone stimulus, response to auxin stimulus, cellular response to endogenous stimulus, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity, and sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity, were significantly down-regulated from stage 1 to stage 2.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Top-5 significantly up- and down-regulated GOs between the samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>GO ID</th><th>Total genes</th><th>DEGs</th><th>FDR</th><th>Level</th><th>Terms</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">IBA6:Wat6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Down-regulated</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005576</td><td>1222</td><td>232</td><td>5.87E-38</td><td>2</td><td>extracellular region</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0016491</td><td>1856</td><td>291</td><td>1.34E-32</td><td>3</td><td>oxidoreductase activity</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009521</td><td>79</td><td>49</td><td>3.74E-32</td><td>3</td><td>photosystem</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0015979</td><td>192</td><td>72</td><td>3.66E-29</td><td>4</td><td>photosynthesis</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0046906</td><td>485</td><td>119</td><td>7.40E-29</td><td>4</td><td>tetrapyrrole binding</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Up-regulated</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005730</td><td>378</td><td>103</td><td>1.06E-24</td><td>5</td><td>nucleolus</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0022613</td><td>200</td><td>70</td><td>2.29E-23</td><td>4</td><td>ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0042254</td><td>186</td><td>67</td><td>2.73E-23</td><td>5</td><td>ribosome biogenesis</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009734</td><td>238</td><td>72</td><td>4.81E-20</td><td>6</td><td>auxin mediated signaling pathway</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0071365</td><td>247</td><td>72</td><td>4.35E-19</td><td>6</td><td>cellular response to auxin stimulus</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">IBA24:Wat24</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Down-regulated</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005840</td><td>538</td><td>161</td><td>2.51E-42</td><td>4</td><td>ribosome</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0003735</td><td>471</td><td>147</td><td>4.33E-41</td><td>3</td><td>structural constituent of ribosome</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005198</td><td>606</td><td>161</td><td>1.42E-35</td><td>2</td><td>structural molecule activity</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0006412</td><td>671</td><td>157</td><td>8.65E-28</td><td>6</td><td>translation</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0030529</td><td>801</td><td>165</td><td>9.85E-23</td><td>3</td><td>ribonucleoprotein complex</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Up-regulated</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009734</td><td>238</td><td>54</td><td>6.20E-17</td><td>6</td><td>auxin mediated signaling pathway</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0071365</td><td>247</td><td>55</td><td>6.20E-17</td><td>6</td><td>cellular response to auxin stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009733</td><td>367</td><td>68</td><td>7.03E-17</td><td>5</td><td>response to auxin stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005618</td><td>654</td><td>87</td><td>1.06E-12</td><td>4</td><td>cell wall</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0030312</td><td>671</td><td>87</td><td>3.91E-12</td><td>3</td><td>external encapsulating structure</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">IBA24:IBA6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Down-regualted</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0042221</td><td>2287</td><td>297</td><td>6.01E-21</td><td>3</td><td>response to chemical stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009719</td><td>1364</td><td>204</td><td>1.28E-20</td><td>3</td><td>response to endogenous stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009725</td><td>1235</td><td>182</td><td>1.63E-17</td><td>4</td><td>response to hormone stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0009755</td><td>768</td><td>130</td><td>5.55E-17</td><td>5</td><td>hormone-mediated signaling pathway</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0010033</td><td>1584</td><td>215</td><td>5.55E-17</td><td>4</td><td>response to organic substance</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Up-regulated</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005576</td><td>1222</td><td>267</td><td>5.64E-39</td><td>2</td><td>extracellular region</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0015979</td><td>192</td><td>65</td><td>6.90E-18</td><td>4</td><td>photosynthesis</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0005618</td><td>654</td><td>133</td><td>2.56E-15</td><td>4</td><td>cell wall</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0030312</td><td>671</td><td>134</td><td>7.04E-15</td><td>3</td><td>external encapsulating structure</td></tr><tr><td>GO:0019684</td><td>82</td><td>34</td><td>7.93E-12</td><td>5</td><td>photosynthesis, light reaction</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>KEGG pathway enrichment analysis</title><p>To further determine which biological pathways were significantly (FDR&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) modulated during the process, KEGG pathway enrichment was performed using the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This analysis revealed that 12 and five pathways were enriched at stage 1 and stage 2, respectively. Among these, five KOs were significantly down-regulated and two KOs were significantly up-regulated at stage 1, suggesting that significant metabolic changes occur at the 6-h time point (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Further analysis indicated that the pathways of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes and plant hormone signal transduction were up-regulated both at stage 1 and stage 2, and the pathway of pentose and glucuronate interconversions, which has a function in glucuronate and pectin degradation, was up-regulated at stage 2. The significantly down-regulated KOs at stage 1 included photosynthesis, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, while those at stage 2 were ribosome, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cutin, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism. When compared with stage 1, photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, cell cycle, and ribosome were up-regulated, while plant hormone signal transduction, diterpenoid biosynthesis, aminobenzoate degradation, bisphenol degradation, glucosinolate biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism were down-regulated from stage 1 to stage 2. The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway is required for suberin and lignin biosynthesis. The cutin pathway is involved in suberin and wax biosynthesis. Flavonoids are a major class of plant secondary metabolites that serve multitude of functions, including as pigments and in antioxidant activity. The pathways of aminobenzoate degradation and bisphenol degradation have functions in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. These results indicate that the plant hormone signal transduction and ribosome biogenesis pathways were significantly up-regulated by IBA treatment, photosynthesis activity was down-regulated at stage 1 but up-regulated at stage 2, and plant hormone signal transduction was down-regulated from stage 1 to stage 2. Furthermore, the pectin degradation pathway was up-regulated and suberin, lignin and wax biosynthesis were down-regulated at both stage 1 and stage 2, suggesting the beginning of cell wall loosening from stage 1 to stage 2. The secondary metabolism pathways, such as phenylpropanoids and associated flavonoids, might play important roles in IBA-induced adventitious rooting. Phenylpropanoids function in plant defense as inducible chemical barriers or as signaling molecules. The core phenylpropanoid pathway is organized from phenylalanine to an activated (hydroxy) cinnamic acid derivative, and the specific branch pathways lead to the formation of lignin, sinapate esters, condensed tannins, anthocyanins, coumarins, benzoic acids and flavonoids/isoflavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

During stage 2, 11 genes including five <italic>GH3</italic> genes, four auxin-induced protein genes, an auxin-responsive protein IAA12-like gene, and an auxin-binding protein ABP19a-like gene were up-regulated; the hydrolase activity gene was down-regulated. When compared with stage 1, the gene encoding for auxin-binding protein ABP19a-like (RPKM =52.8) was specifically up-regulated at stage 2. Sixteen auxin-induced protein genes were down-regulated. The <italic>GH3</italic> gene family encodes IAA-amido synthetases that negatively regulate the levels of free IAA by conjugating IAA to amino acids. IAA-amino acid hydrolase hydrolyzes the amide bond between IAA and the conjugated amino acid to release active IAA. IAA-amino acid hydrolase coordinates with PIN and GH3s to maintain auxin homeostasis in the adventitious roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The IBA-induced overexpression of the <italic>GH3</italic> genes and the IBA-mediated repression of the IAA-amino acid hydrolase gene both in stage 1 and stage 2 suggest a reduction of free auxin and an increase in amino-IAA during the early stages of adventitious rooting.

The specifically up-regulated ABP19a-like gene indicates that the mediation of ABP in rapid auxin signaling occurred in stage 2.

A total of 143 unigenes (fold change&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2), including 92 auxin-related genes, 37 ethylene-related genes, five cytokinin-related genes, and eight gibberellin genes, were identified (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p><p>In the group of auxin-related genes, a total of 60 genes, with 52 up-regulated 2.2- to 88-fold and eight down-regulated 3- to 8-fold, and a total of 41 genes, with 33 up-regulated 2- to 37-fold and seven down-regulated 2- to 11-fold, were identified at stage 1 and stage 2, respectively. The down-regulated genes at stage 1 included an ABC transporter, two Aux5NG4-like, a PIN4b (auxin efflux carrier), and four IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like genes; at stage 2, the genes included six Aux5NG4-like genes and an auxin response factor 9-like gene. Compared with stage 1, a total of 38 genes, including 11 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated, were detected at stage 2. The up-regulated genes were primarily members of the ABC transporter G family, while down-regulated genes were mostly members of the AUX family. Auxin efflux carriers control auxin distribution to establish and maintain auxin concentration gradients in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], triggering the establishment of new growth axes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].

Compared with stage 1, there were a total of 20 genes, with 9 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated genes, at stage 2. Genes coding for an ACS and an ethylene receptor were up-regulated both at stage 1 and stage 2; however, genes coding for an ACC oxidase, an ACS, and three AP2/ERFs were down-regulated from stage 1 to stage 2.

GA20ox is a key oxidase enzyme in the biosynthesis of GA that catalyzes the conversion of GA12 and GA53 to GA9 and GA20 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

These genes were selected for validation of the transcriptomic data using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Detailed information on these genes is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>. Based on the RNA-Seq results and the study published by Jian et al.

The qRT-PCR results showed that <italic>CPY20</italic> was the most stable housekeeping gene, so it was used to calculate the relative expression levels in this study. The expression levels of all the genes measured by qRT-PCR showed a strong correlation to the RNA-Seq data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

During two time points for adventitious rooting, the expression levels of seven <italic>ARF</italic> family genes exhibited significantly decreasing trends both in the water and IBA treatments, but they were significantly up-regulated by IBA, with the exception of <italic>ARF3</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic>, compared with the controls.

The <italic>LBD29</italic> and <italic>LBD41</italic> genes were significantly up-regulated by IBA at two time points. The two genes <italic>MYB134</italic> and <italic>MYB114</italic> exhibited sharp decreases at two time points and a slight increase at 24&#x000a0;h compared with 6&#x000a0;h, but their expression levels were up-regulated by IBA at 6&#x000a0;h. The four <italic>NAC</italic> family genes were significantly up-regulated by IBA at 6&#x000a0;h compared with the controls. The genes <italic>AHK2</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> histidine kinase) and <italic>AHK3</italic> were significantly up-regulated by IBA at two time points.

The gene quinone oxidoreductase-like protein (<italic>QORL</italic>) was strongly up-regulated by IBA at 6&#x000a0;h. The ARF transcription factors mediate auxin signaling at the transcriptional level by regulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. The <italic>LBD</italic> genes contain at least one auxin-responsive element (AuxRE) and are involved in auxin-mediating development processes.

Moreover, NAC genes are also involved in responses to stress, such as drought and high salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. AHK1, AHK2, and AHK3 have been identified as cytokinin receptors and are involved in the water stress response during the early vegetative stages of plant growth and regulation of meristem development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants lacking AHK2, AHK3, and AHK4 exhibit enhanced adventitious root growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].

Interestingly, DEG analysis revealed the most significantly and abundantly expressed genes in response to IBA, including genes associated with auxin homeostasis and signaling, ethylene pathway, cytokinin pathway, transcription factors, cell wall modification, cell redox homeostasis and the stress response, secondary metabolites and flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism and protein transport and degradation, lipid and sugar metabolic process, photosynthesis, signal transduction, and the cell cycle. Furthermore, a total of 143 DEGs specifically involved in plant hormone signaling and a total of 345 TF genes also responded to IBA.

The number of clean reads mapped to each unigene was calculated and then normalized to RPKM (reads per kb per million reads) using ERANGE3.1 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Unigene expression levels were analyzed using the DEGseq R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] with the MARS (MA-plot-based method with Random Sampling) model. The DEGs between each pair of samples were screened using the Audic-Claverie algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>] with an FDR threshold of &#x02264;0.001 and an absolute value of log2&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1. Multiple test corrections for the p-value and FDR were performed with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. To gain insight into the differential expression of genes specifically induced by IBA at each time point, the analyses were performed between IBA6 and Wat6 and between IBA24 and Wat24, as well as IBA24 relative to IBA6, and were represented as stage 1, stage 2, and stage 1 to stage 2, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Functional annotation and classification</title><p>All resulting unigenes were annotated according to their sequence similarity to previously annotated genes. First, the unigenes were aligned to the public protein databases NR, SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, Pfam, and CDD using BLASTx with similarity set at &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;% and an E-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1e-5. The KOG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups for eukaryotic complete genomes) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway annotations were performed by sequence comparisons against the two databases using BLASTALL and KAAS software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.18/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.18/</ext-link>) with an E-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1e-5. The resulting blast hits were processed using Blast2GO software (version 2.3.5, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blast2go.de/">http://www.blast2go.de/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with an E-value threshold of 1e-5 to retrieve associated GO terms. WEGO software was used for achievement of GO classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The results that presented the best alignment were used to identify the sequence direction and to predict the coding regions using BLASTx searches against protein databases, with the priority order of NR, SWISS-PROT, KEGG and KOG if conflicting results were obtained. The ESTScan software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] was used to analyze the unigenes that did not align to any of the above databases. KEGG mapping was used to determine the metabolic pathways. KEGG pathways were retrieved from the KEGG web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. To further enrich the pathway annotations, unigenes were submitted to the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and the single-directional best-hit information method was selected. To identify the enriched pathways, the phyper test was used to measure the relative coverage of the annotated KEGG orthologous groups of a pathway against the transcriptome background, and the pathways with a p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 were classified as enriched.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Quantitative reverse transcription PCR validation</title><p>To validate the RNA-Seq data, we selected 36 genes that were shown to be involved in adventitious root development for q-PCR analysis. PCR samples were harvested from the hypocotyls of three biological replicates under the same conditions as the samples subjected to Illumina sequencing. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified on RNeasy mini spin columns (Qiagen) with on-column DNase I treatment according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. RNA integrity was examined with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using an AMV First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The gene-specific primer pairs were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the confirmed sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Real-time PCR was run using a LightCycler 480 II (Roche Applied Science) and ABI SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (ABI, Foster, USA). Reactions were subjected to the following conditions: 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;min followed by 40&#x000a0;cycles of 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;s and 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 40&#x000a0;s. A melting curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the primer specificity for each primer set to verify the presence of a single melting peak after amplification. &#x02018;No cDNA&#x02019; samples (water) and &#x02018;no RT&#x02019; samples were included as negative controls. All reactions were performed with three independent biological replicates, and the expression levels calculated for each sample were based on three technical replicates. Output data were generated with Sequence Detector version 1.3.1 software (ABI). The relative expression levels of the selected genes were calculated in relation to the reference gene using the comparative threshold cycle method with the delta-delta Ct method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Statistical analyses were conducted with Student&#x02019;s t-tests at the <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 level of significance. The expression levels of all the genes measured by qRT-PCR showed a strong correlation to the RNA-Seq data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The unigene sequence information of this article is available in the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR1653637">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR1653637</ext-link>) at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the sequence read archive SRR 1653637 and the accession numbers GBXO01000001-GBXO01078617.
