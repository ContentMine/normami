By probing with their stylets, they interact with the plant, they vector viruses and when they reach the phloem they start a continuous ingestion. Many plant resistances to aphids have been identified, several have been deployed. However, some resistances breaking down have been observed. In the melon, a gene that confers resistance to aphids has been deployed in some melon-producing areas, and aphid colony development on <italic>Vat</italic>-carrying plants has been observed in certain agrosystems. The <italic>Vat</italic> gene is a NBS-LRR gene that confers resistance to the aphid species <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> and exhibits the unusual characteristic of also conferring resistance to non-persistently transmitted viruses when they are inoculated by the aphid. Thus, we characterized patterns of resistance to aphid and virus using the aphid diversity and we investigated the mechanisms by which aphids and viruses may adapt to the <italic>Vat</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a <italic>Vat</italic>-transgenic line built in a susceptible background, we described the <italic>Vat</italic>- spectrum of resistance to aphids, and resistance to viruses triggered by aphids using a set of six <italic>A. gossypii</italic> biotypes. Discrepancies between both resistance phenotypes revealed that aphid adaptation to <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance does not occur only via avirulence factor alterations but also via adaptation to elicited defenses. In experiments conducted with three virus species serially inoculated by aphids from and to <italic>Vat</italic> plants, the viruses did not evolve to circumvent <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance.</p><p>We confirmed discrepancies between both resistance phenotypes by testing each aphid biotype with a set of thirteen melon accessions chosen to reflect the natural diversity of the melon. Inheritance studies revealed that patterns of resistance to virus triggered by aphids are controlled by different alleles at the <italic>Vat</italic> locus and at least another locus located at a short genetic distance. Therefore, resistance to viruses triggered by aphids is controlled by a gene cluster.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Under the Flor model, changes in the avirulence gene determine the ability of the pathogen to overcome the resistance conferred by a plant gene. The <italic>Vat</italic> gene belongs to a resistance gene family that fits this pest/pathogen&#x02013;plant interaction, and we revealed an additional mechanism of aphid adaptation that potentially exists in other interactions between plants and pests or pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-016-0708-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Aphis gossypii</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Cucumis melo</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Vat</italic></kwd><kwd>Durable resistance</kwd><kwd>Biotype</kwd><kwd>Allele</kwd><kwd>Melon</kwd><kwd>Transgenic melon</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ANR</institution></funding-source><award-id>ANR- 2010-STRA-001-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boissot</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>French Ministry of Agriculture</institution></funding-source><award-id>C06/02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boissot</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Among the 4000 known aphid species worldwide, approximately one hundred have exploited the agricultural environment, and their ability to rapidly colonize crops makes aphids serious pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Once an aphid settles on crops, it simultaneously feeds and reproduces. An aphid pushes its stylets through layers of plant tissue to reach the phloem. The path from the epidermis to the phloem is intercellular, and an aphid salivates while moving along this path, developing a protective sheath against plant defense. When its stylets are tightly inserted in the phloem, an aphid begins removing photoassimilates by continuous fluid ingestion that causes direct damage to the plant. On crops, aphid reproduction is mainly parthenogenetic with telescoping generations what leads to multiple generations on a crop in a single season. Aphid proliferation on plants can cause stunting, severe leaf curling and plant death. Moreover, short probing punctures in cells along the path to the phloem allow the acquisition/transmission of non-persistent viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. When the stylets reach the phloem, the acquisition/transmission of persistent viruses can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The management of aphids infesting crops is clearly challenging. Pesticide sprays are predominantly used to combat aphids. Since the 1980s, many species have developed resistance to insecticides, particularly two cosmopolitan and polyphagous aphids, <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Sulz) and <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> (Glover) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Screening germplasms for plant resistance led to the discovery of accessions in several crop species that displayed resistance to various aphid species. However, the sources of plant resistance to aphids are limited and rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the relatively high number of resistant accessions discovered in certain species should not mask the fact that resistance to aphid typically arises from a small number of genes with only a few resistance alleles. In practice, plant genes that confer resistance to aphids have been primarily introduced into cultivated varieties of cereals, fruit trees and vegetables, and some resistant varieties have been deployed on a large scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Evidence from biotypes (<italic>i.e.</italic> clones able to survive, reproduce on and/or cause injury to a cultivated plant that is resistant to other clones of the same species) indicates that some aphid species can adapt to plant resistance genes. The gene <italic>Ag1</italic>, which confers resistance to <italic>Amphorophora agathonica</italic>, was extensively used in raspberry for fifty years before a resistance-breaking biotype appeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Resistance to <italic>Nasonovia ribisnigri</italic> is conferred by the <italic>Nr</italic> gene in lettuce, and breakdown of this resistance occurred 10&#x000a0;years after the gene&#x02019;s wide deployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Russian wheat aphid <italic>Diuraphis noxia</italic> overcame the resistance gene <italic>Dn4</italic> less than 10&#x000a0;years after the gene had been released in wheat cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adapted biotypes of <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic>, were observed prior to the deployment of some resistances in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our objective was to investigate aphid adaptation to plant resistance in a system in which plant resistance and aphid diversity have been well characterized: <italic>Cucumis melo</italic> and <italic>A. gossypii</italic>.</p><p><italic>Cucumis melo</italic>, originating from Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], is one of the main species within the <italic>Cucurbitaceae</italic> family. <italic>C. melo</italic> is found throughout the world, exhibiting considerable genetic diversity in cultivated and wild genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Melon crops are only colonized by <italic>A. gossypii</italic>, a cosmopolitan aphid. To date, fewer than twenty multilocus genotypes (MLGs), as revealed by 8 SSR markers, have been observed developing colonies on melon plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Resistant melon accessions have been largely described since the 1970s; they originated from East and Far East Asia, Europe, Africa, America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Early open-field studies revealed that melon resistance to the US Southeastern biotype of aphids was ineffective against the Southwestern biotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and <italic>vice versa</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the same manner, low resistance levels to <italic>A. gossypii</italic> from Spain were observed in laboratory biotests in melon accessions that exhibited a high level of resistance to French <italic>A. gossypii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore adapted clones of <italic>A. gossypii</italic> were already observed, prior to the deployment of resistance in melon crops in some regions. Recently, Thomas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>A. gossypii</italic> biotypes can be related to MLGs. Clones sharing the same MLG exhibit a similar acceptance on a set of melon accessions (low acceptance as plant resistance phenotype). Nevertheless, the fitness of the clones sharing the same MLG exhibited some variation. <italic>A. gossypii</italic> is an efficient vector of viruses transmitted in a non-persistent manner such as <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV), <italic>Zucchini yellow mosaic virus</italic> (ZYMV), <italic>Watermelon mosaic virus</italic> (WMV) and <italic>Papaya ringspot virus</italic> (PRSV) and an efficient vector of the <italic>Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus</italic> (CABYV) transmitted in a persistent manner.</p><p>In 1987, a melon cultivar in the French catalog, Margot, was declared resistant to aphids for the first time. This resistance has been characterized using two <italic>A. gossypii</italic> clones, NM1 and C9. It is controlled by a major gene, <italic>Vat</italic>, and several quantitative trait loci that have been localized in the melon genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The <italic>Vat</italic> gene encodes a coiled-coil (CC)-nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The resistance genes belonging to this family are widely assumed to be involved in the specific recognition of pathogen and pest effectors and the activation of plant defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recently, the efficacy of this resistance was jeopardized in Southeastern France and was overcome in the Lesser Antilles (Thomas S, Vanlerberghe-Masutti F, Mistral P, Loiseau A, Boissot N: Insight into the durability of aphid resistance from the demo-genetic study of <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> populations in melon crops. Submitted.).</p><p>Altogether, this raises two questions: (1) How broad is the resistance conferred by the <italic>Vat</italic> gene in the face of <italic>A. gossypii</italic> diversity? (2) Are broader forms of resistance available other than <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance among genetically diverse melon? Using a set of aphid clones, we revealed a limited spectrum of <italic>Vat</italic> resistance, and we identified melon accessions exhibiting larger spectra controlled by at least another locus linked to the <italic>Vat</italic> gene.</p><p>Moreover, melon plants harboring the resistance <italic>Vat</italic> gene are susceptible to viruses when inoculated mechanically or using other aphid species as vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but these <italic>Vat</italic> plants become resistant to non-persistent viruses when inoculated by the NM1 and C9 <italic>A. gossypii</italic> biotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In other words, when transmitting non-persistent viruses, NM1 and C9 biotypes trigger resistance to these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, two additional questions are raised: (1) Do all aphid biotypes, regardless of their ability to circumvent <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance, trigger resistance to viruses? (2) Are viruses able to adapt to <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance? We showed that clone ability to colonize <italic>Vat</italic>-plants was not a predictor of a lack of ability to trigger the resistance to virus. We also showed that viruses were not able to adapt to <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patterns of resistance observed in a <italic>Vat</italic>-transgenic line and 13 melon accessions with nine <italic>A. gossypii</italic> clones (Data set in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)</title><p>We observed 125 plant-aphid-virus interactions, 13 melon lines interacting with 9 aphid clones and two transgenic lines interacting with either 6 or 2 clones.

All melon accessions were resistant to CMV when inoculated by C4, even V&#x000e9;drantais, which is typically considered a susceptible control. To check if C4 was an efficient vector of CMV we observed a set of Cucurbits inoculated by CMV using C4. Several melon lines, zucchini squash and cucumber exhibited symptoms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) proving that C4 was able to transmit CMV. Other aphid clones were able to inoculate CMV to V&#x000e9;drantais, proving their vectoring capacity. Sixty percent of the interactions (melon accession/aphid clone) exhibited a resistant plant response. Surprisingly, PI 161375, the accession used to isolate the <italic>Vat</italic> gene, did not exhibit the same pattern of resistance to CMV as the transgenic line TR3. In the same way, none lines amplifying the marker developed from the <italic>Vat</italic> gene (Z1431) did exhibit the same pattern of resistance to CMV as TR3.

This resistance is restricted to the <italic>A. gossypii</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but its efficacy against the large diversity of <italic>A. gossypii</italic> remains unknown. In addition, allelic variation at the <italic>Vat</italic> locus inducing phenotypical variation has been only hypothetical until now. Given that resistance to virus triggered by aphids was demonstrated to be qualitative, this trait can be used to describe biotypes of <italic>A. gossypii</italic> species. Accordingly to Smith (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], biotypes are revealed on a set of cultivars, each possessing a different resistance gene or gene combination that react differentially to a given biotype. Based on the plant response of 13 melon accessions to CMV inoculation by 9 aphid clones, <italic>i.e.</italic> 117 interactions, we recognized six aphid biotypes. The first biotype is represented by C6 and triggered resistance to CMV in 4 accessions. The second biotype consists of C9 and CUC1 (and putatively CUC6) and triggered resistance to CMV in 8 accessions. The third biotype, which consists of CUCU3 and putatively GWD, triggered resistance in the same set of accessions as the previous biotype, as well as Anso 77. The fourth and fifth biotypes are represented by GWD2 and NM1, respectively, and triggered resistance to CMV in 9 accessions (some common and some different). The sixth biotype is represented by C4 and triggered resistance to CMV in 13 accessions.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Are the different patterns of resistance to CMV controlled by the same locus, namely the <italic>Vat</italic> locus?</title><p>We revealed an unexpected partial pattern of resistance of the <italic>Vat</italic> gene. The <italic>Vat</italic> gene, isolated from the PI 161375 accession, was characterized using one clone, NM1-Lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent study at the agrosystem level suggested that the <italic>Vat</italic> gene confers resistance to a large number of <italic>A. gossypii</italic> clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Regarding PI 161375, eight out of the nine clones assessed triggered the resistance to CMV when used as vectors, suggesting again that a large number of <italic>A. gossypii</italic> clones triggers resistance to CMV in <italic>Vat</italic> plants. To confirm this result, we studied this trait in a <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic line. Among five clones triggering high levels of resistance to CMV in PI 161375, only three triggered a high level of resistance to CMV in the transgenic line. These data indicate that at least an additional locus is involved in resistance to CMV triggered by aphid in PI 161375.</p><p>On this basis, we proposed to rename the <italic>Vat</italic> locus <italic>Vat-1.</italic> The <italic>Vat-1</italic> allele from PI 161375 is amplified by the specific marker Z1431 and confers resistance to CMV upon inoculation by C9, GWD2, NM1, and putatively by C4. We proposed to name <italic>Vat-2</italic> the additional locus present in PI 161375. This allele confers at least resistance to CMV upon inoculation by GWD. <italic>Vat-2</italic> is likely tightly linked to <italic>Vat-1</italic> in PI 161375 because it cosegregated with <italic>Vat-1</italic>during the breeding program for constructing Margot when aphid resistance was introgressed and selected at each generation using the NM1 clone. In addition, this locus remained evident in a quasi-isogenic line, (data not shown) obtained after fifteen back-crosses and selection for resistance using the NM1 clone. This quasi-isogenic line, resistant to CMV inoculated by NM1 and GWD shares 99.99&#x000a0;% of its genome with the susceptible recurrent parent, and therefore the 0.01&#x000a0;% remaining contained <italic>Vat-1</italic> and <italic>Vat-2</italic>. V&#x000e9;drantais, which served as the susceptible control, was surprisingly resistant to CMV inoculated by C4 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and because V&#x000e9;drantais contains neither <italic>Vat-1</italic> nor <italic>Vat-2</italic> alleles detected in PI 161375, other(s) locus or allele(s) is (are) likely involved in resistance to CMV when inoculated by C4. In the same way, Smith Perfect, Canton and HSD2455 shared susceptibility to CMV when inoculated by NM1, therefore do not carry the <italic>Vat-1</italic> allele detected in PI 161375, and resistance to CMV when inoculated by C6, a resistance elicited neither by <italic>Vat-1</italic> nor by <italic>Vat-2</italic> detected in PI 161375.</p><p>A 1-Mb region that contains <italic>Vat-1</italic> exhibits the highest concentration of presence/absence gene variation polymorphisms found in the melon genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and this type of polymorphism is often related to phenotypic diversity in resistance to pathogens. This region also exhibits the highest density of resistance genes in the melon genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Twenty-three genes of the NBS-LRR family have been identified in this 1-Mb region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], that potentially corresponds to less than 20&#x000a0;cM, and these genes are candidates for <italic>Vat-2</italic>. An homolog of <italic>Vat-1</italic> in 90625 shared 93.8&#x000a0;% identity at the DNA level and 92.3&#x000a0;% at the protein level with <italic>Vat-1</italic> from PI 161375 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The numerous duplications in the region have made accurate sequencing difficult, therefore comprehensive crossing between molecular and phenotypic data is required to fully understand the genetic control of resistance to aphid and resistance to virus triggered by aphids. The use of transgenic lines will clearly help to decipher the role of each locus in this cluster.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>What have we learned from the pleiotropic resistance mediated by the <italic>Vat</italic> gene?</title><p>Recently, plant/aphid interactions have been included in the general framework of the plant immune system developed for plant/pathogen interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given that the <italic>Vat-1</italic> gene encodes an NBS-LRR protein that is similar to numerous resistance genes to pathogens, resistance is likely initiated by the specific recognition of aphid effector proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recognition activates signaling cascades; the only NBS-LRR gene-controlled cascade identified among plant resistance to aphids is the salicylic acid signaling pathway activated by <italic>Macrosiphum euphorbiae</italic> in <italic>Mi-1</italic>-tomato plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This pathway also elicits resistance to virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In <italic>Vat</italic>-melon, the cascade elicits plant defenses against aphids and viruses. Physiological responses at <italic>A. gossypii</italic> feeding sites include very early deposits of callose and lignin in the cell walls, an increased peroxidase activity, phenol synthesis and a micro-oxidative burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These physiological responses constitute a microscopic hypersensitive response in the leaf tissues of <italic>Vat</italic> plants infested by <italic>A. gossypii</italic>. Some miRNAs that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level have been shown to be up-regulated during the early stages of aphid infestation in <italic>Vat</italic>-resistant plants and down-regulated in susceptible plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Some phenotypes observed in the <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic line are consistent with the framework described above. Resistance is initiated by the specific recognition of an aphid effector that activates signaling cascades that elicit plant defenses against aphids and viruses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Phenotypes observed with the NM1 and C9 clones matched this scheme: both clones trigger resistance to CMV and were unable to fully colonize the <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic line. Considering resistance to virus triggered by aphids and low acceptance, 52 interactions among 117 studied in the natural diversity also matches this scheme. When there was no recognition of the aphid effector, plant defenses against aphids and viruses were not elicited (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The phenotypes observed with the C6 and GWD clones matched this scheme given that these clones did not mediate resistance to CMV and fully colonized the <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic line. Considering resistance to virus triggered by aphids and low acceptance, 36 interactions among 117 studied in the natural diversity also matches this scheme. No aphid effector specifically recognized by an NBS-LRR resistance protein has been described to date; however, dozens of avirulence genes have been identified in plant pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi and oomycetes. These avirulence genes seem to be subject to high-speed diversifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and this phenomenon might also be true for avirulence genes in aphids.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Model for <italic>A. gossypii</italic>/<italic>Vat</italic>-melon plant interaction: the 3 cases observed, <bold>a</bold> resistance to aphids and viruses, <bold>b</bold> susceptibility to aphids and resistance to viruses, <bold>c</bold> susceptibility to aphids and viruses, <bold>d</bold> resistance to aphids and susceptibility to viruses, which was not observed</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2016_708_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>A third group of phenotypes in the <italic>Vat</italic>-transgenic line did not fit the framework. The GWD2 clone triggered resistance to CMV, therefore the specific recognition of the GWD2 effector that activates the signaling cascades that elicit plant defenses must have occurred, but GWD2 colonized the <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic line. We hypothesized that the decoupling of resistance to aphid from resistance to virus was due to aphid adaptation, thus allowing aphids to colonize plants even when plant defenses were elicited (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The clone CUC1 partially fits this scheme. This clone fully colonized the transgenic line but appeared to occasionally mediate resistance to CMV (few plants did not exhibit symptoms). CUC1 might produce a low quantity of its avirulence effector, and the cells (and therefore the plant) receiving the virus particles without the effector allowed the virus to spread systemically. However, plants with all cells receiving both virus particles and the effector did not permit viral multiplication.</p><p>In the natural diversity, the phenotype &#x02018;resistance to virus triggered by aphids&#x02019;/&#x02018;susceptibility to aphids&#x02019; was frequent. Of the 74 cases of resistance to CMV triggered by aphid clones, we observed 26 cases with acceptance scores &#x02265;5 and still more cases, 47, with colonization scores &#x02265;6. The C6, CUC6, and C4 clones colonized all melon accessions in which they triggered resistance to CMV. The CUC1 and GWD2 clones colonized all melon accessions but one in which they triggered resistance to CMV. &#x02018;Colonization&#x02019; that results from acceptance, daily fecundity, pre-reproductive period and clone mortality exhibits quantitative variation among clones sharing the same MLG and is hypothesized to be controlled by several aphid genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Adaptation to plant resistance could result from polymorphisms and/or regulation of these genes. Comparative analyses of aphids feeding on <italic>Vat</italic> and non-<italic>Vat</italic> plants has revealed that miRNAs are differentially regulated during resistant and susceptible interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The abundance of Piwi-interacting RNA-like sequences (originating from repeat elements in the genome) in aphids feeding on <italic>Vat</italic> plants raises questions about their involvement in aphid responses to <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance. In the Russian wheat aphid (<italic>D. noxia</italic>), differences in the DNA methylation level of four genes that presumably encode proteins and enzymes in aphid salivary glands, in addition to high levels of polymorphisms, were noted between two clones exhibiting different virulences on host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Are viruses able to adapt to <italic>Vat</italic> resistance triggered by aphids?</title><p>A fourth putative scheme might occur (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> virus adaptation to defenses triggered by <italic>A. gossypii</italic> probing on <italic>Vat</italic> plants. The expected phenotype is &#x02018;susceptibility to virus when inoculated by an aphid clone incapable of colonizing <italic>Vat</italic> plants&#x02019;. This double phenotype was never observed in the transgenic line, suggesting viral adaptation did not occur. Nevertheless, this double phenotype was observed twice in natural melons; both instances involved Anso 77 and the clones C9 and CUC1. Does this mean that both clones triggered resistance in Anso but that the CMV-I17F isolate had adapted to this resistance? This is an unlikely explanation given that Anso 77 was highly resistant to CMV when resistance was triggered by NM1, C4, GWD2, GWD, or CUCU3. Resistance to colonization of Anso 77 by C9 and CUC1 was most likely conferred by gene(s) other than the <italic>Vat</italic> gene; this other gene exclusively acts against aphids, similar to all other resistance genes described in crops. The inability of viruses to adapt to defenses triggered by the puncturing of <italic>Vat</italic> plants by <italic>A. gossypii</italic> was confirmed by experimental evolution biotests wherein CMV, as well as ZYMV, failed to evolve when facing plant defenses triggered by aphid probing. Therefore, regarding the virus, <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance to viruses appeared durable in contrast to several NBS-LRR resistance to virus, such as <italic>Tm-2</italic> or <italic>Sw-5.</italic> The practical use of these genes is limited because the resistance conferred by the genes can be overcome by naturally occurring strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. While common NBS-LRR resistances to virus are triggered by an Avr viral protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], the absence of viral involvement in the recognition of the <italic>Vat</italic> protein was clearly established by the fact that <italic>Vat</italic> plants are systemically infected when viruses are mechanically transmitted or transmitted by <italic>M. persicae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This phenomenon could ensure <italic>Vat</italic> durability against non-persistently transmitted virus. To overcome <italic>Vat</italic>-mediated resistance, viruses should evolve toward faster cell-to-cell movements after <italic>A. gossypii</italic> inoculative puncturing, to escape the resistance mechanisms induced by an <italic>A. gossypii</italic> effector. Such evolution has not been observed in our experimental evolution biotests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The resistance to viruses that is conferred on melon by <italic>A. gossypii</italic> puncturing appears durable, and this resistance is controlled by at least two loci, <italic>Vat-1</italic> and <italic>Vat-2</italic>, tightly linked.

These schemes suggested that aphid clones were adapted to plant resistance because their avirulence factors did not trigger resistance or because they could colonize the plants even if they elicited the defenses. If the latter is a general mechanism of plant resistance/aphid interactions, it would make the identification of avirulence factors challenging, given that adapted and non adapted clones could share a same avirulence effector interacting (directly or indirectly) with the protein encoded by the resistance gene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Aphid clones</title><p><italic>A. gossypii</italic> clones infesting melon belong to an host race group specialized on Cucurbitaceous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

We used the isolate I17F, belonging to the IA group (accession numbers HE793683, HE793684, Y18137), collected in France in 1975 on tomato. ZYMV and WMV are both belonging to the potyvirus genus. We used the isolate ZYMV-E15 (accession numbers JN861005 and AY189003) collected in France in 1979 on melon and the isolate WMV-FMF00-LL2 (accession number EU660578) collected in France in 2000 on zucchini.

Batches of 10 aphids were subsequently deposited on plantlets from the different accessions for virus inoculation. After 15&#x000a0;min, the aphids were removed. The plants were sprayed with pyrimicarb (NM1 clone) or endosulfan (all others clones) and placed into an insect proof glasshouse. The number of infected plants was determined 20&#x000a0;days after inoculation by visual assessment of symptoms. Each test was conducted with one aphid clone on a sub-set of accessions. At least 9 plantlets of each accession and 20 plantlets of the <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic lines were tested. For aphid clone/melon combinations exhibiting intermediate percentage of infected plants, new tests were performed to obtain an accurate interval of confidence, all-in 50 tests were performed.

Three days later, the number of aphids remaining on the plantlets was recorded as the &#x02018;Acceptance&#x02019; parameter. Seven days after aphid deposition, the adults were counted, and the density of nymphs was estimated on a scale of 0 to 6. The &#x02018;Colonization&#x02019; parameter at 7&#x000a0;days was calculated as [density of nymphs + ln(number of adults&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.001)]. The &#x02018;Acceptance&#x02019; and &#x02018;Colonization&#x02019; parameters were collected for at least 8 plantlets of each melon accession and 20 of the <italic>Vat</italic> transgenic TR3.

When the accuracy of &#x02018;Acceptance&#x02019; or &#x02018;Colonization&#x02019; parameters was not satisfying for a combination aphid clone/melon accession, the combination was tested again to obtain an accurate interval of confidence.

Initial inoculations were conducted following the procedure described above for plant rearing and virus sources with the exception of ZYMV, which used zucchini squash plants (cv Diamant) as the virus source. NM1 aphids collected in mass rearings were starved for 2&#x000a0;h and then transferred to CMV-infected leaves of V&#x000e9;drantais melon for 3&#x000a0;min virus acquisition. First, batches of 10 aphids were transferred to Margot plants for a 2-hour inoculation period. In the following tests we doubled the number of vectors or used the C9 clone as vector.
