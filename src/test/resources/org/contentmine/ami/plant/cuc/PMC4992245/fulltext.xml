Via bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation, miR159 has been found to regulate the expression of a family of <italic>GAMYB</italic> or <italic>GAMYB</italic>-like genes in a diverse range of plant species, including monocots such as barley and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], dicots such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], potato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and gymnosperms such as Larix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the considerable evolutionary distance that separates these species, the miR159 binding site in these <italic>MYB</italic> genes is conserved in both position and sequence, inferring this miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> relationship has a long co-evolutionary history. This strong conservation indicates this miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> relationship has been under strong selective pressure, presumably performing a critical function.</p><p>These <italic>GAMYB</italic> genes encode R2R3 MYB domain transcription factors that have been implicated in gibberellin (GA) signal transduction. Their role has been best characterised in anthers (tapetum) and seeds (aleurone), where a major role is to promote programmed cell death (PCD). In rice, a loss-of-function <italic>gamyb</italic> mutant is male sterile as the tapetum fails to undergo PCD and degenerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Likewise in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mutation of <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic>, the two major target genes of miR159, results in male sterility due to a tapetum that fails to degenerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Supporting these observations is the overexpression of miR159 in both cereals and Arabidopsis which results in male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], implying this GAMYB anther function has been strongly conserved. In the seed, GAMYB expression in barley or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> promotes aleurone vacuolation, also a GA-mediated PCD process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that in seeds where miR159 activity is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], these <italic>GAMYB-like</italic> genes are expressed, promoting a conserved PCD function.</p><p>By contrast, the functional role of the miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> pathway in vegetative tissues is not as clear. A role for miR159 in development has been suggested from genetic analysis in Arabidopsis. Previously, loss-of-function mutations have been isolated for all three Arabidopsis miR159 family members, miR159a-c. None of the three single mutants displayed a phenotype, but a <italic>mir159ab</italic> double mutant displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, that included stunted growth and rounded, upwardly curled leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This was consistent with deep sequencing; miR159a and miR159b were found to be overwhelmingly the major isoforms, composing approximately 90&#x000a0;% and 10&#x000a0;% of the miR159 reads respectively in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. By contrast, miR159c is very lowly expressed, and there are multiple lines of evidence indicating this miRNA is likely non-functional in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although miR159 is predicted to regulate approximately 20 different target genes in Arabidopsis, all the <italic>mir159ab</italic> pleiotropic vegetative defects are suppressed in a <italic>mir159ab.myb33.myb65</italic> quadruple mutant, genetically demonstrating that miR159 is functionally specific for <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic> in vegetative tissues, although this does not dismiss the possibility of miR159-mediated regulation of other targets that do not result in obvious developmental defects. Nevertheless, partly explaining this specificity is that many of the other potential miR159 targets are not transcribed in vegetative tissues, but rather their transcription is restricted to anthers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Together, these experiments have defined a highly active miR159-<italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>MYB65</italic> pathway present in Arabidopsis vegetative tissues.</p><p>Curiously, rosettes of a <italic>myb33.myb65</italic> double mutant have no major phenotypic defects, where multiple lines of evidence suggest that miR159-mediated silencing represses the expression of these genes to low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], raising the question of what functional role this pathway plays in rosettes. Although a role for <italic>MYB33</italic> in promoting flowering has been proposed, as miR159 overexpression in the Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> ecotype reduced <italic>MYB33</italic> transcript levels and delayed flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], no such impact was seen in the Columbia ecotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, flowering was neither delayed in <italic>myb33.myb65</italic> nor promoted in <italic>mir159ab</italic> indicating <italic>MYB33/MYB65</italic> are not major players in determining flowering-time in Columbia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, no clear rationale exists for this miR159-<italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>MYB65</italic> pathway in rosette/vegetative tissues, at least under standard growing conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, similar to many other highly conserved miRNAs, numerous studies that have quantified changes to miRNA levels have implicated miR159 in playing a response to a variety of stresses in a number of different species. This includes drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], UV-light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], waterlogging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or response to biotic stresses such as viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or bacterial lipopolysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Given MYB activity can impact vegetative growth its expression may adjust growth during stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, no clear trend in miR159 abundance emerges from these stress treatments, where in some instance miR159 abundance increases with stress treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and in others, miR159 abundance decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whether these changes result in significant physiological responses to these stresses and whether any potential role is widely conserved is unclear. Therefore, despite the miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> being strongly conserved across many species, what functional role this pathway plays in vegetative tissues remains unknown. To address this question, we have attempted to determine in what developmental stages of the rosette development are miR159 and <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> expressed/transcribed. We then investigate under what conditions miR159 is sufficiently suppressed enabling de-repression of <italic>MYB33/65</italic> expression, and whether this alteration in miR159 contributes to a physiological response to the stress. Such experiments will help determine what functional role the miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> pathway performs in vegetative tissues of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The miR159-<italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> module is ubiquitously present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> rosettes</title><p>To begin the characterisation of miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> rosettes, two time-course experiments were performed to determine in what developmental stages and rosette tissues miR159 and <italic>MYB33/65</italic> are expressed. Firstly, a qRT-PCR based transcript profiling was performed on a time-course of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> rosettes grown over 60&#x000a0;days to determine the abundance of mature miR159a/miR159b and the mRNA levels of <italic>MYB33/MYB65</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). However, <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> mRNA levels are not accurate indicators of their protein expression level due to the presence of a strong miR159-mediated translational repression mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether the mRNA levels of a downstream gene, <italic>CYSTEINE PROTEINASE1</italic> (<italic>CP1</italic>; At4g36880) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] would be an accurate indicator of MYB33/65 activity. We found <italic>CP1</italic> mRNA levels tightly correlate with <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic> mRNA levels in the absence of miR159 (the <italic>mir159ab</italic> mutant background; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Therefore, <italic>CP1</italic> levels are used throughout the study as an indicator of MYB33/MYB65 activity.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>MiR159 constitutively silences <italic>MYB33/65</italic> throughout rosette development. <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> Time-course transcript profiling of the miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> pathway in rosettes. The relative miRNA and mRNA levels were measured in rosettes approximately every 10&#x000a0;days throughout its development. The miR159 levels were normalized to <italic>sno101</italic>, the mRNA levels were normalized to <italic>CYCLOPHILIN</italic>. Values are the mean of three technical replicates with error bars representing the Standard Deviation (SD).

Staining was carried out on ten individual rosettes per time point, at ten-day interval during plant growth; only the first and last staining results are shown</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2016_867_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>It was found that both miR159a and miR159b were expressed throughout rosette development. Both miRNAs had similar developmental profiles, increasing approximately two-fold during the first half of rosette development and then decreasing slightly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Although for miR159a, there were no significant differences in miRNA levels at the different time points, independent time-courses confirmed this pattern and the approximate two-fold increase in miR159a abundance (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). For <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic>, their transcript levels fluctuated throughout rosette development. However, their levels did not inversely correlate with the miR159 profile, and so these observed differences are likely to be independent of regulation by miR159 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Additionally, these wild-type <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>MYB65</italic> transcript levels are approximately 10-fold lower compared to levels in 35-day-old <italic>mir159ab</italic> rosettes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1), suggesting <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>MYB65</italic> are being repressed throughout vegetative development. Supporting this notion, mRNA of the <italic>CP1</italic> marker gene remains low throughout wild-type rosette development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), as <italic>CP1</italic> mRNA in 35-day-old <italic>mir159ab</italic> rosettes is at least an order of magnitude higher (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). In <italic>mir159ab</italic> rosettes, the <italic>CP1</italic> mRNA abundance is similar to that of three-day-old wild-type seedlings, tissue that is known to have high MYB protein activity due to weak miR159 activity in seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on all the above data, <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic> mRNA is likely being continually repressed throughout wild-type rosette development, and that the fluctuations observed in their transcript levels may not have any functional significance.</p><p>To determine in what rosette tissues <italic>MIR159</italic> and its target <italic>MYB</italic> genes are transcribed, a &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS)-staining assay was carried out over a 60-day time course on two transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines; <italic>MIR159b:GUS</italic> and <italic>mMYB33:GUS</italic>. The <italic>MIR159b:GUS</italic> line was constructed by fusing the <italic>GUS</italic> gene downstream of the <italic>MIR159b</italic> promoter, to visualize the transcriptional domain of <italic>MIR159b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], while the <italic>mMYB33:GUS</italic> line carries a miR159-resistant version of <italic>MYB33</italic>, which enables visualization of the <italic>MYB33</italic> transcriptional domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The rosettes of each line were harvested and stained every ten days. It was found that the rosettes of both lines stained at all the tested time points, from young seedling (10-day-old) to the late reproductive (60-day-old) growth phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Moreover, the staining appeared ubiquitous throughout <italic>MIR159b:GUS</italic> and <italic>mMYB33:GUS</italic> rosettes. Patches of unstained cells in the older plants did not reflect a developmental pattern, but rather appeared to correspond to dead cells or a leaf staining penetration problem. Hence, both <italic>MIR159b</italic> and <italic>MYB33</italic> appear transcribed in all cells and at all rosette developmental stages. Together, the data suggests the strong constitutive expression of miR159 that suppresses the expression of the constitutively transcribed <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic> genes throughout <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> rosette development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>MiR159 is functionally active throughout rosette development</title><p>Since <italic>35S-miR159</italic> Arabidopsis plants have no obvious vegetative defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and miR159 appears to constantly silence <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic> under normal growth conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), a major impact of the miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> pathway in the rosette only appears possible if miR159 levels can be decreased enabling MYB33/MYB65 expression. To test this idea, a <italic>XVE-MIM159</italic> transgene was transformed into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). <italic>XVE</italic> is a transactivator that can be induced by estrogen (e.g. 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol), resulting in transcriptional activation of the downstream transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], while the <italic>MIM159</italic> gene carries a non-cleavable miR159 binding site that inhibits miR159 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Primary <italic>XVE-MIM159</italic> transformants were selected and grown for 21&#x000a0;days so that rosettes were well established, and were then treated with either 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol (inducer) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; dissolving solution, negative control). After two weeks of 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol treatment, rosettes contained upwardly curled leaves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This occurred in the older leaves of the plant, consistent with the older leaves of <italic>mir159ab</italic> displaying the strongest curl. Such phenotypes were not observed in <italic>XVE-MIM159</italic> transformants treated with just DMSO or in any wild-type plants grown under our conditions. Additionally, <italic>MYB33</italic>, <italic>MYB65</italic> and <italic>CP1</italic> mRNA levels were elevated in 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol treated <italic>XVE-MIM159</italic> plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Together, this data suggests that miR159 function is constantly active in developing rosettes and perturbation of this function results in de-repression of <italic>MYB33/65</italic> expression accompanied with morphological alterations to the rosette. This raises the possibility that the miR159-<italic>MYB</italic> module may be involved in response to environmental stress(es), where repression of miR159 by a stress may potentially activate <italic>MYB33/65</italic> expression, resulting in morphological alterations in response to the stress.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Morphological and molecular phenotypes via induced inhibition of miR159. <bold>a</bold> Application of 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol to 21-day-old <italic>XVE-MIM159</italic> transformants induced leaf-curling (red circled).

From our data we cannot rule out that MYB33/65 are expressed transiently or in a subtle cell type(s), where they may subtly impact development. However, it would appear that these genes are not playing a dominant role in Arabidopsis rosette developmental ontogeny, at least under standard laboratory growth conditions. Such a case is similar in rice, where the absence of <italic>GAMYB</italic> and <italic>GAMYB-like</italic> transcripts in vegetative tissues and the lack of obvious vegetative developmental abnormalities of a <italic>gamyb</italic> mutant, implies these genes play no major role in vegetative development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite the lack of clear function, the pathway remains active throughout rosette development as inducible inhibition of miR159 could induce leaf curling. Therefore, this led to the hypothesis that the miR159-<italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> pathway may be responsive to an abiotic stress, where if miR159 is repressed, de-repression of <italic>MYB33/65</italic> may possibly result in physiological/developmental outcomes that contribute to stress tolerance. Supporting such a possibility are numerous studies reporting the alteration of miR159 levels in response to stress, implicating miR159 as a general stress-responsive miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Despite this, we could find no evidence to indicate that miR159 becomes repressed under similar stress conditions, or changes in response to stress-related hormones such as ABA. Again, we cannot rule out that in certain cell types or under other stress conditions, or a combination of stress conditions, the miR159-<italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> pathway does play a role. For example, the <italic>myb33.myb65</italic> mutant has been shown to respond differently to wild-type after 4&#x000a0;h at 44&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

This also suggests that functionally relevant miR159 regulation of other targets is improbable as the absence of miR159 in the <italic>mir159ab.myb33.myb65</italic> mutant does not make a major difference under the tested stresses.

Both experiments suggest miR159 silencing of <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> is robust; given the morphological defects of the <italic>35S-P0</italic> plants or the transcript profiling in the TuMV challenged plants, it was likely that other endogenous miRNA pathways were strongly inhibited contributing in the observed morphological defects.</p><p>However, Du et al.

Interestingly, other <italic>GAMYB-like</italic> genes in Arabidopsis, such as <italic>MYB101</italic>, are predominantly transcribed in seeds and anthers, and this is also appears the case for <italic>GAMYB</italic> in cereals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], both of which strongly contrast the apparent ubiquitous transcription of <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Given that there are multiple <italic>GAMYB-like</italic> genes required for different steps of male development in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], during the duplication and divergence of <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic>, these genes appear to have acquired this near constitutive transcriptional domain. As the activity of <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic> promotes male fertility, there would be strong selection pressure for their strong expression. Hence, we speculate this may result in strong transcription not only in the anther, but also in vegetative tissues. Any negative impact of unnecessary <italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> transcription in vegetative tissues (followed by the required miR159 silencing), would be vastly outweighed by enhanced male fertility. Indeed, although it could be considered that this miR159-<italic>MYB33</italic>/<italic>65</italic> &#x0201c;futile&#x0201d; pathway may be energetically wasteful, there appears no obvious difference between wild-type and <italic>mir159ab.myb33.myb65</italic> rosettes, and so such an energy investment may be not be large enough to confer a selective disadvantage. Therefore, we speculate, that if a gene is miRNA-regulated, there may be less pressure on cis-acting promoter elements to define its required spatial/temporal transcription pattern, as post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs provides an alternative mechanism to achieve the required protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used in all experiments and is referred to as wild type.
