The accumulation of ABA is controlled by the enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). In Arabidopsis, <italic>NCED3</italic> is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism by ABA. In this study in peanut (<italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic>), we demonstrate that ABA biosynthesis is also controlled by negative feedback regulation, mediated by the inhibitory effect on <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription of a protein complex between transcription factors AhNAC2 and AhAREB1. <italic>AhNCED1</italic> was significantly down-regulated after PEG treatment for 10&#x02009;h, at which time ABA content reached a peak. A ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 binding to the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter in response to ABA. Moreover, the interaction between AhAREB1 and AhNAC2, and a transient expression assay showed that the protein complex could negatively regulate the expression of <italic>AhNCED1</italic>. The results also demonstrated that AhAREB1 was the key factor in <italic>AhNCED1</italic> feedback regulation, while AhNAC2 played a subsidiary role. ABA reduced the rate of AhAREB1 degradation and enhanced both the synthesis and degradation rate of the AhNAC2 protein. In summary, the AhAREB1/AhNAC2 protein complex functions as a negative feedback regulator of drought-induced ABA biosynthesis in peanut.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Plants encounter various environmental stresses throughout life, of which drought is one of the most serious adverse factors restricting plant survival, growth and yield. Abscisic acid (ABA), a key plant stress-signaling hormone, is produced in response to drought and counteracts the effects of this stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The accumulation of ABA under drought stress conditions is primarily due to the induction of ABA biosynthetic genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The step involving 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), which cleaves xanthoxin to produce 9-cis-violaxanthin and 9-cis-neoxanthin, is thought to be rate-limiting in the ABA biosynthesis pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are five <italic>NCED</italic> (<italic>AtNCED</italic>) genes. Among them, <italic>AtNCED3</italic> plays a key role in ABA biosynthesis during water stress, when the corresponding NCED3 protein accumulates around leaf vascular tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The <italic>nced3</italic> mutant line exhibits reduced ABA content, which exacerbates water stress; in contrast, overexpression of <italic>NCED3</italic> increases ABA content and enhances survival of water stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Genes from other species behave similarly: Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> transformed <italic>MhNCED3</italic>, the key ABA biosynthesis gene in <italic>Malus hupehensis</italic>, into Arabidopsis, and the resulting transgenic lines contained higher endogenous ABA levels and showed a higher drought resistance than wild-type.</p><p>The NAC (petunia NAM and Arabidopsis ATAF1, ATAF2 and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) are plant-specific and form one of the largest TF families in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. NAC TFs function in multiple developmental processes, as well as in abiotic stress-responsive signaling. For example, NAC019, NAC055 and NAC072 are all induced by drought stress, and transgenic lines constructed with the corresponding genes show strong drought tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Similarly, overexpression of another NAC TF gene, <italic>ATAF1</italic>, results in improved drought tolerance; ChIP-qPCR (Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) shows that ATAF1 binding to the <italic>NCED3</italic> promoter correlates with increased <italic>NCED3</italic> expression and ABA hormone levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Several stress-inducible NAC TFs are also induced by ABA: levels of <italic>TaNAC29</italic>, a NAC TF from wheat, are increased by ABA treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. NAC072/RD26 regulates drought-responsive genes in the ABA-dependent pathway, as shown by upregulation of ABA-responsive genes in <italic>RD26</italic> overexpression lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. NAC TFs often target similar consensus sequences in promoter regions, including the NACRES [NAC recognition site, CGT(G/A)] and CDBS (core DNA-binding sequence, CACG) motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. NAC019 and NAC055 can interact with the CDBS element in the promoter of <italic>VSP1</italic>, a jasmonic acid-induced defense response gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, ANAC016, a NAC TF affecting drought-responsive signaling, binds to a NAC016-specific binding motif that does not contain the CDBS NAC binding motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>The ABRE binding factor/ABRE binding protein (ABF/AREB) TFs, with nine examples encoded in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, have pivotal functions in ABA-dependent regulation of gene expression under drought stress and represent a subfamily of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TF family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis, AREB1/ABF2, AREB2/ABF4</italic> and <italic>ABF3</italic> are highly induced by ABA and osmotic stress treatment, while <italic>ABF1</italic> also controls the TFs downstream of ABA signaling, despite having a lower expression level than <italic>ABF2, ABF3</italic> and <italic>ABF4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>AREB1/ABF2, AREB2/ABF4</italic> or <italic>ABF3</italic> exhibit increased ABA sensitivity and improved drought tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The triple AREB/ABF mutant <italic>areb1 areb2 abf3</italic> exhibits enhanced ABA insensitivity and reduced tolerance to drought compared with wild-type<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Promoter analysis reveals that most ABA-responsive genes are regulated by ABREs (PyACGTGG/TC), which contain a core ACGT sequence and belong to the G-box (CACGTG) family. Various ABRE-like sequences have been reported, including coupling element (CGCGTG), CE3, <italic>hex3</italic> and motif III<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>A positive feedback mechanism regulates ABA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, where the <italic>ABA1, ABA2, ABA3, NCED3</italic> and <italic>AAO3</italic> genes are induced by NaCl and ABA; in particular, water stress is a major factor in the induction of <italic>NCED3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Exogenous ABA enhances the expression of <italic>NCED3</italic> via a distal ABA responsive element (ABRE: GGCACGTG, &#x02212;2372 to &#x02212;2364 bp) in its promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, the positive feedback regulation of <italic>NCED3</italic> expression by ABA raises the question of how the plant maintains ABA homeostasis during water stress. In previous work on peanut (<italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic>), an important cash crop, we cloned and identified <italic>NCED1</italic> (<italic>AhNCED1</italic>), <italic>NAC2</italic> (<italic>AhNAC2</italic>) and <italic>AREB1</italic> (<italic>AhAREB1</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Furthermore, we showed that both <italic>AhNAC2</italic> and <italic>AhAREB1</italic> are induced by ABA in peanut, and that, in an Arabidopsis <italic>AhAREB1</italic>-overexpression line, transcription of <italic>AtNCED3</italic> is significantly suppressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter was also cloned, and bioinformatics analysis showed that it contained one NACRE and four ABRE core sequence elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The ABRE element overlapped with or was located close to NACRE motifs in the &#x02212;1500 to &#x02212;300 bp region of the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter. To understand the possible mechanisms of negative feedback regulation of ABA biosynthesis, we decided to investigate whether AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 can coordinate negative control of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> expression in peanut. In this study, we report that, during the response to ABA, AhAREB1 functions as a negative regulator of the ABA biosynthesis gene <italic>AhNCED1</italic>, acting synergistically with AhNAC2, with which it forms a protein complex. In addition, ABA plays an important role in water stress-induced feedback control of peanut ABA biosynthesis by affecting the stability of AhAREB1.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>AhNAC2 physically interacts with AhAREB1</title><p>To investigate whether AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 physically bind to each other, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, negative control combinations, such as AD/BD, AD-AhNAC2/BD, AD/BD-AhAREB1 and T/lam, did not interact, while co-expression of AD-AhNAC2 and BD-AhAREB1 showed strong interaction, as indicated by growth on SD W-L-H-A selective plates. <italic>In vitro</italic> pull-down assays, using His-AhNAC2 and GST-AhAREB1 fusion proteins, were performed to verify the interaction of AhNAC2 and AhAREB1, with GST protein alone acting as a negative control. These experiments showed that His-AhNAC2 binds to GST-AhAREB1, but not GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To further confirm the interaction between AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) was performed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> protoplasts. A strong YFP fluorescence signal was observed when AhAREB1-EYFP<sup>C</sup> and AhNAC2-EYFP<sup>N</sup> or AhNAC2-EYFP<sup>C</sup> and AhAREB1-EYFP<sup>N</sup> were co-expressed in the same cells, while negative combinations, such as AhNAC2-EYFP<sup>C</sup>/EYFP<sup>N</sup>, EYFP<sup>C</sup>/AhNAC2-EYFP<sup>N</sup>, AhAREB1-EYFP<sup>C</sup>/EYFP<sup>N</sup> and EYFP<sup>C</sup>/AhAREB1-EYFP<sup>N</sup>, gave only background fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In all, these results indicate that AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 form a protein complex and thus might act together to regulate target genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 directly target the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter region following ABA treatment</title><p><italic>AhNCED1</italic> contains one NACRE and four ABRE core sequences in the &#x02212;1500 to &#x02212;300 bp region of its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To examine whether AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 execute their function by binding to the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed in peanut. We designed five pairs (<italic>pN1-pN6</italic>) of primers that correspond to regions within the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter and used PCR fragments generated from these in ChIP-qPCR assays. The results showed that, in the absence of ABA, AhAREB1 protein binding was enriched in the <italic>pN4</italic> region of the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter, while AhNAC2 was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>).

In the <italic>pN1</italic> region, which contains the most distal ABRE core sequence, only AhAREB1 was enriched in response to ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). These results suggest that AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 might regulate <italic>AhNCED1</italic> expression by binding to specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in its promoter in response to ABA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 co-regulate <italic>AhNCED1</italic> expression by feedback inhibition in response to ABA</title><p>To test whether AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 regulate the expression of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> by binding to the ABRE or NACRE <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in its promoter, we co-expressed <italic>AhAREB1</italic> or <italic>AhNAC2</italic>, and either <italic>pAhNCED1-Luc</italic> or <italic>pAhNCED1&#x00394;-Luc</italic> (the latter has a mutation in the NACRE or ABRE motifs, where CACG/CGTG is changed to AAAA, in the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) vectors in wild-type Arabidopsis protoplasts. As expected, the addition of AhNAC2 or AhAREB1 significantly down-regulated the expression of <italic>pAhNCED1-Luc</italic>, and ABA treatment enhanced this inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). When <italic>AhNAC2</italic> and <italic>pAhNCED1&#x00394;-Luc</italic> constructs were co-transfected into protoplasts, none of the individual mutations in the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter influenced AhNAC2 inhibition of <italic>pAhNCED1&#x00394;-Luc</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, when we transfected the <italic>AhAREB1</italic> construct together with <italic>pAhNCED1&#x00394;1-Luc</italic> or <italic>pAhNCED1&#x00394;2-Luc</italic> into protoplasts, the inhibition by AhAREB1 alone was dramatically reduced. This suggests that AhAREB1 negatively regulates <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription by binding to the ABRE element located at &#x02212;1367 bp or to the NACRE motif located at &#x02212;1308 bp in the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>To further examine whether AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 coordinately regulate <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription, <italic>AhAREB1, AhNAC2</italic> and <italic>pAhNCED1-Luc</italic> vectors were co-transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts. We fixed the plasmid concentration of one TF, and gradually increased the concentration of the other one to identify its function in coordinate regulation.

When 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g <italic>AhNAC2</italic>, 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g <italic>AhAREB1</italic> and <italic>pAhNCED1-Luc</italic> vectors were used, <italic>Luc</italic> activity decreased to 84.8% of controls. Importantly, even when the amount of AhAREB1 vector transfected was increased to 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, <italic>Luc</italic> activity was reduced to 55.8%, meaning that the negative regulation of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> depends on the amount of AhAREB1 protein present. In brief, the relative luciferase activities were much lower when treated with both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The inhibition of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter activity by AhNAC2 or AhAREB1 was enhanced by ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, to examine whether AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 bind directly to the core ABRE sequence, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using recombinant GST-AhAREB1 and His-AhNAC2 proteins and a biotinylated probe containing the ABRE cis-acting element from the &#x02212;1367 locus of the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A nonlabeled probe with mutated ABRE was also used as cold competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 were able to bind to the ABRE <italic>cis</italic>-acting element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, the binding of AhNAC2 to the ABRE motif could be reduced by adding AhAREB1 protein into the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these findings strongly support the idea that <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription is inhibited by an AhNAC2-AhAREB1 protein complex.

A rapid 67-fold increase in the expression of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> was observed after 2&#x02009;h PEG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, perhaps more interesting is the subsequent significant downregulation of the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> gene after 8&#x02009;h PEG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To determine whether AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 are involved in this down regulation, immunoblotting assays were performed to assess the respective protein levels during water stress. We found that both AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 accumulated in response to PEG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). An HPLC assay showed that, as expected, ABA levels increased to a maximum after 10&#x02009;h PEG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Together with the ChIP analysis for AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), which showed that ABA promotes the binding of both TFs to the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter, these results suggest that an AhAREB1/AhNAC2 protein complex is involved in the water stress-induced feedback control of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ABA influences the accumulation of both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1</title><p>To further confirm the role of ABA in this feedback regulation, we investigated the accumulation of AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 proteins in response to ABA.

However, the overall AhNAC2 protein levels remained stable, despite ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Intriguingly, when peanut seedlings were pretreated with CHX (cycloheximide) for 6&#x02009;h to inhibit translation, AhNAC2 protein content was rapidly reduced in the presence of ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p>The proteasome provides the major proteolytic activity in plants, and MG132 inhibits this activity.

In peanut, like in other plants, ABA content is markedly enhanced during water stress, in parallel with a significant increase in AhNCED1 protein levels; AhNCED1 has been identified as the key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis under water stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Previous studies demonstrated that the <italic>NCED</italic> gene can be induced by exogenous ABA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

However, ABA is likely to be involved, probably as part of a negative feedback mechanism, because such regulation by the product (s) of a biosynthetic pathway is ubiquitous in plants. For example, bioactive gibberellin (GA), involved in stem elongation, seed germination and root elongation, provides feedback regulation of GA 2-oxidase biosynthesis genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Here, we identified two TFs, AhAREB1 and AhNAC2, which form a protein complex in peanut to mediate ABA-dependent negative feedback regulation of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). AhAREB1 plays a central role in this process, while AhNAC2 functions as an enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). What is noteworthy is that ABA increases the inhibitory effect of AhNAC2 or AhAREB1 on <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), and affects the accumulation of both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). ABA achieves this by enhancing both the synthesis and degradation rate of AhNAC2 to maintain stable protein levels, while levels of AhAREB1 are increased by reducing its degradation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between NAC and AREB TFs, which has mostly been researched in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, is complex. The expression of three <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC TFs, ANAC072, ANAC019 and ANAC055, is induced in response to ABA, and a yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that key AREBs (ABF3, ABF4) bind to the promoters of all three of the corresponding genes via the ABRE core <italic>cis</italic>-acting element, which occurs several times within each NAC promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. <italic>NAC016</italic> is also involved in drought stress responses: overexpression of <italic>NAC016</italic> results in low drought tolerance, while <italic>nac016</italic> mutants have high drought tolerance, suggesting that NAC016 works as a negative regulatory factor in drought stress. Furthermore, both NAC016 and the product of its target gene <italic>NAC-like, activated by AP3/PI (NAP)</italic> directly bind to the promoter of <italic>AREB1</italic> and repress its transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. AREB1 encodes a TF with a central role in the stress-responsive ABA signaling pathway.</p><p>A previous study suggested that ABA affects ABF1 and ABF3 protein accumulation by post-translational regulation, while ABA can suppress the interaction between the ubiquitin E3 ligase KEEP ON GOING (KEG) and ABFs to slow their proteolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Levels of NAC1, an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC TF with a role in the auxin signaling pathway, can be increased by treatment with MG132, indicating that NAC1 may be regulated by a post-translational mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that AhAREB1 is the key negative regulator of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> expression, while AhNAC2 is simply an enhancer of this inhibitory effect. Furthermore, both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 can improve the drought tolerance of the plant by inducing stress-related gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, meaning that both TFs are activators of the ABA signaling pathway.</p><p>The negative feedback regulation of ABA biosynthesis in peanut, mediated by AhAREB1, contrasts with the situation in Arabidopsis, where a positive feedback mechanism of ABA biosynthesis regulation has been reported, with the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element ABRE playing a critical role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In tomato, similarly to peanut, a negative feedback mechanism has been found<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Thus, water stress causes a rapid increase in endogenous ABA in WT tomato leaves, such that high levels are attained after 6&#x02009;h, which continue to increase through until 24&#x02009;h of the treatment. At the same time, the expression of <italic>NCED1</italic> reaches a maximum at 6&#x02009;h after imposition of the stress and then reduces until the 24&#x02009;h time point. Similar observations were made in tomato root<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Bioinformatics analysis of the 2000-bp upstream region of <italic>NCED1</italic> (GenBank Accession no. SGN-U577478) in tomato showed that it contains two <italic>cis</italic>-acting ABRE elements and three <italic>cis</italic>-acting NACRE core elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). This might indicate that the negative feedback regulatory mechanism of ABA biosynthesis we observed in peanut is a more general phenomenon in plants, even though it has not yet been found in Arabidopsis. The regulation of ABA biosynthesis is likely to be complex, however, involving both positive and negative mechanisms. In this regard, we note that, although AhAREB1 acts on the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter as a negative transcription factor in response to ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), only the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the <italic>pN1</italic> and <italic>pN2</italic> regions are involved in this negative regulation. We predict that <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in other regions of the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> promoter might feature in other forms of regulation of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription.</p><p>The results described in this paper are all consistent with the following description of events. After 2&#x02009;h PEG treatment in peanut, the expression level of the <italic>AhNCED1</italic> gene reaches a peak. The level of AhNAC2/AhAREB1 protein complex increases as both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 proteins accumulate, leading to partial inhibition of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> expression. ABA improves both the synthesis and degradation rate of AhNAC2 protein and slows AhAREB1 protein degradation so that the latter accumulates within cells. AhAREB1 plays the key role in the feedback regulation of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription, while AhNAC2 is an enhancer of this process. Both AhNAC2 and AhAREB1 are activators in the response to water stress and induce the expression of stress-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant growth and treatments</title><p>Seeds of peanut (<italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic>) were sown and grown as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.
