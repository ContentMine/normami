Nearly 830 million hectares of the land are affected by salt&#x02013;alkali stress, and over 434 million hectares are alkalinized soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Alkaline salt stress and neutral salt stress are two distinct kinds of stresses for plants and should be called alkali stress and salt stress. Salt stress in the soil generally involves osmotic stress and ion injury, while alkali stress has an added high-pH effect. The high-pH directly affects the absorption of mineral elements and interferes with ionic balance. Thus, the effects of soil alkalinization on plants resulting from high concentrations of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> may be more destructive than the effects of soil salinization induced by the accumulation of neutral salts, such as NaCl and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The plant response to salinity stress has been exhaustively researched, but much less attention has been paid to analysing the effect of soil alkalinity on plant growth and development. The identification of alkali&#x02013;responsive genes may provide valuable information on understanding the genetic basis of plants to alkali stress and improve alkali tolerance of crops by genetic engineering.</p><p>Wheat is an important crop in the world because of its high production (678 million tons in 2009, FAO), wide geographical range and high proportion of human consumption. Wheat is a glycophyte which is relatively sensitive to both salinity and alkalinity stress. However, two wheat lines, named as Shanrong No. 4 (SR4) and Shanrong No. 3 (SR3) were reported as salinity tolerant lines due to their more tolerant of salinity than JN177 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which were selected from the derivatives of an asymmetric somatic hybridization between the salinity sensitive line, bread wheat cultivar Jinan 177 (JN177) and the highly tolerant related species, tall wheatgrass (<italic>Thinopyrum ponticum</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Transcriptomic and proteomic experiments showed that imposing salinity stress induced the differential up- or down-regulation of many genes present in SR3, and some of these, when expressed as transgenes, produced a marked positive impact on the plant&#x02019;s level of salinity tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although field trials showed that SR3 out-performs SR4 in pH neutral saline soils, the reverse was the case in alkaline pH saline soils (unpublished data). Thus, while SR3 had been registered as a salinity tolerant cultivar, SR4 was recommended for cultivation on high pH soils which is, therefore, a suitable material for identifying alkalinity tolerant associate genes.</p><p>Genome scale analysis of gene expression profiles is a powerful method to understand biological functions, such as cell differentiation, development and stress responses. With the increasing availability of sequencing data, expression profiling has been widely used in recent years to identify genes that are involved in the adaptive responses to drought and other abiotic stresses. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing and digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling are efficient and cost-effective methods for characterizing non-model organisms without the need for a reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. DGE is particularly useful for identifying differentially expressed genes, thanks to its capacity to detect unknown and low abundance transcripts, and to generate absolute (rather than relative) transcript abundances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Recently, some studies for alkaline-stress responses have been reported in <italic>Glycine soja</italic>, <italic>Leymus chinensis</italic> and <italic>Tamarix hispida</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; however, there is still little information about the alkaline-stress responses of common wheat. The present study focuses on the short-term and more sustained responses of the wheat root to alkalinity stress, by contrasting the SR4 transcriptome with that of JN177 using DGE profiling method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The plant response to alkalinity stress</title><p>The growth of seedlings and their roots of wheat line, SR4 was less inhibited than that of wheat cultivar JN177 when they were grown in the presence of the alkalinity stress.

</p><p>The high-salt environments in alkaline soil can break the ion homeostasis of plant cells; moreover, the high-pH caused by alkali stress directly affects the absorption of mineral elements. To understanding how SR4 adapt to overcome alkali stress, we analyzed the ion contents in roots of SR4 and JN177. The alkaline medium induced an increased Na<sup>+</sup> and decreased K<sup>+</sup> contents, overall lowering the K<sup>+</sup>&#x02044;Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in the roots of both wheats. The effect of the stress on root Na<sup>+</sup> content was more marked for JN177 than for SR4, and vice versa for root K<sup>+</sup> content (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). SR4 line maintained a higher root K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio than that in JN177 cultivar. Root Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and total Fe concentrations were increased by the alkalinity stress in both cultivars, but SR4 maintained a higher level of root Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and total Fe content than that of JN177 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c&#x02013;e</xref>).

</p><p>The high-pH caused by alkali stress can also directly affect the internal pH of the plant. To investigate how SR4 adapt to overcome the high-pH under alkali stress, we detected the intracellular pH in roots of both wheats by using pH indicator 2&#x02032;7&#x02032;-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Under alkalinity stress, the BCECF fluorescence was decreased in root of both SR4 and JN177 compared to non-stressed condition, however, the fluorescence intensity was much lower in SR4 than in JN177 under alkalinity stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;d</xref>). Since the BCECF fluorescence intensity was proportional to the intracellular pH (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), we calculated the intracellular pH in root of both SR4 and JN177 according to BCECF fluorescence intensity. Results indicated that the intracellular pH fell about 0.1 and 0.2 pH unit in JN177 and SR4, respectively, under alkalinity stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The intracellular pH of seedling roots of JN177 and SR4 under non-alkalinity and alkalinity stress conditions. <bold>a</bold>-<bold>d</bold> Fluorescence images for JN177 and SR4 under non-alkalinity stress (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>) and under 100 mM alkali salts (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>). <bold>e</bold> The fluorescence intensity is proportional to pH. <bold>f</bold> The intracellular pH of seedling roots of JN177 and SR4.

</p><p>Environmental stresses including alkali stress can induce the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which if not controlled, can pose a threat to cells. Thus, plants have developed antioxidant mechanisms to eliminate superfluous ROS under alkaline-saline stress, in which superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) are most important antioxidative enzymes. To assess whether SR4 can effectively scavenge ROS under alkali stress, we detected the ROS content and activity of major ROS scavenging enzymes in roots of both wheats. ROS can degrade polyunsaturated lipids to form malondialdehyde (MDA), which is generally taken as a marker of oxidative stress, thus we also detected the content of MDA in roots of both SR4 and JN177. Both O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> radicals and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was raised by alkali stress in wheats, and both cultivars accumulated similar level of ROS in the absence of alkalinity stress, but, in the presence of stress, SR4 accumulated ROS less than JN177 did (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Similarly, root MDA content was raised by the stress, but less so in SR4 than in JN177 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). With respect to the activities of the ROS scavenging enzymes SOD, APX, GPX, CAT and POD, the activity of CAT was consistently higher in SR4 than in JN177 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>); the activities of SOD, APX and GPX were inhibited by the stress, but the activity level of SOD and APX were consistently higher in SR4 than in JN177 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f&#x02013;h</xref>); while the activity of POD was unaffected by the stress in SR4, but its activity was increased in JN177 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>). These results were fully consistent with the alkalinity tolerance profiles which showed that SR4 displaying a superior tolerance of alkalinity stress than JN177.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Content of ROS and activities of ROS scavenging enzymes of seedling roots of JN177 and SR4 under non-alkalinity and alkalinity stress conditions. <bold>a</bold> Root O<sub>2</sub>

In SR4 there were also GO categories for response to ROS, epigenetic regulation of gene expression and protein targeting, while RNA modification was over-represented in JN177. In SR4, a group of 62 differential expressed genes were associated with signal transduction and 61 genes in transcription regulation, which included genes encoding calcium sensors, protein kinases, alternative splicing factors and various transcription factors. Another 22 genes were associated with protein modification, among which were proteins involved in phosphorylation, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modification, ubiquitin modification and ubiquitin-like modification. There were 37 genes encoding ion transport proteins, 27 genes encoding enzymes participating in lipid metabolism, organic acid metabolism and phenylpropanoid metabolic processes, 23 genes associated with ROS scavenging, 22 genes encoding chaperones, five genes involved in DNA damage repair and five genes involved in chromatin structure remodeling.

The ability of plants challenged with alkalinity stress to take up K<sup>+</sup> is typically weakened, which also leads to the over- uptaking of the toxic ion Na<sup>+</sup>.

The qRT-PCR analysis also indicated that a nitrate transporter gene <italic>NRT1</italic> was induced in SR4 under alkalinity stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Moreover, the NO<sub>3</sub>

The implication is that the genetic make-up of SR4 allows it, when exposed to alkalinity stress, to better maintain an adequate supply of key anions than can JN177. A high soil pH has a significant impact on the availability of a number of important cations (notably Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>), with further negative consequences for the ion homeostasis and nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Graminaceous plants acquire Fe<sup>3+</sup> by releasing phytosiderophores able to chelate the ion.

The present analysis revealed that two putative Fe phytosiderophore transporter genes were up-regulated by alkalinity stress in SR4 and that their transcript abundance was higher than in JN177. In addition, a number of other cation transporter genes were induced by alkalinity stress in SR4, and two of these (encoding a Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporter and a putative Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter) were differentially up-regulated in alkalinity stressed SR4.

Part of the resistance mechanism against alkalinity stress involves the expenditure of energy to control both the intracellular and rhizosphere pH. Eukaryotic cells have evolved for this purpose various ion pumps, such as plasma membrane proton translocating ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases), vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (V-ATPases) and proton pyrophosphatase (H<sup>+</sup>-PPases). V-ATPases form part of the cellular machinery responsible for regulating intracellular pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], while H<sup>+</sup>-PPases act to complement V-ATPase transport activity through the acidification of intracellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The DGE analysis revealed a number of genes encoding V-ATPase or H<sup>+</sup>-PPase being induced by alkalinity stress; some of these were more abundantly transcribed in SR4 than in JN177. Measurement of intracellular pH also indicated that the root intracellular pH decreased in both alkalinity stressed JN177 and SR4, moreover, it was much lower in SR4 than in JN177 under alkalinity stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which coincide with the DGE data. The implication is that SR4 may be better able than JN177, through its use of various V-ATPases and H<sup>+</sup>-PPases, to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis when challenged with alkalinity stress.</p><p>The plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases of plant cells establish the pH and membrane potential gradients across the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and some recent research has shown that plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase appears to mediate proton secretion during the adaptation of the root to alkaline stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The present transcriptomic analysis identified the differential up-regulation of one gene in SR4 encoding a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene, both under non-stressed and alkalinity stressed conditions. In addition there were three differentially regulated genes encoding a DnaJ homolog chaperone, as well as one encoding a 14-3-3-like protein.

One such mechanism could operate through alterations in the chromatin, involving both non-sequence changes to the DNA (eg through cytosine methylation) and covalent modifications to the histone (eg acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation) or even the replacement of canonical histones by specific variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

The somatic hybridization process (as used to generate SR4, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]) has been shown to induce wholesale alterations in cytosine methylation patterns, and some of these have been implicated in underlying the heightened salinity tolerance displayed by SR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Both cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation variants are believed to be responsible for regulating the level of transcription of certain salinity stress responsive genes in SR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The present transcriptomic analysis identified eight genes involved in epigenetic regulation (encoding various histone variants, a DNA methyltransferase, a histone deacetylase and a chromatin assembly factor protein) which were differentially transcribed between SR4 and JN177, and six of these genes were up-regulated by the imposition of alkalinity stress for 24 h and showed higher expression level in SR4 than in JN177. Whether epigenetic modifications are involved in alkali stress responses and its contribution to the alkali tolerance in SR4 will require further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Alkali stress was normally closely related to salt stress in soil; however, alkali stress and salt stress are two distinct kinds of stresses for plants. Salt stress consists of the low water potentials and ion toxicities factors, while alkali stress has an added high-pH effect, which is the major feature of alkalinity stress. The high pH surrounding the roots could direct some ions to precipitate, which may destroy the nutrient supply and ion balance around the roots. Moreover, a high soil pH can also directly affect the internal pH of the plant. Bread wheat cultivar SR4 expresses a superior tolerance to alkaline stress than its parent cultivar JN177. This study showed that this superiority are due to its capability in taking up nutritionally important anions and cations, in having a more active ROS scavenging ability and also probably in regulating both the plant&#x02019;s internal pH and that of its rhizosphere. Since higher ROS scavenging ability was also involved in the salinity tolerance of another somatic introgression wheat cultivar SR3, considering the extra high pH effect of alkalinity stress compared with salinity stress, the high absorbing ability for nutrient ions and the good regulating ability for intracellular and rhizosphere pH might be more important for alkali tolerance of wheat. All of the evidences provide clues for uncovering the tolerance of SR4 to the alkalinity stress and broaden our understanding of the mechanism of wheat to alkalinity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) cultivar Shanrong No. 4 (SR4) used in this study is a derivative of an asymmetric somatic hybrid between bread wheat cultivar JN177 and tall wheatgrass (<italic>Th. ponticum</italic>) created by Dr. Guangmin Xia, and the detail information about asymmetric somatic hybridization was described in Xia&#x02019;s report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

The strength of the NBT signal was estimated from a digital image of the stained tissue with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The polymerization product after NBT staining can reflect the O<sub>2</sub>

The roots of JN177 and SR4 were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C in incubation buffer (pH 6.2) containing 10 mM MOPS, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% pluronic F-127 and 10 &#x003bc;M BCECF-AM. Loading was terminated by rinsing the roots three times in incubation buffer lacking the dye. BCECF-AM loaded into the cytoplasm was hydrolyzed to BCECF by esterase. The intracellular pH was monitored by measuring the fluorescence of BCECF with a laser scan confocal microscope (LSM700, Zesis, Germany). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm and emission wavelength was 525 nm. The pH showed a linear relationship with fluorescence intensity over the pH ranges 6.4-7.6. For pH calibration, the wheat roots were incubated in the dark in calibration buffer (pH6.6, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.6) containing 10 mM MOPS, 130 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaCl, 0.05% pluronic F-127, 10 &#x003bc;g/mL nigericin and 10 &#x003bc;M BCECF-AM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Tag libraries were constructed from root mRNAs extracted from alkalinity-stressed (both 0.5 h and 24 h exposure times) JN177 and SR4 plants, as well as from the non-stressed roots of both cultivars. Magnetic beads coated with polyT were used to isolate the mRNA fraction of a 30 &#x003bc;g aliquot of total RNA. Double strand cDNA synthesized from this mRNA was digested with <italic>Nla</italic>III, an enzyme which cleaves at the sequence CATG. <italic>Nla</italic>III-restricted 3&#x02032; cDNA fragments were purified by Oligo(dT) beads, then the Illumina adaptor 1 is ligated to the sticky 5&#x02032; end, which retains the CATG site. The fragments were further digested with <italic>Mme</italic>I (this enzyme cleaves 17 bp downstream of the CATG site), then ligated to Illumina adaptor 2 to construct a 21 bp tag library with different adaptors at both ends. After linear PCR amplification based on the primer pair corresponding to the adaptors, the amplified samples were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The quality of the constructed library was analyzed by Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. The tag library was finally sequenced using a HiSeq 2000 device (Illumina). The short-read sequence data from the six libraries are respectively deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>) with accession number SRR3223630, SRR3223636, SRR3223646, SRR3223672, SRR3223674 and SRR3223675. Adaptor tags (the raw sequences containing 3&#x02032; adaptor sequences), empty reads (reads with only 3&#x02032; adaptor sequences but no Tags), low-quality tags (tags with ambiguous base calls), tags of unusual length (longer or shorter than 21 nt) and nonredundant tags (tags with a copy number less than 2) were removed from the raw data, yielding a dataset consisting of clean tags. Subsequently, the clean tags were classified according to their copy number in the library, their percentage of total clean tags was calculated, and the saturation of the library was analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Differential transcription</title><p>The frequency of each tag in the various cDNA libraries was used to infer differential transcription. To identify genes involved, the reference sequences from NCBI wheat EST collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/Triticum_aestivum/Ta.seq.uniq.gz">http://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniGene/Triticum_aestivum/Ta.seq.uniq.gz</ext-link>) or IWGSC wheat genomic DNA sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftpmips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plants/wheat/IWGSC/genePrediction_v2.2/">ftp://ftpmips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plants/wheat/IWGSC/genePrediction_v2.2/</ext-link>) were searched for CATG sites, all the possible CATG&#x02009;+&#x02009;17 nt sequences were used as a reference tag library for following clean tags mapping. All clean tags were mapped to the reference tag library with perfect match or allowing a 1 nt mismatch (there might be SNPs between different varieties) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], conducting by a Perl program through string matching. Tags identifying more than one gene were removed, and the number of remaining unambiguous tags was normalized to TPM (number of transcripts per million clean tags). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), an algorithm to identify differential transcript accumulation between different samples (alkalinity vs no alkalinity treatment, SR4 vs JN177) was used according to Audic and Claverie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.001 and a log2 ratio threshold of 1 were applied as the criteria for declaring differential transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Gene ontology (GO) assignments and enrichment analysis was conducted to assign biological process, cellular component and molecular function through hypergeometric test to map all differentially expressed genes to terms in GO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo</ext-link>), looking for significantly enriched GO terms in DEGs comparing to the genome background.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)</title><p>Total root RNA extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) provided the template for a qRT-PCR assay.
