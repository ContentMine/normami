(Indian sandalwood) is an economically important plant species because of its ability to produce highly valued perfume oils. Little is known about the mechanisms by which <italic>S. album</italic> adapts to low temperatures. In this study, we obtained 100,445,724 raw reads by paired-end sequencing from <italic>S. album</italic> leaves. Physiological and transcriptomic changes in sandalwood seedlings exposed to 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 0&#x02013;48&#x02009;h were characterized. Cold stress induced the accumulation of malondialdehyde, proline and soluble carbohydrates, and increased the levels of antioxidants. A total of 4,424 differentially expressed genes were responsive to cold, including 3,075 cold-induced and 1,349 cold-repressed genes. When cold stress was prolonged, there was an increase in the expression of cold-responsive genes coding for transporters, responses to stimuli and stress, regulation of defense response, as well as genes related to signal transduction of all phytohormones. Candidate genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway were identified, eight of which were significantly involved in the cold stress response. Gene expression analyses using qRT-PCR showed a peak in the accumulation of <italic>SaCBF2</italic> to <italic>4</italic>, 50-fold more than control leaves and roots following 12&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h of cold stress, respectively. The CBF-dependent pathway may play a crucial role in increasing cold tolerance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Low temperature is one of the major abiotic factors that impedes plant growth and limits crop yield and geographical distribution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Plants have evolved several adaptive mechanisms to cope with cold stress to protect them against damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. A diverse range of plant species can withstand cold stress to varying degrees, but this depends on reprogramming gene expression to adjust their metabolism and developmental programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Not all plants are able to tolerate low nonfreezing temperatures while temperate plants can adapt to a cold environment and increase their cold tolerance in response to low temperatures, such as Arabidopsis, winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.), among others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. By contrast, plants of tropical and subtropical origin generally have little tolerance to low temperatures and exhibit various symptoms of chilling injury, such as maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, cassava (<italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> Merr.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism of cold stress in plants has been extensively studied over the last 20 years but the complete mechanisms by which plants perceive low temperatures still remain unknown. Research has shown that cold stress tolerance involves the remodeling of cell structures and reprogramming gene expression by triggering a series of protective mechanisms against cold damage, including an increase in the level of intracellular solutes, the accumulation of cryoprotectants and antioxidants, as well as the induction of antifreeze proteins and cold-regulated (COR) proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. During cold stress, these metabolites and proteins help to protect plant membranes and prevent cell disruption by stabilizing membrane lipids, maintaining ion homeostasis and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying cold stress tolerance have been investigated in the model plant Arabidopsis, as well as in other crop species such as maize, wheat and barley<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Plants have developed C-repeat (CRT)-binding factor/dehydration-responsive element binding factor (CBF/DREB)-dependent and CBF/DREB-independent pathways, allowing them to adapt to cold stress. The most extensively studied mechanism of the response to cold has focused on the CBF/DREB-mediated transcriptional regulatory cascade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Recently, it was revealed that the number of genes (about 100) induced by <italic>CBF</italic> genes only accounted for a small percentage of <italic>COR</italic> genes in freezing tolerance while other cold-induced genes showed expression patterns similar to those of <italic>CBF</italic>s in Arabidopsis, such as <italic>ZAT12 (C2H2</italic>-<italic>type zinc finger</italic>), <italic>RAV1 (related to ABI3</italic>/<italic>VP1</italic>), and <italic>MYB73</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

In addition, signaling molecules such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, protein kinase, ROS, and hormones (auxin, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin (GA)) play important roles in cold-induced gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p><italic>Santalum album</italic> L., commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is the best known economically important member of the Santalaceae, and is highly valued for its aromatic heartwood that contains sandal oil, which has various applications in cosmetics, religion and medicine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

As the price for the heartwood of <italic>S. album</italic> has increased at an average rate of more than 50% per year over the past two decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, natural populations have been heavily exploited and thus wild populations are vulnerable to extinction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. <italic>S. album</italic> is now cultivated in South China, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Northern Australia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. This species was first introduced to South China Botanical Garden (SCBG) in 1970 and its cultivation was then limited to Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces, which have a subtropical climate. Every year, these regions experience extremely low temperatures (&#x0003c;&#x02212;2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) in January. A statistical survey showed that these trees grow safely above &#x02212;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C throughout winter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. However, little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that underlie the cold stress response in <italic>S. album</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we completed the in-depth transcriptome sequencing of leaf tissues of <italic>S. album</italic> seedlings. Comprehensive and dynamic changes in the leaves in response to cold stress were monitored using physiological and RNA-seq analyses. Genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were identified from the transcriptome data. Eight genes were differentially expressed by cold stress. We further investigated the TFs involved in regulating the response of sandalwood to cold stress using transcriptome data combined with RACE and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). This study presents the first global transcriptomic overview of the genes involved in the cold stress response in sandalwood. Our findings lay a solid foundation for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this tree&#x02019;s response to cold stress.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Morphological and physiochemical changes of <italic>S. album</italic> in response to cold stress</title><p>Sandalwood seedlings displayed no obvious morphological alterations prior to 24&#x02009;h of cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), but young leaves began to wilt as cold treatment was prolonged from 24 to 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>&#x02013;f). The terminal shoots of seedlings recovered within 48&#x02009;h after being returned to normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and electrolyte leakage (EL) are generally used as direct stress markers to reflect membrane damage by cold stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In this study, MDA content showed no significant change at 12&#x02009;h (relative to the control) and a slight increase at 24&#x02009;h after cold treatment, but peaked at 48&#x02009;h with a 1.77-fold higher change than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). EL decreased slightly at 12&#x02009;h, increased dramatically at 24&#x02009;h, then decreased after 48&#x02009;h of cold stress. The content of proline, a well-known osmoprotectant, showed no significant difference at 12&#x02009;h compared to the control, but increased rapidly and peaked at 24&#x02009;h, then decreased slightly after 48&#x02009;h of cold stress. These results strongly suggest that the cold-stressed sandalwood seedlings actively mounted a stress response after they were exposed to 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Moreover, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) showed continuously increasing trends, with approximately two-fold higher levels than the control at 48&#x02009;h, implying that these ROS-scavenging enzymes were involved in the detoxification of ROS induced by cold. The total soluble carbohydrate content increased at 12&#x02009;h, but did not change significantly after 24 and 48&#x02009;h of exposure to cold.</p><p>The dynamic net photosynthetic rate (A), H<sub>2</sub>O stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (E), intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Ci), and respiration rate (R) of leaves were further monitored during cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The level of A decreased sharply at 12&#x02009;h after exposure to cold and declined gradually from 12 to 24&#x02009;h, but reached a minus value at 48&#x02009;h. Both Gs and E showed a similar trend as A. A stable level of Ci was sustained from 0 to 24&#x02009;h, but increased sharply by 60&#x02013;80% at 48&#x02009;h. It is likely that the rapid decline in A caused much CO<sub>2</sub> to fill the intercellular spaces. Water-use efficiency (WUE) was higher at 12 and 24&#x02009;h compared to the control, implying that an increase in WUE occurred in response to moderate water deficits caused by cold. However, WUE became sharply minus after 48&#x02009;h of cold stress, indicating that plants suffered from severe cold stress. R decreased gradually from 0 to 48&#x02009;h.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome reference sequence and mapping of stress-induced transcriptome sequences from sandalwood leaves</title><p>In total, 97,349,766 clean reads out of 100,445,724 raw reads (GenBank Accession: SRR3731808, SRR3731809) were obtained from <italic>S. album</italic> leaves after adapter trimming and low quality trimming. <italic>De novo</italic> sequences were assembled to yield the <italic>S. album</italic> Gene Index Version 2 (SaGI02) with a total of 135,938 non-redundant unigenes, having an average size of 1203&#x02009;bp and an N50 value of 2253 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). The length distributions of unigenes revealed that more than 60,507 unigenes (44.51%) were greater than 1000&#x02009;bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). A total of 80,426 sequences (59.16%) were annotated as homologs against the NCBI non-redundant protein (Nr) database, Swiss-Prot, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), eukaryotic orthologous groups (COG) and GO databases with a cut-off E-value of &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. For the E-value distribution, more than half of the homologous sequences (50.5%) had a threshold E-value less than 1.0E<sup>&#x02212;60</sup> that showed strong homology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a</xref>). The similarity distributions showed that 68.9% of sequences had more than 60% similarity with sequences within the Nr database, while 31.1% of matches had lower similarity that ranged from 17% to 60% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2b</xref>). The species that provided the best BLASTx match was <italic>V. vinifera</italic>, which showed 52.7% homology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2c</xref>).</p><p>To gain a dynamic view of the gene profiles regulated by cold stress, we further performed RNA-seq analysis of non-cold-treated leaves (0&#x02009;h) and cold-treated leaves at 12, 24, and 48&#x02009;h using three biological replicates. A total of 12 libraries that were constructed were subjected to the Illumina sequencing platform. The sequenced raw reads have been submitted to the SRA at NCBI with the following accession numbers: SRR3490434, SRR3490436, SRR3490438 through to SRR3490442, SRR3490480, SRR3490561, SRR3490688, SRR3490711, and SRR3490712. After filtering out low-quality data (tags containing unknown base N and only adaptor tags), the clean reads of all 12 libraries accounted for more than 99.9% of raw reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Approximately 89.87&#x02013;91.45% of reads in the 12 libraries were mapped to SaGI02, suggesting that the transcriptome was a reliable reference, in which approximately 72.24&#x02013;74.14% of reads were perfectly matched (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Correlation analysis of samples and expression pattern of differentially expressed genes under cold treatment</title><p>The global abundance of gene expression showed that most transcripts were activated by cold, in which the number of genes with FPKM, i.e. <underline>F</underline>ragments <underline>P</underline>er <underline>K</underline>ilobase of transcript per <underline>M</underline>illion mapped reads, ranging from 1 to 10 was most abundant, as assessed by box plot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The square of Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) was greater than 0.92 among the three biological replicates at each time point, indicating both operational stability and the reliability of the experimental results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). Principal component analysis showed that the expression levels between all biological replicates at each time point were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These data suggest that alterations in quantitative expression could be estimated by statistical analysis of this dataset. A total of 4,424 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as being cold responsive over 48&#x02009;h of cold stress, including 3,075 cold-inducible and 1,349 cold-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). A heat map representing the transcript levels for these transcripts at 0, 12, 24 and 48&#x02009;h showed that these transcripts could be divided into eight clusters based on the modulation of their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). Most genes in cluster 2 were rapidly up-regulated at 12&#x02009;h, but were down-regulated 24 and 48&#x02009;h post cold treatment, indicating that these transcripts were transiently expressed by cold. Clusters 4, 6 and 8 showed similar patterns of changes in transcript, with an increase in expression at 12, 24, and 48&#x02009;h compared to the control.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes</title><p>In order to identify the biological functions associated with the cold stress response in sandalwood leaves, pairwise gene set enrichment analyses using a hypergeometric test were performed to search for over- and under-represented GO terms (0 vs 12&#x02009;h/24&#x02009;h/48&#x02009;h). The datasets of three time points in comparison with the control yielded many significant over-represented GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, there were seven over-represented GO terms in all three pair-wise comparisons. Some overlapping and unique GO terms were observed at different time points, suggesting that a dynamic response occurred over the time course of cold stress. Prior to 24&#x02009;h of cold stress, GO terms enriched in up-regulated transcripts were associated with plasma membrane transporters, cell wall reconstruction, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). GO-terms for down-regulated transcripts included water transport, malate metabolism, and regulation of ROS metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Many underlying genes involved in membrane transporters, calcium signaling and protein kinases that were induced by cold stress are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S6</xref>. These results suggest that the cell membrane, cell homeostasis, and calcium signaling play important roles in the early response to cold stress. GO terms related to flavonoid biosynthetic, ketone biosynthetic, and phenylpropanoid metabolic processes indicate that these secondary metabolites might be an integral part of sandalwood&#x02019;s adaptation to cold stress. Interestingly, 36 over-represented GO terms were significantly enriched at 48&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Among these, GO terms related to the response to endogenous stimuli, osmotic stress, hormones, and regulation of the defense response, were most dominant. The most notable are the enrichment of GO-terms related to the response to indole butyric acid or brassinosteroid (BR) stimulus, auxin polar transport, GA catabolism and the GA- or BR-mediated signaling pathway, as well as jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis. A number of DEGs related to hormones were found in the list of DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7</xref>). These suggest that trends in the expression of genes regulating cold response-related processes are enhanced as cold treatment proceeds, allowing sandalwood plants to adapt to environmental variations in which phytohormones play an important role. Based on this assessment, the transcriptomic data was divided into two groups, representing early (12, 24&#x02009;h) and late (48&#x02009;h) responses in <italic>S. album</italic>.</p><p>According to the KEGG function annotations, a total of 12, 22, and 10 pathways that were significantly enriched (Qvalue&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) were identified at 12&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h, 24&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h, and 48&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).

DEGs associated with membrane damage and cell construction were significantly enriched, including those involved in linoleic acid and fatty acid metabolism, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and other processes. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>, a number of genes in the &#x0201c;plant hormone signal transduction&#x0201d; pathway changed significantly.

Genes in clusters 2, 3, and 8 were persistently up-regulated, the majority of which were induced by cold, whereas the expression of genes in cluster 4 was down-regulated. Interestingly, genes in clusters 1 and 6 were down-regulated at 12&#x02009;h, but were once again induced at 24&#x02009;h. These results indicate that diverse activation and repression of gene expression is associated with the photosynthesis of sandalwood plants exposed to cold treatment.</p><p>Among these DEGs, 23 out of the 32 induced transcripts were annotated as malate dehydrogenases (NADP-MDHs), implying that carbon dioxide fixation might be enhanced under cold treatment. Genes coding for electron transporters of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), PSI P700 chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> apoprotein A2 (PsaB) and PSII CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein (PabB), and oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 2 (OEE2), a key protein of the photosynthetic light reaction in PSII, were induced by cold. Several genes encoding phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), which is involved in the light-responsive transcriptional network, accumulated persistently. In contrast, two light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> binding (LHCB) protein-coding genes declined sharply at 12&#x02009;h, but accumulated significantly at 24&#x02009;h and 48&#x02009;h. Taken together, these results suggest that photoprotection, to some extent, increased in response to cold damage. In contrast, the expression of genes annotated as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPE), was persistently down-regulated, suggesting that carbohydrate metabolism had weakened during cold stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Response of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis under cold treatment</title><p>All terpenoids are synthesized through two independent pathways: the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and the plastidial methyerythriol phosphate (MEP) pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.

This gene had log2Ratio &#x0003e;10 values in treated leaves than in the control (CL5305.Contig8). More importantly, of the 41 transcripts encoding terpenoid synthases, seven genes were differentially expressed, including five up-regulated and two down-regulated by cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p><p>The full lengths of these seven genes besides one <italic>HMG</italic>-<italic>CoA</italic> were obtained by RACE.

The expression patterns obtained by qPCR in leaves were in agreement with those inferred by the RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). One gene encoding (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene/(<italic>E</italic>,<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b1;-farnesene synthase (BOS/AFS) was persistently induced in leaves, but increased slowly in roots in response to cold stress. Strikingly, three genes annotated as santalene/bergamotene synthase 1 (SS/BS), SaMonoTPS1, and SaCYP76F38 were repressed in leaves, but significantly up-regulated in roots in response to cold stress, suggesting that organ-specific terpenes might be involved in the response of <italic>S. album</italic> to cold stress.

Following cluster analysis, these TFs were clustered into four groups, i.e., G1, G2, G3, and G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Strikingly, most of these TFs were up-regulated in the three pairwise comparisons, as shown in G2, G3, and G4, revealing that transcriptional activation, but not repression, was significantly involved in the cold stress response. DEGs in the AP2/ERF family were the most abundant. Of these, transcripts of three genes coding for an AP2 domain class TF, one for CBF4, and two for ethylene-responsive TFs, increased dramatically at 12&#x02009;h and decreased gradually until 48&#x02009;h of cold stress, suggesting that these TFs might play crucial roles in the early cold response. One zinc finger CCCH domain protein-coding transcript accumulated significantly, with a similar expression pattern as the AP2 domain class of TFs described above. Members of <italic>MYB, bHLH</italic> (basic helix-loop-helix), <italic>WRKY, NAC</italic> (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2), and <italic>bZIP</italic> families of TFs exhibited cold-inducible expression. Furthermore, a decline in the transcripts of developmental regulators was observed, including GRAS and NFY.</p><p>The full lengths of nine genes were obtained by RACE. Homology searches showed that these nine proteins are members of the AP/ERF domain and ANK superfamilies, and the bHLH family. Based on sequence similarities via BLAST in NCBI, these genes were designated as <italic>SaCBF1, SaCBF2, SaCBF3, SaCBF4, SaERF017, SaERF109</italic>-<italic>like, SaRAP2</italic>.<italic>4, SaC3H29</italic>, and <italic>SaICE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S11</xref>). The full-length sequences of <italic>SaCBF1</italic> encode small proteins 215 amino acids long while SaCBF2 to 4 contain 220 amino acids. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of <italic>Sa</italic>CBF1 to 4 with those of grape CBF1 to 4, poplar CBF1 to 4, and Arabidopsis CBF1 to 4 demonstrated significant similarities in the AP2/ERF binding domain and the CBF signature sequences between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). This result suggests that sandalwood CBFs share remarkable similarities at the amino acid sequence level with known CBF/DREB proteins in other plants and carry critical amino acids that are needed for binding to the CRT elements in the target genes. A phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequences of the four sandalwood <italic>CBF</italic> genes with Arabidopsis CBF1 to 4 proteins, poplar CBF1 to 4 proteins, and grape CBF1 to 4 proteins showed that sandalwood CBF2 and 4 were closely grouped, whereas SaCBF1 was more closely related to poplar CBF1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>).</p><p>The expression patterns of genes in leaves obtained by qPCR were in agreement with those inferred by the RNA-seq data, which further confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq dataset.

However, transcripts of <italic>SaCBF2</italic> to <italic>4</italic> accumulated dramatically at 12&#x02009;h in leaves, with a more than 50-fold increase compared to the control. Similarly, the expression levels of <italic>SaCBF 2</italic> to <italic>4</italic> peaked in roots at 24&#x02009;h of cold treatment, suggesting that leaves were more susceptible to cold stress than roots. It is likely that leaves were directly exposed to cold air and responded quickly to cold stress more than roots, which were immersed in, and thus somewhat protected by, soil. The expression of <italic>SaERF017, SaERF109</italic>-<italic>like, SaRAP2</italic>.<italic>4, SaC3H29</italic>, and <italic>SaICE1</italic> exhibited similar expression patterns as <italic>SaCBF</italic>s over the 48-h time series of cold stress, but the relative expression ratios of these TFs were less than 10.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Novel genes induced by cold stress in <italic>S. album</italic> leaves</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>, approximately 51% genes of all DEGs were found to not have any annotation (<italic>ca</italic>. 2000 genes) or to only have an Nr annotation (250 genes). These were considered to be novel genes in response to cold stress. Of these, about 80% genes were activated by cold. A Venn diagram showed that 894, 778, and 883 novel genes were induced at 12, 24, and 48&#x02009;h of cold treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6a</xref>). Moreover, 184 genes were commonly expressed at all three time points compared with 0&#x02009;h. Notably, there were 442, 284, and 485 genes that were uniquely induced at 12&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h, 24&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h, and 48&#x02009;h/0&#x02009;h, implying that these genes might play important roles at different time points of cold stress. These novel genes could be divided into 27 clusters, and clusters 1 to 8 were significantly different, showing <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6b</xref>). The expression profile of genes in these significant clusters showed that some genes accumulated persistently throughout the 48-h period of cold stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6ci</xref>,ii). In contrast, genes were activated at 12&#x02009;h, but were then completely repressed as the cold stress period was lengthened to 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6ciii</xref>&#x02013;v).

This work will provide an important public genomic resource and facilitate further functional genomic studies of this essential oil-bearing plant.</p><p>Although plants are exposed to fluctuating external temperatures, they can enhance their cold tolerance by modulating gene induction and transcription in response to cold stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. A total of 3075 cold-inducible and 1349 cold-repressed genes were identified in the present study. This predominance of gene induction during cold stress indicates a continuous adaptation over an extended period of time. More than 50% of the <italic>S. album</italic> DEGs had no annotated homologs in the Nr database and these may represent cold-responsive genes with homologs that have not been identified in previous studies with other plants or that are specific to <italic>S. album</italic>. Further research of these genes may reveal new mechanisms of cold-stress responses for <italic>S. album</italic> plants. In addition, many metabolites that contribute to the induction of stress tolerance have long been linked to stress responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. An increase in the contents of MDA, proline and soluble sugars, as well as EL have been demonstrated in cold-tolerant plants such as <italic>Vitis amurensis</italic> Rupr., wheat, and wild tomato<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>S. album</italic> have the ability to withstand the stress of short-period when exposed to cold.</p><p>All aspects of photosynthesis including the light reactions, the Calvin cycle, and photorespiration can be affected by low temperature stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The cessation of growth resulting from cold stress reduces the capacity for energy utilization and causes feedback inhibition of photosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In the present study, significant GO terms for &#x0201c;malate metabolic process&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;carbon utilization&#x0201d; appeared in the early response but were not detected in the late response to cold stress. Although photo-protection was activated during cold stress, cold-induced photo-inhibition finally occurred as the period of cold treatment was prolonged, as confirmed by our physiological analysis. This supports the fact that photosynthetic efficiency is negatively affected by cold stress. ROS accumulation is connected to decreased photosynthetic efficiency, and is caused by a failure in the electron transfer reaction of PSI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The enzymatic antioxidant system is one of the protective mechanisms employed to eliminate or reduce ROS and increase a plant&#x02019;s capacity for stress tolerance under abiotic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Increased SOD and POD activity was detected in our study. The significant enrichment of GO terms related to increased expression of cold-responsive genes, including a response to oxygen-containing compounds or alcohol, and regulation of a plant-type hypersensitive response, were found in the early and late cold responses. This indicates that a dynamic balance in ROS formation and removal from cells to protect them against oxidative damage occurred during cold stress. Moreover, evidence in Arabidopsis showed that flavonoids as antioxidants in photo-protection played important roles in freezing tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Our identification of robust GO terms related to flavonoid biosynthesis implied that flavonoids might be involved in reducing the oxidative damage caused by cold stress. Importantly, the GO terms of up-regulated transcripts related to &#x0201c;response to wounding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;regulation of defense&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;regulation of immune response&#x0201d; were detected in the late cold response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that <italic>S. album</italic> plants recruit a defense mechanism to increase cold tolerance when exposed to a prolonged period of cold.</p><p>Terpenes are a very large and structurally diverse group of secondary metabolites which are widely distributed in the plant kingdom<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Terpene biosynthesis in plants is of great interest because terpenoids play important roles in enhancing biotic or abiotic stress tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Research suggested that plants might enhance their tolerance to environmental stress (drought, high light intensity or high temperature) by increasing the emission of isoprenes or monoterpenes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Evidence showed that sesquiterpenes, (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-farnesene and (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b1;-bergamotene quench ozone but could not protect wild <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> Torr. ex S.

Previous studies and our study indicate that transcripts generating terpenoids were expressed in multiple tissues of sandalwood, including leaves, heartwood, and roots. However, the molecular regulation of santalol biosynthesis in sandalwood is largely unknown. A foliar application of methyl jasmonate caused a higher expression level of <italic>HMGR</italic> and the farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene in leaves and stems of treated <italic>S. album</italic> seedlings compared to untreated plants at 4&#x02009;h, but expression of <italic>cytochrome P450</italic> showed no change in both leaves and stems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In the present study, several homologs of <italic>HMGR</italic> were dramatically up-regulated in leaves by cold stress, implying that this key rate-limiting enzyme in MVA is likely to play an important role in the response of <italic>S. album</italic> to external stress. To date, all terpenes that have shown enhanced abiotic stress tolerance were synthesized in plastids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Under stress, photosynthetic efficiency is closely associated with the accumulation of ROS which constrains the electron transfer reaction of PSI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. As evidenced in our study, cold stress led to a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency in <italic>S. album</italic>. We speculate that these putative terpene synthase genes may play a role in protection against localized oxidative stress in plastids. A sesquiterpene-rich essential oil is very abundant in the heartwood and roots of sandalwood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. High-level accumulation of <italic>SS</italic>/<italic>BS, SaMonoTPS1</italic>, and <italic>SaCYP76F38</italic> in sandalwood roots implies that these genes play a role in protecting sandalwood from cold stress damage. In contrast, high expression of <italic>BOS</italic>/<italic>AFS</italic> in leaves was detected, suggesting that there is likely a different protection mechanism in different organs of <italic>S. album</italic> under cold stress. Functional roles for terpene synthase genes need to be further investigated in <italic>S. album</italic>.</p><p>Research in recent years has indicated that hormones play important roles in regulating plant freezing tolerance by either CBF-dependent or -independent pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

What most deserves to be mentioned is the role of GA in response to cold stress.

However, Park <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> thought that the increase in freezing tolerance that occurs with cold acclimation is only partially dependent on the CBF-CRT/DRE regulatory module in Arabidopsis.

This study demonstrated that <italic>SaCBF2</italic> to <italic>4</italic> was strongly responsive to cold stress in the leaves and roots of sandalwood, although the expression patterns of other TFs, <italic>SaERF017, SaERF109</italic>-<italic>like, SaRAP2</italic>.<italic>4</italic>, and <italic>SaC3H29</italic> were similar to those of <italic>SaCBF</italic>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S9</xref>).

Based on the comprehensive physiological and transcriptomic analyses, when combined with RACE and qRT-PCR, our study provides fundamental knowledge related to the physiological changes and gene regulatory networks that operate when a sandalwood seedling is exposed to cold treatment. After a seedling perceives low temperature through cell membrane receptors, cold signal transduction induces changes to cellular metabolism, including calcium influx, the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase cascades, the accumulation of cryoprotectants, proline, soluble sugar, and the antioxidants SOD and POD. Photosynthetic efficiency is negatively affected by cold stress. Terpenoid synthase genes were also involved in the cold stress response. Phytohormones play important roles in the response to cold stress, although further validation is required. The CBF-dependent signaling pathway might play a crucial role in the regulation of cold tolerance in sandalwood. Thus, a hypothetical model for sandalwood cold response networks has been proposed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S7</xref>). The functions of candidate genes involved in the regulation of cold signaling and cold-resistance genes will be verified in the future. This study contributes to uncovering the molecular background of <italic>S. album</italic>&#x02019;s defense response to cold stress that will allow for the planting area to be expanded and for improving the cold tolerance of sandalwood by genetic engineering. Moreover, the finding that terpene synthase genes are induced by cold stress provides a clue as to how to stimulate santalol biosynthesis and accumulate essential oil in this species.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant material</title><p>Fully ripe <italic>S. album</italic> seeds collected from 20-year-old trees growing in SCBG were germinated according to our previously described method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.
