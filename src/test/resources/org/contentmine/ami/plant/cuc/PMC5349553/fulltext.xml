Recently, OsFD2, a homologue of OsFD1 was proposed to control leaf development through interaction with the same components of a FAC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and this supports the notion that distinct transcription factors may confer the formation of various FAC-like complexes to control programs in plant growth and development.</p><p>Hd3a and RFT1 are two florigen genes in rice.

Besides promoting flowering, FT homologues are known to play various roles in plant developmental processes although it remains unknown whether formation of FAC-like complexes is necessarily required for their function.

Eight isoforms of GF14 are available in rice and six of them are expressed in the shoot apex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

We also found that transgenic rice overexpressing <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> exhibited dwarfism with reduced organ size without significant alteration of flowering time. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing <italic>AtFD</italic> also showed reduced body size as well as early flowering. Both AtFD and AtFDP are able to interact with two rice florigenic proteins, Hd3a and RFT1 in yeast and rice protoplast systems. Transgenic dwarf rice caused by <italic>AtFD</italic>/<italic>AtFDP</italic> overexpression showed reduced expression of genes involved in cell elongation but still responded to gibberellin (GA<sub>3</sub>). Candidate rice genes affected by <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> which are likely responsible for the phenotypes were identified. The majority of these candidate genes were found to encode various types of kinases. In view of these results we propose that <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> likely influence cell elongation or proliferation through GA biosynthesis control and/or various phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction cascades in rice although it is not clear whether the action of AtFD and/or AtFDP is mediated by the FAC-like complex formation or not. Functional evaluation of the candidate genes identified will be the next step for their potential use in manipulation of crop architecture.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FD and FDP interact with Hd3a and RFT1</title><p>To test whether <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FD and FDP are able to interact with rice Hd3a or RFT1, rice FT homologues, we utilized yeast two-hybrid systems and got positive results for Hd3a, RFT1, AtFD and AtFDP. First, AtFD and AtFDP proteins were co-localized with Hd3a and RFT1 in the nucleus of rice protoplasts derived from mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Although all the bZIP domain proteins, AtFD, AtFDP and rice OsFD1 interacted with phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) family proteins including AtFT, Hd3a, RICE CENTRORADIALIS1 (RCN1) and RCN2 in the yeast systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), MBP pull-down assays demonstrated that Hd3a does not interact directly with the bZIP proteins such as AtFD, AtFDP and OsFD1. AtFT, however, was able interact with the bZIP proteins in the same system when the MBP:Hd3a was used as a bait protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This result implies a molecular discrepancy between AtFT and Hd3a in terms of interaction with other proteins including bZIP domain proteins. In the case of Hd3a-OsFD1 interaction, for example, eukaryotic-specific 14-3-3 proteins are required<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and in eukaryotic cells including yeast and plant cells those proteins are believed to act as mediators for the Hd3a-OsFD1 interaction. The phenotypes of transgenic rice plants overexpressing <italic>AtFT</italic> and <italic>Hd3a</italic> were also obviously different: rice plants overexpressing <italic>Hd3a</italic> produced panicles from the callus during tissue culture period whereas none of the transgenic rice overexpressing <italic>AtFT</italic> exhibited such extreme early flowering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Results of BiFC <italic>in vivo</italic> assays using rice protoplasts also supported the AtFD/AtFDP-Hd3a and AtFD/AtFDP-RFT1 interactions, although it is unclear whether 14-3-3s are associated for the interactions in the rice cell. Yellow florescence from the reconstructed YFP was observed in the nucleus of rice protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overexpression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> produces sheathed panicles with reduced height in rice</title><p>Since AtFD and AtFDP interact with Hd3a and RFT1, the effect of AtFD and AtFDP on rice development was investigated by transgenic approaches. Expression level of each transgene was investigated by RT-PCR using total RNA extracts from leaves of each transgenic rice plant. Compared with the wild-type control, TNG67, transgenic rice plants containing p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic> or p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic> construct showed reduced plant height and grain size without significant alteration in heading date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Of particular note, sheathed panicles resulted in reduced fertility and consequently caused loss of yield. Measuring node numbers and the length of internodes in each transgenic plant revealed that the elongation of lower internodes was severely retarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Smaller size spikelets and grains were also observed in the transgenic rice plants indicating that overexpression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and/or <italic>AtFDP</italic> may affect cell elongation during rice development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Notably, transcripts of <italic>OsMADS14</italic> and <italic>OsMADS15</italic> were accumulated in the leaves but not in the stems of transgenic plants although no significant changes in heading date were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Simultaneous overexpression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> enhanced the phenotypes observed in p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic> or p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic> transgenic rice plants</title><p>To investigate whether <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> act in an additive manner in rice, a genetic construct for simultaneous expression of the two genes, <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> was generated and introduced into rice plants through <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation methods. The insertion of the construct into the rice genome was confirmed by genomic PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>) and the simultaneous expression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> in the leaves of each transgenic plant was also verified by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The transgenic plants exhibited dwarfism with severe reduction in grain size; lower internodes, in particular, showed heavily retarded elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) and the size of epidermal cells in the stem was also reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). However, the transgenic plants responded to gibberellin (GA<sub>3</sub>) in cell elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). The size of spikelets and the epidermal cells of floral organs such as palea were smaller than those of control wild-type plants as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). The length and width of grains from the transgenic rice plants were decreased by an average of 22.5% and 19%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). All the panicles were sheathed and fertility was also severely affected; only a few grains were properly matured in each plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Compared with wild-type pollen, the viability as well as the size of pollen from transgenic rice plants was decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Remarkably, the expression of <italic>OsMADS14</italic> and <italic>OsMADS15</italic>, rice <italic>AP1</italic> homologues was up-regulated only in the leaves but not in the stems of <italic>AtFD</italic>-<italic>AtFDP</italic> dual overexpressors controlled by ubiquitin promoter suggesting a distinct effect of <italic>AtFD</italic> and/or <italic>AtFDP</italic> on different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Since mesophyll cells are abundant in the leaves but not in the stems of rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and also phloem-specific expression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and/or <italic>AtFDP</italic> did not show any obvious phenotypes such as dwarfism or the reduced spikelet size shown in <italic>AtFD</italic>/<italic>AtFDP</italic> overexpressors driven by <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promoter, the effect of <italic>AtFD</italic>/<italic>AtFDP</italic> responsible for those phenotypes seems to mainly occur in mesophyll cells. Otherwise, leaf-preferentially expressed <italic>Hd3a</italic>/<italic>RFT1</italic> may be responsible for the induction of <italic>OsMADS14</italic> and <italic>OsMADS15</italic> only in the leaves of <italic>AtFD</italic>/<italic>AtFDP</italic> overexpressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phloem-specific expression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> by the <italic>Hd3a</italic> promoter in rice</title><p><italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> were specifically expressed in the phloem tissue of rice by using <italic>Hd3a</italic> promoter. Expression of the transgenes was checked by RT-PCR using total RNAs extracted from the leaves of each transgenic plant. Unlike transgenic rice plants carrying p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic> and p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic>, transgenic rice plants containing p<italic>Hd3a:AtFD</italic> or p<italic>Hd3a:AtFDP</italic> did not show any significant phenotypic alteration in plant height and grain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). If AtFD and/or AtFDP interact with Hd3a (or RFT1) in rice phloem companion cells, alteration of heading date can be expected by the up-regulation of downstream genes such as <italic>OsMADS15</italic> (early heading) or retardation of Hd3a movement to the shoot apex (delayed heading). However, no significant changes in either heading date or expression of <italic>OsMADS14</italic> and <italic>OsMADS15</italic> were detected in the transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>). To verify the activity of <italic>Hd3a</italic> promoter we used, p<italic>Hd3a:OsFD1</italic> transgenic rice plants were generated.

Total RNAs from the above-ground parts of 50-day-old transgenic plants for p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic>, p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic>, p<italic>Hd3a:AtFD</italic>, p<italic>Hd3a:AtFDP</italic> and p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic>-p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic> together with control TNG67 were extracted for microarray hybridization. By comparison of each microarray hybridization result, we identified eight genes displaying significant changes of expression in plants that showed phenotypes: Os04g40470 (encoding a cytochrome p450 family protein), Os04g56430 (encoding a cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase), Os07g38800 (encoding a lectin-like receptor kinase), Os10g02360 (encoding a wall-associated kinase), Os11g03370 (encoding a NAC-domain containing transcription factor), Os01g01740 (encoding a protein kinase-domain protein), Os03g12730 (encoding a leucine rich repeat-receptor like kinase) and Os09g25784 (encoding a auxin-induced protein 5NG4). First, we selected up-regulated genes in p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic>, p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic> and <italic>AtFD</italic>-<italic>AtFDP</italic> dual overexpressors without significant changes of expression in p<italic>Hd3a:AtFD</italic> and p<italic>Hd3a:AtFDP</italic> compared with WT. Next, among the candidates, we narrowed down genes showing higher levels of expression in <italic>AtFD</italic>-<italic>AtFDP</italic> dual overexpressors, which showed more severe phenotypes than either of the single gene overexpressors. Down-regulated genes were also selected by the same logic. Thus, the first five genes, Os04g40470, Os04g56430, Os07g38800, Os10g02360 and Os11g03370 were picked up as up-regulated genes and the other three genes, Os01g01740, Os03g12730 and Os09g25784 were selected as genes down-regulated by <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> overexpression with phenotypes. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that some genes are similar but others such as Os07g38800, Os10g02360 and Os09g25784 have different expression patterns compared to the results of microarray hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression changes of candidate genes responsible for short stems</title><p>We investigated the expression patterns of each gene identified using different rice organs at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>).

Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts, AtFD and AtFDP are able to interact not only with AtFT but also Hd3a and RFT1. In rice, 14-3-3 proteins are intracellular Hd3a receptors and the Hd3a-OsFD1 interaction is dependent on the existence of 14-3-3 proteins, which are eukaryote-specific in glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. It has also been suggested that the interaction of AtFT with AtFD is indirect, mediated by the 14-3-3 adaptors, with yeast 14-3-3s being able to substitute for plant 14-3-3s in yeast two-hybrid assays for the formation of FAC in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> although no direct evidence is available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Interestingly, however, we observed distinct interaction profiles between Hd3a and AtFT with different bZIP proteins in the MBP pull-down assays. We observed positive interactions between AtFT and bZIP proteins under the same conditions as for the negative interaction between Hd3a and OsFD1, which mirrors published results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> implying molecular discrepancy between the two proteins, AtFT and Hd3a.

Indeed, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> expressing <italic>AtFD</italic> under the control of mesophyll cell-specific <italic>CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING</italic> PROTEIN 3 (<italic>CAB3</italic>) promoter exhibit reduced plant body size with dwarfism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). Remarkably, overexpressors of <italic>OsbZIP23</italic> and <italic>OsbZIP72</italic> encoding proteins interacting with Hd3a, RFT1 and GF14c were indistinguishable from wild-type rice implying that the phenotypes driven by <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> overexpression are gene-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). A recent report showing an early heading of transgenic rice plants (TNG67 cultivar) containing p<italic>Ubi:PaFD</italic>, an <italic>AtFD</italic> homologue of <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic> orchid also support this notion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Of note, the reduced spikelet size of p<italic>Ubi:OsFD1</italic> or p<italic>Ubi:OsFD1</italic>(S192E) plants indicates that smaller spikelet size is not linked to heading date because there is a significant difference in heading date between p<italic>Ubi:OsFD1</italic> and p<italic>Ubi:OsFD1</italic>(S192E) transgenic rice plants although the effect of <italic>OsFD1</italic> on rice height is unknown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. If the action of AtFD and/or AtFDP introduced into rice is through the formation of FAC-like complexes, it would be worthwhile checking whether GF14s are available in phloem companion cells since no phenotypic alterations were observed in transgenic plants expressing <italic>AtFD</italic> or <italic>AtFDP</italic> in the phloem companion cells. Even though there were no significant changes in heading date, notably, the expression of <italic>OsMADS14</italic> and <italic>OsMADS15</italic> was increased in the leaves but not in the stems of p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic>, p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic> and p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic>-p<italic>Ubi:AtFDP</italic> double transgenic rice plants indicating that downstream genes affected by <italic>AtFD</italic> and/or <italic>AtFDP</italic> are likely to be distinct based on cell types. Also, retarded stem elongation may influence the heading date of the transgenic plants. In that case, the transition of the shoot apex to the reproductive phase may occur early based on increased expression of two rice <italic>AP1</italic> genes but retarded elongation of stem may compromise the early flowering phenotype since days for panicle emergence are counted as heading date in rice. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that formation of complexes may occur between introduced AtFD/AtFDP and endogenous RCN proteins whose transcripts are preferentially abundant in the vegetative and reproductive meristems. Actually, <italic>RCN1</italic>/<italic>RCN2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic rice plants under the control of <italic>35S</italic> promoter resulted in delayed flowering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p><italic>AtFD</italic> has been reported to be a flowering activator encoding a bZIP transcription factor that interacts with AtFT, with <italic>fd</italic> mutants exhibiting delayed flowering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. However, there has been no report about its possible effect on vegetative tissue or organ development. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Abe <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> demonstrated that p<italic>35S:AtFD</italic> rescued the late flowering of <italic>fd-1</italic>. Although they did not describe the reduced plant size, the complemented mutant was very tiny. We observed such a small sized plants caused by p<italic>35S:AtFD</italic> even in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with a mild early flowering phenotype although phloem-specific <italic>AtFD</italic> expression in <italic>fd</italic>-3 mutant did not exhibit such phenotypes showing similar plant size and flowering time to control plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). These results gained from transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> approaches are similar to the phenotypes we observed in our transgenic rice plants suggesting common effects of <italic>AtFD</italic> or <italic>AtFDP</italic> in mesophyll cells of the two model plant species. In addition, expression of <italic>OsFD1</italic> under the control of shoot apex-specific <italic>AtFD</italic> promoter was able to rescue the late flowering phenotype of <italic>fd-3</italic> without affecting plant size indicating that <italic>OsFD1</italic> can functionally replace the <italic>AtFD</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p>Fukazawa <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> reported that tobacco bZIP-domain protein, REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG) is also implicated in cell elongation linked to active GA biosynthesis. In addition, RSG interacts with 14-3-3 proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, which is similar to several bZIP proteins including wheat EmBP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FD, FDP, rice OsFDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, OsbZIP23 and OsbZIP72 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). BZI-1, another tobacco bZIP protein has been implicated in the fine-tuning of auxin-mediated transcription in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Although several rice bZIP proteins interact with Hd3a or RFT1, it is difficult to anticipate whether all of them play similar roles in plant development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). For example, overexpression of <italic>OsbZIP72</italic>, which is regarded as a positive regulator of ABA response and drought tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, did not cause any dwarfism or reduction in organ size in rice despite its binding pattern being similar to those seen in AtFD, AtFDP and OsFD1 with florigenic proteins and GF14c in yeast systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Since bZIP proteins are also known to form homo and/or heterodimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, ectopic expression of bZIP proteins may induce novel phenotypes by interrupting original interactions and/or formation of <italic>de novo</italic> interactions resulting in transcriptional changes in the cells. Recruitment of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors can also not be excluded in the formation of FT-FD complexes for the downstream gene regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Moreover, distinct FAC-like complexes depending on transcription factors and/or PEBPs may occur to regulate various developmental and physiological processes in plants. OsFD2, a homologue of OsFD1 can be an example of the latter since OsFD2 forms a FAC with Hd3a and 14-3-3 for controlling leaf development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Overexpression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> in rice caused dwarfism with reduced size of the plant body, which is likely due to retarded cell elongation. Indeed, expression of a series of genes involved in cell elongation such as extensins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and expansins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> is reduced in the stems of <italic>AtFD</italic>-<italic>AtFDP</italic> dual overexpressors. In addition, genes that encode cell-wall loosening enzymes necessary for cell elongation such as xyloglucan endotransglycosylase-related (XTR) proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> as well as <italic>OsWRKY78</italic> that encode a transcription factor regulating stem elongation and its putative targets, <italic>OsSBE3</italic> and <italic>ISA1</italic> show reduced expression in the short stems of <italic>AtFD</italic>-<italic>AtFDP</italic> overexpressors compared to WT indicating defective cell elongation in the dual gene overexpressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Reduced expression level of genes encoding expansins, extensins and XTHs is also observed in p<italic>35S:AtFD</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>) demonstrating a common molecular effect of <italic>AtFD</italic> in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Since the transgenic dual overexpressors still respond to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> treatment, phenotypes of dwarfism and small organs are likely linked to impaired GA biosynthesis in plants.</p><p>Candidate rice genes responsible for the phenotypes were identified based on transcriptomic analyses using microarrays. Interestingly, the majority of the candidates were found to encode various types of protein kinases whose expression is influenced by overexpression of <italic>AtFD</italic> and <italic>AtFDP</italic> in rice. It is also known that bZIP proteins such as AtFD and RSG are phosphorylated by calcium-dependent protein kinases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and tobacco<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>The dynamic nature of the plant cell wall allows growing cells to expand. Although multiple receptor-like kinases (RLKs) that likely play a role in regulating cell wall function have been identified, many questions remain unanswered about the downstream signaling targets and effects on plant growth and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Recently, it was reported that rice leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase 1 (LRK1) overexpression increased rice growth by promoting cellular proliferation. One of our candidate genes, Os03g12730 encoding a similar type kinase to LRK1 showed reduced expression in transgenic dwarf plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Moreover, higher expression of Os11g03370 that codes for a NAC transcription factor is observed in transgenic rice containing p<italic>Ubi:AtFD</italic>/<italic>AtFDP</italic> and, recently, it was reported that transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing <italic>OsNAC2</italic> (Os04g38720) caused shorter plant height with shorter spikelets, which may support our results since both NAC transcription factors, Os11g03370 and OsNAC2 belong to the same NAM/CUC3 subgroup of NAC transcription factor family in rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.
