    "Persimmon fruits accumulate a large amount of proanthocyanidins (PAs) during development. PAs cause a dry or puckering sensation due to its astringency. Pollination constant and non-astringent (PCNA) persimmon fruits can lose astringency during fruit ripening. However, little is known about the mechanism of natural de-astringency of Chinese PCNA (CPCNA). To gain insight into the molecular events of CPCNA natural de-astringency, we used mRNA-seq and iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis to measure changes in genes and proteins expression at two key stages of natural astringency removal (i.e. 10 and 20 weeks after bloom) and water-treated (i.e. 40 °C·12 h) de-astringency fruits. Our analyses show that the three predominantly process in CPCNA de-astringency: (1) water treatment strongly up-regulates glycolysis/acetaldehyde metabolism, (2) expression of genes/proteins involved in PA biosynthetic pathway was remarkably reduced in natural and water-treated de-astringency, (3) sugar metabolism and ethylene related pathway were quite abundant in natural de-astringency. We also found ethylene-related TFs were quite abundant in natural de-astringency, followed by WRKY and NAC transcription factors. These results provide an initial understanding of the predominantly biological processes underlying the natural de-astringency and \"coagulation effect\" in CPCNA."
