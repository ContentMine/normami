PAs cause a dry or puckering sensation due to its astringency. Pollination constant and non-astringent (PCNA) persimmon fruits can lose astringency during fruit ripening. However, little is known about the mechanism of natural de-astringency of Chinese PCNA (CPCNA). To gain insight into the molecular events of CPCNA natural de-astringency, we used mRNA-seq and iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis to measure changes in genes and proteins expression at two key stages of natural astringency removal (i.e. 10 and 20 weeks after bloom) and water-treated (i.e. 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x000b7;12&#x02009;h) de-astringency fruits. Our analyses show that the three predominantly process in CPCNA de-astringency: (1) water treatment strongly up-regulates glycolysis/acetaldehyde metabolism, (2) expression of genes/proteins involved in PA biosynthetic pathway was remarkably reduced in natural and water-treated de-astringency, (3) sugar metabolism and ethylene related pathway were quite abundant in natural de-astringency. We also found ethylene-related TFs were quite abundant in natural de-astringency, followed by <italic>WRKY</italic> and <italic>NAC</italic> transcription factors. These results provide an initial understanding of the predominantly biological processes underlying the natural de-astringency and &#x0201c;coagulation effect&#x0201d; in CPCNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Persimmon (<italic>Diospyros kaki</italic> Thunb.; 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6x&#x02009;=&#x02009;90) originated in China and has been widely cultivated in Eastern Asia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Most persimmon fruits accumulate large amounts of high-molecular-weight proanthocyanidins (PAs) in special compartment cells called &#x0201c;tannin cells&#x0201d; that cause a strong astringency sensation in fresh fruits; therefore, these fruits are inedible without artificial treatment to remove the astringency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

This non-astringent mutant phenotype, also called pollination constant and non-astringent (PCNA), includes Japanese PCNA (JPCNA) and Chinese PCNA (CPCNA).

However, the molecular events and primary course of metabolism in natural de-astringency and the relationship between natural and artificial de-astringency are largely unknown. In this study, fruits at the key stages of natural astringency removal (i.e. 10 and 20 WAB) and water-treated no-astringent fruits were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. These transcriptomic and proteomic data were then used to investigate the genes/proteins expression patterns in two different de-astringency processes and to identify statistically robust GO categories and the underlying genes associated with natural astringency removal.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PA accumulation patterns between CPCNA, JPCNA and non-PCNA types</title><p>To examine the PA accumulation patterns in CPCNA fruits, three cultivars, &#x02018;Eshi 1&#x02032; (CPCNA), &#x02018;Youhou&#x02019; (JPCNA) and &#x02018;Mopanshi&#x02019; (non-PCNA), were used for PA seasonal change determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The imprinting method was performed to approximately measure the soluble tannin content in persimmon fruits. It was deeply stained at 2.5 WAB and gradually lightened with fruit development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The stain was lightly at 10 WAB in &#x02018;Youhou&#x02019; and later in &#x02018;Eshi 1&#x02019; (i.e. 20 WAB), while the &#x02018;Mopanshi&#x02019; was darkly stained even at 25 WAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the imprinting results, the soluble and insoluble tannin contents were quantified by the Folin-Ciocalteu method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.

The soluble tannin concentration of JPCNA &#x02018;Youhou&#x02019; decreased to 0.2% at 10 WAB, indicating that the fruits at this point had already lost their astringency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Meanwhile, the soluble tannin concentration was maintained at a high level at the same stage in CPCNA and non-PCNA. In addition, the insoluble tannin concentration showed a slight increase in CPCNA after 10 WAB, but no significant change was observed in JPCNA and non-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The insoluble tanning content sharply increased while soluble tannin decreased after water treatment</title><p>To examine the tannin variation and gene expression changes during artificial de-astringency, the &#x02018;Eshi 1&#x02032; (CPCNA) fruits sampled at 10 WAB were then treated with water (25 and 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) to remove their astringency.

We identified differentially expressed genes and proteins, and characterized the functional characteristics of DEGs and DEPs in two processes of astringency removal that could be further exploited to help understanding the molecular events during CPCNA natural astringency removal.</p><p>Previous reports demonstrated that soluble tannin concentration was markedly reduced in the PCNA type compared with the non-PCNA type at an early stage of fruit development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.

The PA biosynthetic pathway was severely blocked in late stage of fruit development. Many of GO terms of down-regulated genes and proteins in natural de-astringency were related to the PA biosynthesis-related pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S7</xref>).

Thus, the up-regulated <italic>GST-like</italic> genes in this experiment might response to heat stress (i.e. 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C water treatment) or biotic and abiotic stress (i.e. plant hormones). Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR to validate the expression of 11 key structural genes in the three cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The expression of most of these genes, except for that of <italic>LAC_CL3961.Contig1_All</italic>, was simultaneously down-regulated from 2.5 WAB and was almost below the detection limit after 10 WAB in JPCNA and after 15 WAB in CPCNA and non-PCNA, but the average expression levels of these genes were approximately 2- and 11-fold higher in non-PCNA than in CPCNA and JPCNA at 10 WAB, respectively.

This phenomenon is not observed in JPCNA and non-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).

This results suggested that anaerobic condition caused fruits astringency removal, heat treatment only accelerate this process but was not necessary to remove fruits astringency. Both the KEGG pathways and GO enrichment results implied that glycolysis process and pyruvate biosynthesis is significantly enriched in underlying water-treated fruits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B,E</xref>).
