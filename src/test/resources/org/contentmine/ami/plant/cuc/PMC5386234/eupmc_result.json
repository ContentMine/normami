    "Although chimeric repressors such as the Arabidopsis TCP3 repressor are known to have significant effects on flower morphology and color, their cellular-level effects on flower petals are not understood. The promoter sequences of the genes expressed in the flowers of cyclamen, a representative potted flower grown during the winter season, are also unknown. Here, we isolated eight promoters from cyclamen genes that are reportedly expressed in the petals. These promoters were then fused to four chimeric repressors and introduced into the model flower torenia to screen for effective combinations of promoters and repressors for flower breeding. As expected, some of the constructs altered flower phenotypes upon transformation. We further analyzed the effects of chimeric repressors at the cellular level. We observed that complicated petal and leaf serrations were accompanied by excessive vascular branching. Dichromatism in purple anthocyanin was inferred to result in bluish flowers, and imbalanced cell proliferation appeared to result in epinastic flowers. Thus, the genetic constructs and phenotypic changes described in this report will benefit the future breeding and characterization of ornamental flowers."
