The promoter sequences of the genes expressed in the flowers of cyclamen, a representative potted flower grown during the winter season, are also unknown. Here, we isolated eight promoters from cyclamen genes that are reportedly expressed in the petals. These promoters were then fused to four chimeric repressors and introduced into the model flower torenia to screen for effective combinations of promoters and repressors for flower breeding. As expected, some of the constructs altered flower phenotypes upon transformation. We further analyzed the effects of chimeric repressors at the cellular level. We observed that complicated petal and leaf serrations were accompanied by excessive vascular branching. Dichromatism in purple anthocyanin was inferred to result in bluish flowers, and imbalanced cell proliferation appeared to result in epinastic flowers. Thus, the genetic constructs and phenotypic changes described in this report will benefit the future breeding and characterization of ornamental flowers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The breeding of new flower cultivars with various phenotypes, such as different petal colors and shapes, is key to promoting flower use. Straightforward destruction of endogenous genes, introduction of new metabolic pathways from different species through transformation, and random mutagenesis using ion beam irradiation have been effective in generating double flowers as well as altering flower color, pigmentation patterns, and shapes (for example, refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). In addition to these approaches, the use of chimeric repressors to confer different characteristics upon flowers in a dominant genetic manner has also been tested.</p><p>Chimeric repressors are artificially generated by combining transcription activators with peptides known as repression domains. In plants, class II ethylene-responsive element-binding factor and TFIIIA-type zinc finger repressors, including SUPERMAN, share the &#x02018;EAR motif&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Short peptides that include this motif function as repression domains, changing transcription activators into transcription suppressors. The most frequently used and strongest repression domain is &#x02018;SRDX,&#x02019; which is a leucine-rich peptide consisting of 12 amino acid residues (LDLDLELRLGFA). This peptide was obtained by altering the native sequence of the repression domain of SUPERMAN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The wide range of flower phenotypes generated to date using chimeric repressors is listed in the FioreDB database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cres-t.org/fiore/public_db/index.shtml">http://www.cres-t.org/fiore/public_db/index.shtml</ext-link>; refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Due to the ease of transformation compared with other ornamental crops, torenia (<italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> Lind.) is used as a model system for transgenic flower breeding. Various chimeric repressors of Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh.) transcription factors have been surveyed in torenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> According to the comparison of all such chimeric repressors examined in torenia thus far, repressors of <italic>TCP</italic> (<underline>T</underline>eosinte branched1, <underline>C</underline>ycloidea and <underline>P</underline>cf) and <italic>SEP3</italic> (<underline>SEP</underline>allata<underline>3</underline>) are among those causing the clearest phenotypic changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15">12&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Endogenous promoters of torenia have been used to drive the Arabidopsis TCP3 repressor to change torenia flower phenotypes specifically and in various ways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Thus, variation in promoters and chimeric repressors promotes the breeding of a variety of transgenic flowers. However, despite the publication of several relevant reports, the physiological effects of chimeric repressors linked to phenotypic changes in transgenic flowers, such as petal serration, have not been examined in ornamental flowers.</p><p>In the present study, we first isolated promoters from cyclamen (<italic>Cyclamen persicum</italic> Mill.), which is a representative potted winter-flowering plant. We identified eight promoter sequences of genes known to be expressed in cyclamen petals. We then cloned these promoters and used them to drive four different chimeric repressors in torenia. Examination of the transgenic torenia flowers harboring these genetic constructs allowed us to characterize the effects of these cyclamen promoters and chimeric repressors. Further analyses of the transgenic lines suggested morphological or biochemical effects linked to the phenotypic changes in the flowers.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of cyclamen promoters</title><p>The full-length cDNA sequences of <italic>CpAP1</italic>, <italic>CpPI</italic>, <italic>CpAP3A</italic>, <italic>CpAP3B</italic>, <italic>CpSEP2</italic>, <italic>CpSEP3</italic>, <italic>CpFLC</italic>, <italic>CpCHS</italic>, <italic>CpDFR</italic> and <italic>CpOMT</italic> were previously reported (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Three gene-specific primers (GSP1, GSP2 and GSP3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were designed in reverse orientation corresponding to the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) or the first exon of each cDNA sequence, and additional gene-specific primers were designed for some of the genes to extend the promoter sequences. Genomic DNA was extracted from cyclamen (<italic>Cyclamen persicum</italic> Mill. cultivar &#x02018;Mini Loyal Purple&#x02019;) leaves using &#x02018;PVPP buffer&#x02019; containing 4&#x02009;<sc>m</sc> NaCl and was purified via ultracentrifugation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> The promoter sequences were amplified by adaptor PCR with a &#x02018;mismatched DS4 adaptor&#x02019; (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which potentially has a better capability to amplify target sequences.

The first round of PCR was performed with &#x02018;Whole-F1&#x02019; and &#x02018;Whole-R1&#x02019; primers. The first PCR product (diluted 1/1000 in solution) was then amplified using a combination of the &#x02018;Whole-F2&#x02019; primer, individual promoter-specific primers (PSP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and the mixture of all repressor-specific primers (RSP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Both the first and second rounds of PCR were performed with KOD Plus Neo polymerase for 40 cycles, with an annealing temperature of 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and an extension time of 2&#x02009;min. The repressor genes (<italic>AtTCP3-RD</italic>, <italic>CpTCP1B-RD</italic>, <italic>AtSEP3-RD</italic> or <italic>CpSEP3-RD</italic>) introduced into the transformants were finally determined based on the PCR product sizes (approximately 650&#x02009;bp for <italic>CpTCP1B-RD</italic>, 500&#x02009;bp for <italic>CpSEP3-RD</italic>, 400&#x02009;bp for <italic>AtSEP3-RD</italic>, and 200&#x02009;bp for <italic>AtTCP3-RD</italic>). The whole-F2 primer generates large DNA fragments when there is no construct corresponding to the target promoter sequence. Inclusion of the whole-F2 primer in the second PCR is necessary to reduce non-specific amplification. This scheme was repeated for all <italic>CPG</italic> promoters that may have been introduced into the target line. Tetraploid transformants and those transformants harboring multiple constructs were not used for phenotypic analyses.

The observed phenotypic changes in the petals fell into three categories: changes in lobe morphology (e.g., serrated lobes), changes in the yellow coloration of the blotch, and changes in the purple coloration of the limbs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows the phenotypic changes in these categories caused by different combinations of <italic>CPG</italic> promoters and chimeric repressors (<italic>TCP-RD</italic> or <italic>SEP3-RD</italic>). For example, because transgenic lines harboring <italic>CpPI</italic>p-<italic>SEP3-RD</italic> constructs exhibited a blotchless phenotype, they were considered modified in category &#x02018;Y&#x02019; (yellow) but not in categories &#x02018;L&#x02019; (lobes) and &#x02018;P&#x02019; (purple).

In contrast, <italic>CpAP3B</italic>p activity was observed in the whole petal, explaining why this promoter can modify all three phenotypic categories. <italic>CpDFR</italic>p was only weakly active in the limbs, and this promoter specifically modified L-type phenotypes. L-type phenotypes may be modified by TCP repressors more easily compared with P-type phenotypes. No activity of <italic>CpOMT</italic>p was detected in our experiments, and this promoter accordingly did not cause any changes in flower phenotypes. As <italic>CpAP3A</italic>p or <italic>CpSEP2</italic>p also did not cause phenotypic changes, these two promoters may not be active in torenia flowers.</p><p>The observed activity of <italic>CpAP3B</italic>p in the petals and stamens is in accord with its phylogenetic classification as a class-B MADS-box gene, although no phenotypic changes were observed in the stamens in this study.

Outer curling of the lobes (that is, epinasty) is caused by an imbalance in cell proliferation and/or cell expansion between the adaxial (inner) and abaxial (outer) surfaces of the lobes. Microscopic analysis revealed an increased density of conical cells only on the adaxial surface of the <italic>CpDFR</italic>p-<italic>CpTCP1B-RD</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>), indicating that <italic>CpTCP1B-RD</italic> accelerated cell proliferation on the adaxial surface of transgenic plants.

The effects of TCP repressors on serrations can be divided into two categories. First, TCP repressors cause deeper primary serrations. This effect is consistent with the CUC2 (<underline>CU</underline>p-shaped <underline>C</underline>otyledon <underline>2</underline>)-mediated formation and regulation of leaf serrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Indeed, <italic>CUC2</italic> expression is elevated in Arabidopsis plants with mutations in TCP genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Second, TCP repressors generate small secondary serrations in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and possibly in petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The positions of the secondary serrations appear to overlap with the positions at which additional vasculature is formed in transgenic lines. This positive and possibly simultaneous regulation of the formation of secondary serrations and vascular branching should be independent of the CUC2 pathway because CUC2 is known to neither induce secondary serrations nor regulate vascular branching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup></p><p>A mutation in the <italic>FRILL1</italic> gene also causes frilled flowers in Arabidopsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> and the vascular pattern is altered in such flowers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> The frilled phenotype of this mutant is attributed to the differential regulation of endoreduplication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> a phenomenon in which some diploid (2C) cells are converted to tetraploid (4C), octaploid (8C) or hexadecaploid (16C) cells with an enlarged cell size.

However, there is no sign of endoreduplication in diploid torenia leaves; i.e., there is only a single peak corresponding to diploid (2C) cells (Kasajima et al., unpublished). Although we do not have sufficient data to reach a definite conclusion, vascular branching, rather than endoreduplication, may be linked to the serrations observed in torenia.</p><p>Phenotypic changes caused by SEP3 repressors are not necessarily strong, but the reduction of purple coloration may be a sign of the conversion of petals to sepals.

The characteristics of these flowers lie partly in the simple balance of colors, in the absence of a yellow blotch, and in lighter lobe colors. The lobe coloration of these lines also appeared somewhat bluish when directly observed with the naked eye, which was confirmed by colorimetric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Judging from the obtained colorimetric values, the non-transgenic flowers were magenta (red-purple), while the <italic>CpCHS</italic>p-<italic>AtSEP3-RD</italic> flowers were violet (blue-purple) and three times lighter. The purple petal color of torenia is caused by anthocyanins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup></p><p>The color of purple flowers is affected by changes in the spectra of incident light.

The color of purple flowers, including that of purple torenia flowers, becomes bluish under white light-emitting diode (LED) light and reddish under incandescent light due to the colorimetric phenomenon known as the &#x02018;alexandrite effect&#x02019; or &#x02018;color change&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> This may be the principal reason that the color (hue) of a given purple flower appears different between images.</p><p>The observed difference in the hues between the non-transgenic line and the <italic>CpCHS</italic>p-<italic>AtSEP3-RD</italic> line may have been caused by a colorimetric phenomenon other than changes in the chemical structure of anthocyanins. In a previous report, a bluish torenia line (cultivar &#x02018;Crown Violet&#x02019;) was generated by suppressing the <italic>DFR</italic> gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Suppression of the <italic>DFR</italic> gene modified co-pigment accumulation and shifted the spectral pattern of light absorbance to the right (that is, to longer wavelengths).

Although we did not measure anthocyanin concentrations in this study, we deduced that &#x02018;dichromatism&#x02019; causes the hue to change in the presence of different concentrations of purple anthocyanins. Strong red reflectance will cause the flower color to be reddish at high anthocyanin concentrations in the non-transgenic line, whereas intermediate blue reflectance will be enhanced in the presence of lower concentrations of purple anthocyanins in the <italic>CpCHS</italic>p-<italic>AtSEP3-RD</italic> line, causing the flower to become bluish. The exponential relationship between light transmittance and pigment concentrations, as described by the Beer-Lambert law, causes this kind of alteration in the balance between the intensities of different wavelengths at different pigment concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> The concentration and chemical structure of anthocyanins in the petals of <italic>CpCHS</italic>p-<italic>AtSEP3-RD</italic> lines should be examined in the future to obtain further insight into the color of these flowers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we newly isolated 8 promoters of genes expressed in cyclamen petals and prepared 32 constructs.
