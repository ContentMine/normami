However, the metabolic shifts involved in callus formation and shoot regeneration are largely unknown. The metabolic profiles of callus generated from tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) cotyledons and that of shoot regenerated from callus were compared with the <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutant that exhibits enhanced polar auxin transport and the <italic>shr</italic> mutant that exhibits elevated nitric oxide levels. The transformation from cotyledon to callus involved a major shift in metabolite profiles with denser metabolic networks in the callus. In contrast, the transformation from callus to shoot involved minor changes in the networks. The metabolic networks in <italic>pct1-2</italic> and <italic>shr</italic> mutants were distinct from wild type and were rewired with shifts in endogenous hormones and metabolite interactions. The callus formation was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of metabolites involved in cell wall lignification and cellular immunity. On the contrary, the levels of monoamines were upregulated in the callus and regenerated shoot. The callus formation and shoot regeneration were accompanied by an increase in salicylic acid in wild type and mutants. The transformation to the callus and also to the shoot downregulated <italic>LST8</italic> and upregulated <italic>TOR</italic> transcript levels indicating a putative linkage between metabolic shift and TOR signalling pathway. The network analysis indicates that shift in metabolite profiles during callus formation and shoot regeneration is governed by a complex interaction between metabolites and endogenous hormones.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR11671/PBD/16/828/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Rameshwar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR11671/PBD/16/828/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sreelakshmi</surname><given-names>Yellamaraju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, New Delhi (Grant no.

The differentiated mature plant cells can undergo dedifferentiation followed by organogenesis and generation of fully fertile plant. On injury of organs, cells in the vicinity of the injury proliferate to form a mass of soft tissue consisting of pluripotent cells called as callus to seal the injured area. During last three decades, <italic>in vitro</italic> initiation of callus and organogenesis has been used for a plethora of biotechnological applications. Though Haberlandt (1902) [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] proposed the idea of <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing of isolated cells/tissues from higher plants, the successful tissue culture could be established only after supplementation of media with plant hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which was identified few years earlier [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The discovery of another plant hormone cytokinin and realization that the initiation of shoot or root from callus can be induced by alteration of ratios of cytokinin to IAA [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] stimulated regeneration of several plant species using tissue culture. The observation that a single cell from carrot root cells suspension culture can differentiate into a somatic embryo provided conclusive proof that plant cells are totipotent in nature [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, the molecular basis underlying dedifferentiation to callus and also for initiation of organogenesis has been uncovered. Detailed examination of calli initiation in Arabidopsis revealed that incubation of shoot/root explants on auxin rich callus initiating media (CIM) triggers initiation of callus from the pericycle cells in vascular bundles [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Also, the cells constituting calli were not a mass of undifferentiated cells rather had organized structures akin to the primordia of lateral roots [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Even the calli initiated from other organs such as cotyledons and petals showed organized structures similar to lateral root primordia [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The notion that the molecular events leading to calli initiation were similar to initiation of lateral root primordia was supported by the resemblance of transcriptome profiles of calli to that of lateral root primordia [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The suppression of calli initiation in <italic>aberrant lateral root formation4</italic> (<italic>alf4</italic>) mutant also supported that, at least in Arabidopsis, the calli initiation follows a pathway similar to initiation of lateral roots [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The initiation of calli requires reacquisition of mitotic cell division which is stimulated by the exogenous plant hormones. Among hormones, auxin is a well-known inducer of lateral root development. It is reported that during callus initiation auxin activates ARF7 and ARF19 transcription factors that in turn activate LBD transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The induction of cell cycle regulatory E2Fa transcription factor by LBD transcription factor stimulates re-entry into S phase of cell cycle [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since lateral root formation is impeded in <italic>E2Fa</italic> mutant, it supports the operation of ARF-LBD-E2Fa pathway for calli initiation [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In parallel, auxin also stimulates callus induction by downregulation of <italic>KRP</italic> genes relieving inhibition of CDKs stimulating cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Compared to auxin, limited information is available about the role of cytokinin in callus initiation. It is reported that cytokinin may mediate its action by regulating the activity of type-B ARR, AP2/ERF, ESR1, and ESR 2 transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Currently, it is believed that the callus basically has a root identity [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The transfer of callus to cytokinin rich shoot initiation media (SIM) triggers switch from root to shoot identity with induction of shoot-specific genes such as <italic>WUS</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On SIM, calli also show the segregation of gene expression pattern, with auxin-responsive genes being confined to the region not initiating shoot, and cytokinin responsive genes being confined to region initiating shoot [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Also, both calli induction and shoot induction is regulated by changes in the levels of microRNA. In Arabidopsis calli grown on SIM, <italic>MIR160a</italic> levels were more downregulated in totipotent calli than in non-totipotent calli [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is recently reported that the initiation of the calli and regeneration of shoot occurs via a two-step mechanism. In first step <italic>PLETHORA</italic> genes (<italic>PLT3</italic>, <italic>PLT5</italic>, and <italic>PLT7</italic>) control the expression of root stem cell maintenance regulators (<italic>PLT1</italic> and <italic>PLT2</italic>) leading to calli initiation and proliferation. In second step plethora genes (<italic>PLT3</italic>, <italic>PLT5</italic>, and <italic>PLT7</italic>) regulate initiation of shoot regeneration by modulating shoot-promoting factors (CUC2) [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>While the gene regulation is foremost in driving the developmental transitions, these transitions are also coupled with changes in the levels of primary metabolites and phytohormones. Though it is known that exogenously added hormones, partially exert their effect by altering endogenous hormone levels, very few studies investigated alteration in endogenous hormone levels during callus induction and organogenesis. The regeneration ability of pumpkin cotyledons varied depending on the endogenous cytokinin (iPA) content of different aged seedlings [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In rice, exposure to osmotic stress elevates the levels of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and IAA promoting shoot regeneration from callus [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Despite considerable research on the molecular-genetic basis of tissue regeneration, very few reports examined the metabolome profiles and its regulation during callus formation and shoot regeneration. In rice, profiling of callus, leaf, and panicle revealed distinct differences in metabolic profiles of respective tissue [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In sugar cane, leaf-derived embryogenic and non-embryogenic callus showed distinct metabolic profiles with higher levels of sugars such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose in embryogenic calli along with upregulation of few amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In recent years, evidences have also emerged that regulation of cellular metabolism in plants is mediated by TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signalling pathway in a fashion similar to animal and yeast cells [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Arabidopsis TOR interacts with RAPTOR and LST8 homologs to activate ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), a regulator that promotes cell expansion [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Correlation with TOR activity and cellular metabolism has been observed in Arabidopsis <italic>tor</italic> mutant that shows smaller cells and organs similar to the plants growing under limited nutrient availability or low light irradiance [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examined the shift in metabolite profiles during <italic>in vitro</italic> organogenesis in tomato by comparing metabolite and hormonal profiles of cotyledon with callus and regenerated shoots. It is reported that PIN1 protein involved in polar auxin transport plays an important role during early stages of callus initiation displaying upregulation followed by downregulation in the region destined to be shoot progenitor cells [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During shoot regeneration from calli, PIN1 is accumulated in developing shoot meristem and later in organ primordia. Consistent with this shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis <italic>pin1-4</italic> mutant is reduced to 1/5 of wild-type [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In view of above role of PIN1 in calli formation, we compared metabolic shifts with the polycotyledon (<italic>pct1-2</italic>) mutant of tomato that shows enhanced polar auxin transport associated with elevated level of polar auxin transporter PIN1 protein [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulatory molecule participating in a large number of developmental responses in the plants [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In tomato, NO participates in auxin-induced lateral root initiation as a part of signal transduction chain [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Evidences indicate that during tomato lateral root initiation NO modulates cell cycle regulatory genes mediating transition from G<sub>1</sub>-to-S phase [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Considering that callus has identity akin to lateral root primordia, and NO participates in lateral root initiation, we also compared the shifts in metabolite profiles with the shifts in tomato <italic>short root</italic> mutant where shortening of the root is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>We mapped the alteration of metabolites and endogenous hormones on respective metabolic pathways in an attempt to understand modulation of metabolomic homeostasis during callus formation and shoot regeneration. In addition to comparing relative levels of individual metabolites and hormones, we also used the network approach to obtain an integrated view of metabolite-metabolite and hormone-metabolite correlations [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We show that though the metabolic networks in <italic>pct1-2</italic> and <italic>shr</italic> mutants were distinct from wild type, the transition to callusing and organogenesis proceeded normally with shifts in endogenous hormones and metabolite interactions. Our results are discussed in the context of the transformation of cotyledon to callus, and callus to regenerated shoot on metabolite profiles and interaction networks. We also report that callus shows reduced lignification and lowered cellular immunity that may have a bearing on metabolomic homeostasis. In addition, we also report that callus formation and shoot regeneration alter transcript levels of genes mediating TOR signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The seeds of wild type (WT) tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) cv.

The proliferating cells in callus apparently have genetic identity similar to primordial cells of emerging lateral roots [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whereas organogenesis in RS is associated with localized expression of a subset of <italic>PLETHORA</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In either case, cellular programing requires a shift in metabolic networks to provide the energy needed for cell division/expansion and differentiation. In the animal system, this is regulated by reprogramming of anabolism by the action of mTOR1 that acts as the master regulator of this shift [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In plants, evidences have been emerging that target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase reprograms transcriptional networks regulating metabolism directed for energy and cellular mass production for developmental transitions [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

In plant cells, an extensive amount of carbohydrates is also required for biosynthesis of cell walls, a pathway that is regulated by TOR signalling [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In conformity with this need, many of the upregulated carbohydrates in the callus and RS likely provide precursors for the cell wall biosynthesis.</p><p>To meet the demand of intensive protein synthesis, the levels of several amino acids were upregulated in the callus and RS. The high levels of glutamate and GABA indicate an active operation of C/N shunt in the callus cells. Emerging evidences indicate that GABA inhibits root growth via modulation of anion channels [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and high concentration of GABA inhibits root elongation [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Since callus cells are physiologically closer to lateral root primordial [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the GABA upregulation may be part of metabolomic homeostasis to promote root cell specific identity in the callus.</p><p>The callus formation also reduces several metabolites derived from the hydroxycinnamic acid (caffeate and caffeoylquinate) pathway that have a role in cell wall lignification [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Considering that pipecolate seemingly inhibits cell division [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], it is possible that reduction in its abundance may also be related to ongoing active cell proliferation in callus and RS. Similar to pipecolate, the decline in levels of 3-methyl-2-ketopiperazine may be related to lowering of immunity, as evidences are emerging that diketopiperazine and its derivative have antimicrobial role in a wide range of plant species (European Patent EP2594134A2). In plants, emerging evidences support that growth is inversely correlated with the immunity and the trade-off between these two responses is achieved by integrating hormonal/biotic signalling with developmental programs [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

It was suggested that inclusion of dopamine in media may have regulated the endogenous level of IAA probably by inhibiting IAA oxidase activity.

In tomato cotyledon/callus/RS, out of nine hormones examined, only IAA, ABA, zeatin, MeJa, and SA were detected.

The reduction in IAA levels in RS of <italic>shr</italic> mutant is likely related to the multifaceted interactions of NO with plant hormones [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast to auxin, the kinetin responsive gene expression is strongly distributed throughout the callus and during organogenesis, it is localised to the shoot progenitor cells facilitating cell division [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The above balancing is presumably achieved by altering the hormonal interactions with the metabolites. Such hormonal alteration is overtly evident as WT, <italic>shr</italic>, and <italic>pct1-2</italic> callus networks share only zeatin and SA as common hormones. While WT and <italic>shr</italic> share MeJa, <italic>pct1-2</italic> and <italic>shr</italic> share ABA, and IAA exclusively maps only in <italic>shr</italic>. It can be surmised that hormonal shift is part of compensation mechanism to overcome the likely adverse effect of <italic>shr</italic> and <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutations. Such a compensation mechanism is essential for living cells to build metabolic networks strongly robust against mutations to sustain essential functions and cellular metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The observed compensation may stem from genetic redundancy, where a mutation has little effect on the overall development of organism due to compensation by other genes [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The existence of very few unique interactions in networks of cotyledons, callus and RS of WT with <italic>shr</italic> and <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutants is also in conformity with the robust regulation of cellular homeostasis.</p><p>In eukaryotes, the TOR signalling pathway is considered to play a critical role in regulating cellular metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Down-regulation of the <italic>TOR</italic> gene triggered massive shifts in the primary metabolites with increase in the levels of several amino acids, TCA cycle intermediates and GABA in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Likewise, increase in amino acids, and other metabolites were also observed in long day-grown plants of <italic>lst8</italic> mutants of Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Tomato callus too shows a similar metabolic shift with increase in levels of amino acids, GABA, and TCA cycle intermediates. Therefore, it is logical to assume that above metabolic shift in callus may be related to alteration in the TOR signalling pathway. Consistent with this view, callus formation is associated with a severe decline in expression of <italic>LST8</italic> transcript in WT and both mutants. It is believed that TOR associates with the RAPTOR and LST8 to form a functional TORC1 complex [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the reduction in the level of <italic>LST8</italic> may, in turn, modulate TOR signalling as LST8 is required for optimal functioning of TORC1 complex and associated signalling. A link between <italic>TOR</italic> silencing and calli formation has been observed in Arabidopsis seedlings where prolonged ethanol-induced silencing of <italic>TOR</italic> initiates calli like structure on hypocotyl and near apical meristem [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, it is reported that TOR and S6K are involved in a pathway to repress cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Consistent with this, observed lowering of <italic>S6K</italic> transcript levels during callus formation may be linked with the sustenance of cell proliferation in the callus.</p><p>Current evidences indicate that TOR signalling pathway in association with hormonal regulation and cell proliferation control pathways combinedly balance resources for growth and proliferation of cells [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The increase in the number of hormonal regulators in the network and the shift in their interaction with metabolites in callus network in <italic>shr</italic> and <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutant is in consonance with the need for alternate routes to sustain the metabolomic homoeostasis. In yeast, several loss-of-function mutations have a smaller effect on the growth and development as the metabolic network is sustained by alternate routes [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In callus network, the robustness is likely attained by remodelling of hormonal and metabolite interactions in mutants by a shift in positive and negative interactions and usage of alternate routes to sustain the metabolomic metabolism. Considering that TOR acts as a central regulator of metabolic networks, this remodelling may involve hormonal regulation of TOR signalling pathway. Evidences indicate that auxin specifically activates TOR/S6K1 signalling by regulating phosphorylation of S6K1 and promoting association of TOR with polysomes to stimulate mRNA translation [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Likewise, nitric oxide may regulate TOR signalling pathway by nitrosylation of proteins and interaction with other plant hormones [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0176978.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Such modulation is apparent in <italic>shr</italic> callus where IAA also maps on network presumably to counteract the effects of elevated NO on the cellular homeostasis.</p><p>In contrast to callus, the transformation from callus to RS elicited only a moderate change in metabolic networks as evident by networks with very few nodes. Among these, <italic>pct1-2</italic> had most dense network and WT had most scattered network. Ostensibly, callus to RS transformation involved continuation of the cell divisions, which was already initiated during callus formation and only additional change was initiation of organogenesis and shoot growth. In RS, unlike callus, no single hormone was common between WT, <italic>shr</italic>, and <italic>pct1-2</italic> networks. Moreover, the interactions among hormones were completely different than callus and also between WT and mutants. It can be surmised that similar to the callus, in RS too, the difference between WT and mutant metabolic networks likely results from compensation to overcome the effect of <italic>shr</italic> and <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study indicates that in the callus, and in regenerated shoot, other than zeatin and auxin that are present in culture media, the endogenous hormones also play an important role in maintaining metabolomic homeostasis. The robustness of the metabolism and cellular proliferation is maintained by remodelling of hormonal interactions with metabolites. This remodelling likely overcomes the effect of the excess nitric oxide in <italic>shr</italic> and enhanced auxin transport in <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutants on metabolomic homeostasis by a compensation mechanism which remains to be deciphered, but may involve regulation of TOR signalling. Our results also indicate that proliferation of cells in the callus also involves the reduction in the cell wall lignification and lowering of the cellular immunity. It has to be noted that by no means our analysis is comprehensive, as our study includes only a limited number of metabolites/hormones and their interactions. Our analyses do not include the metabolites/ hormones present in very low abundance or those that could be detected by alternate methods. A more detailed analysis at systems level integrating transcriptome, proteome and metabolome may provide more information about how metabolomic homeostasis is regulated during callus formation and shoot regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of metabolites, methods of identification and categories of the metabolites detected in the study.</title><p>SD, metabolites detected based on standards.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Sequences of primers used for the quantitative real-time PCR of TOR signaling pathway genes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>List of samples and its score for PC1 to PC5 used for combined principal component analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>List of metabolites and PC1 and PC2 loading score for principal component analysis for aggregated analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>List of metabolites and their relative levels in cotyledon, callus and RS of <italic>shr</italic> and <italic>pct1</italic>-2 in comparison to WT tissue/organ of respective stage.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>List of metabolites and phytohormones, their levels in five replicates of cotyledon, callus, and in RS of WT (A), <italic>shr</italic> (B) and <italic>pct1-2</italic> (C).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s007"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title>Full names of metabolites along with the abbreviated names depicted on the networks.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s008"><label>S8 Table</label><caption><title>List of metabolites with p-value, FDR (q) value along with the Bonferroni correction.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s009"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Different stages of culture of tomato WT, <italic>shr</italic> and <italic>pct1-2</italic> mutants.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Phenotype of 9&#x02013;10 days old cotyledons used as explants. <bold>(B)</bold> Trimmed cotyledons placed on CIM <bold>(C)</bold> Initiation of callus after 20&#x02013;25 days of incubation on cotyledon margin <bold>(D)</bold> Callus after second subculture on SIM <bold>(E)</bold> Differentiated tissue.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176978.s009.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176978.s010"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Heat map showing the levels of hormones (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264;0.05) at cotyledon (Co), callus (Ca) and RS stage of WT, <italic>shr</italic>, and <italic>pct1-2</italic>.</title><p>The relative levels are indicated by varying color intensity (low-blue, high-red) with reference to respective cotyledons.
