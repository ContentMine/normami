    "In plants, leaf is crucial for photosynthesis and respiration. Leaf area and quantity are important for leaf vegetables to increase biomass. The process of leaf development involves coordinated regulation among small RNAs, transcription factors and hormones. Here, we found leaf size were regulated by transcription factors NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 in Arabidopsis. NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 overexpression increased biomass accumulation through promoting leaf growth and cell expansion. NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 were expressed in SAM and leaf vasculature. Endogenous IAA content reduced by 20% and 24% in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 compared to wild-type plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 bound directly to the cis-element CCAAT in the promoter of the YUC2, and decreased the expression of YUC2, a YUCCA family gene. The auxin transporter gene PIN1 and auxin response factor1 and 2 (ARF1 and ARF2) genes, transcriptional repressors, were downregulated. These findings showed leaf development was regulated by NF-YA2 and NF-YA10 through the auxin-signaling pathway and may provide a new insight into the genetic engineering of vegetables biomass and crop productivity."
