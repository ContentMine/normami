    "NAC proteins comprise of a plant-specific transcription factor (TF) family and play important roles in plant development and stress responses. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is the prime candidate and model bioenergy grass across the world. Excavating agronomically valuable genes is important for switchgrass molecular breeding. In this study, a total of 251 switchgrass NAC (PvNACs) family genes clustered into 19 subgroups were analyzed, and those potentially involved in stress response or tissue-specific expression patterns were pinpointed. Specifically, 27 PvNACs were considered as abiotic stress-related including four membrane-associated ones. Among 40 tissue-specific PvNACs expression patterns eight factors were identified that might be relevant for lignin biosynthesis and/or secondary cell wall formation. Conserved functional domains and motifs were also identified among the PvNACs and potential association between these motifs and their predicted functions were proposed, that might encourage experimental studies to use PvNACs as possible targets to improve biomass production and abiotic stress tolerance."
