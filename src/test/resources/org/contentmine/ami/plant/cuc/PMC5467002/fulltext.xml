Currently, how ICE1 stability in fruits under cold stress is controlled remains largely unknown. Here, we reported the possible involvement of a SEVEN IN ABSENTIA (SINA) ubiquitin ligase MaSINA1 from banana fruit in affecting MaICE1 stability. MaSINA1 was identified based on a yeast two-hybrid screening using MaICE1 as bait. Further yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assays confirmed that MaSINA1 interacted with MaICE1. The expression of <italic>MaSINA1</italic> was repressed by cold stress. Subcellular localization analysis in tobacco leaves showed that MaSINA1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus. <italic>In vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay showed that MaSINA1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. More importantly, <italic>in vitro</italic> and semi-<italic>in vivo</italic> experiments indicated that MaSINA1 can ubiquitinate MaICE1 for the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation, and therefore suppressed the transcriptional activation of MaICE1 to MaNAC1, an important regulator of cold stress response of banana fruit. Collectively, our data reveal a mechanism in banana fruit for control of the stability of ICE1 and for the negative regulation of cold stress response by a SINA E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>banana fruit</kwd><kwd>cold stress</kwd><kwd>E3 ligase</kwd><kwd>ICE1</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Banana (<italic>Musa acuminata</italic>) is one of the most popular fruit crops worldwide (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2016</xref>). As a typical climacteric fruit, bananas have a very limited shelf-life due to rapid softening (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Practically, low temperature storage is an effective technology to maintain post-harvest banana fruit qualities and to extend its shelf-life. However, being tropical fruits, banana fruit are highly sensitive to cold stress, and storage at low temperatures (&#x0003c;13&#x000b0;C) results generally in peel browning and failure of ripening, causing severe post-harvest losses (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), which restricts the application of low temperature storage during transportation of banana fruit.</p><p>Cold stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth and development, productivity, product quality, post-harvest life and geographic distribution (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Knight and Knight, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Janmohammadi et al., 2015</xref>). To overcome this constraint, plants have developed sophisticated responses at the physiological and biochemical levels (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2016</xref>). Over the last decades, enormous progress has been achieved in the identification of important components involving in the cold signaling network, among which the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION (ICE)&#x02013;CREPEAT BINDING FACTOR/DRE BINDING FACTOR&#x02013;COLD REGULATED (ICE-CBF-COR) transcriptional cascade is pretty well understood (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Medina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wisniewski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). In this pathway, <italic>CBFs</italic> are induced rapidly by cold stress, and in turn activate downstream <italic>COR</italic> genes to increase plant cold tolerance. ICEs encode MYC-type bHLH transcription factors (TFs) that can activate <italic>CBFs</italic> gene expression via binding to their promoters (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chinnusamy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is well-known that ICE-CBF-COR pathway is positively or negatively controlled by many important regulators at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. Among these regulators, CAMTA3 (calmodulin-binding transcription activator 3) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>), SIZ1 (for SAP and Miz1) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Miura et al., 2007</xref>) and OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>) are positive regulators, while MYB15 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>), HOS1 (HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENES1) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2014</xref>) EIN3 (ethylene insensitive 3) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2012</xref>) and JA ZIM-domain 1/4 (JAZ1/4) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>) function as negative regulators of ICE-CBF-COR pathway. For example, HOS1 ubiquitinates and degrades ICE1 protein via the 26S proteasome pathway, indicating that HOS1 attenuates cold responses by triggering ICE1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). On the contrary, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, SIZ1 sumoylates ICE1, antagonizing the polyubiquitination of ICE1 to facilitate its stability, thus causes enhanced cold tolerance (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Miura et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, the protein kinase OST1 is also shown to phosphorylate ICE1 to enhance its stability and transcriptional activity, resulting in increased cold tolerance (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that the regulation of ICE1 protein stability is important to ensure effective cold stress response. Although the UPS-mediated protein degradation is an important post-translational regulatory mechanism for controlling the abundance of key regulators, and has emerged as an integral player in plant response and adaptation to environmental stresses, its involvement in regulating ICE1 stability in relation to cold stress response of economical fruits, such as bananas, needs to be investigated.</p><p>Giving the increasing demand of cold storage and the cold sensitivity of banana fruit, we are aiming at the molecular mechanism(s) of the cold response in banana fruit, which will contributes to genetic improving cold tolerance, fruit quality and storage potential. Our previous studies have shown that two banana fruit MYC2 proteins act together with ICE1, which is related to the methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced chilling tolerance (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a cold-responsive NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) TF MaNAC1, is a novel direct target of MaICE1 and may be associated with cold stress through interacting with MaCBF1 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the factors controlling ICE1 protein stability associated with cold stress response of banana fruit are far from being clearly elucidated. In this study, we report that a SEVEN IN ABSENTIA (SINA) E3 ligase MaSINA1 interacts with and ubiquitinates MaICE1, leading to the degradation of MaICE1 and the attenuation of its transcriptional activity. Our study thus reveals that MaSINA1 may negatively regulate cold stress response of banana fruit via controlling MaICE1 stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Treatments</title><p>Pre-climacteric banana (<italic>M. acuminata</italic>, AAA group, cv.

However, tropical and subtropical fruits, like bananas, are easily susceptible to chilling injury, resulting in quality deterioration and substantial losses, which significantly shortens storage life (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, revealing the molecular mechanism(s) of the cold response in banana fruit is important for the genetic improvement of cold tolerance and improving fruit quality and storage potential. Currently, the most well-known cold signaling pathway is ICE-CBF-COR cascade (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we also previously found that ICE-CBF pathway is positively involved in cold stress response of banana fruit (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). However, regulators that act upstream in this cascade have not been identified. In this study, we sought to identify a SINA ubiquitin ligase MaSINA1 from banana fruit, and show that MaSINA1 controls MaICE1 protein stability via the UPS.</p><p>The UPS serves as a versatile post-translational modification, and has been implicated in almost all aspects of growth and development, as well as in responses to biotic and abiotic stress in plants (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lyzenga and Stone, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Stone, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Specificity of the UPS is controlled mainly by the substrate-recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases, and consequently, a large number of E3 ligases, have been isolated and shown to be involved in plant stress responses by modulating the abundance of key downstream stress-responsive TFs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lyzenga and Stone, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Stone, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). However, only a few ubiquitin ligases such as HOS1, CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> F-box protein 7 (FBP7), have been implicated in cold stress response (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barrero-Gil and Salinas, 2013</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HOS1 was the first RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase to act as a negative regulator of cold responses (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). Under normal growth conditions, HOS1 did not affect the nuclear localization and the abundance of GFP-ICE1, while HOS1 can interact with and ubiquitinate ICE1 for degradation under cold stress (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with a role in mediating ICE1 degradation, overexpression of HOS1 results in reduced expression of cold- responsive genes and increased sensitivity to cold stress (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting HOS1 functions to attenuate stress signaling. Strangely, no interaction was found between banana fruit MaHOS1 and MaICE1 (data not shown). Indeed in the present work, another RING-type E3 termed MaSINA1 was identified from banana fruit. MaSINA1 showed high sequence similarity to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SINAT5 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>), and was repressed by cold stress (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). We also found that MaSINA1 interacted with and ubiquitinated MaICE1 and promoted MaICE1 degradation via the UPS (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). In addition, we demonstrated that MaSINA1 attenuated the <italic>trans</italic>-activation of MaICE1 to MaNAC1 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). Based on these results, it could be speculated that MaSINA1 negatively regulates cold stress response of banana fruit by promoting the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of MaICE1 protein. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report that except HOS1, another novel E3 ubiquitin ligase controls ICE1 protein stability in fruits. Previously, we also showed that unlike <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ICE1, cold-induced phosphorylation of MaICE1 might not be necessary for its transcriptional activity, but could enhance its <italic>trans</italic>-activation ability (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). The present data also reveal that the regulators of controlling ICE1 stability via UPS during cold stress response might be different in banana fruit and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, whether MaICE1 stability controlled by MaSINA1 is cold-dependent or -independent needs to be elucidated. In addition, it should be pointed out that ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification and de-ubiquitination enzymes (ubiquitin proteases) are also involved in modulating protein function (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barrero-Gil and Salinas, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the participation of ubiquitin proteases in plant responses to cold stress will be a subject of future research.</p><p>Besides ubiquitination, protein phosphorylation and sumoylation also play an important role in the regulation of ICE1 activity under cold stress (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chinnusamy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barrero-Gil and Salinas, 2013</xref>). In contrast with HOS1, SIZ1 mediates sumoylation of ICE1, which reduces the polyubiquitination of ICE1 to enhance its stability (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Miura et al., 2007</xref>). Although a very earlier research hypothesized that cold stress induces phosphorylation of ICE1 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chinnusamy et al., 2007</xref>), until recently, the hypothesis is confirmed by <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al. (2015)</xref>. They found that under cold stress, OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1), a well-known Ser/Thr protein kinase in ABA signaling, phosphorylates ICE1 to antagonize the degradation of ICE1 mediated by HOS1. More interestingly, the OST1 protein also competes with HOS1 to bind to ICE1, thus releasing ICE1 from the HOS1-ICE1 complex. Thus, the dual role of OST1 contributes to the enhancement of ICE1 stability (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous study also indicated that the <italic>trans</italic>-activation ability of MaICE1 is enhanced by MaICE1 phosphorylation. Given that ICE1 protein stability is regulated by various post-translational modifications, it is of interest to find out how these modifications are coordinately balanced to maintain ICE1 homeostasis in response to cold stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, a banana fruit SINA ubiquitin ligase MaSINA1 was identified. MaSINA1 can ubiquitinate MaICE1 for the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation, and therefore suppresses the transcriptional activation of MaICE1.
