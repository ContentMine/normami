Many factors regulate germination and these interact extensively, forming a complex network of inputs that control the seed-to-seedling transition. Our understanding of the direct regulation of gene expression and the dynamic changes in the epigenome and small RNAs during germination is limited. The interactions between genome, transcriptome and epigenome must be revealed in order to identify the regulatory mechanisms that control seed germination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We present an integrated analysis of high-resolution RNA sequencing, small RNA sequencing and MethylC sequencing over ten developmental time points in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds, finding extensive transcriptomic and epigenomic transformations associated with seed germination. We identify previously unannotated loci from which messenger RNAs are expressed transiently during germination and find widespread alternative splicing and divergent isoform abundance of genes involved in RNA processing and splicing. We generate the first dynamic transcription factor network model of germination, identifying known and novel regulatory factors. Expression of both microRNA and short interfering RNA loci changes significantly during germination, particularly between the seed and the post-germinative seedling. These are associated with changes in gene expression and large-scale demethylation observed towards the end of germination, as the epigenome transitions from an embryo-like to a vegetative seedling state.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study reveals the complex dynamics and interactions of the transcriptome and epigenome during seed germination, including the extensive remodelling of the seed DNA methylome from an embryo-like to vegetative-like state during the seed-to-seedling transition.

They can remain dormant for years before becoming highly metabolically active as the seed germinates and transitions into a seedling. Seeds constantly perceive specific cues, such as the presence of water, light, temperature and nutrients, which trigger molecular responses and enable germination to progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These responses include hormone signalling, among which the antagonistic interactions between abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) are most intensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Alterations in the levels of microRNAs (miRNAs), transcripts or DNA methylation affect seed dormancy, seed viability, germination and seedling development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These layers of regulation interact extensively, with the result that a complex network of inputs contributes to germination and successful seedling establishment.</p><p id="Par24">Microarray-based transcriptomic studies in various plants have described global changes in the cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) population and hormone interactions during seed germination, such as ABA regulation of the germination transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They have also enabled network modelling of global transcriptional interactions in seeds (SeedNet) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While highly informative, microarray platforms are limited to a defined set of probes and have lower sensitivity than current RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) methods. Furthermore, RNA-seq enables discovery of unannotated loci specific to the developmental stage or tissue studied and allows the quantification of individual isoforms. Alternative splicing patterns may also be stage or tissue-specific and can influence mRNA stability or protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, differential splicing occurs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) pollen and seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Alternative splicing expands the repertoire of transcripts derived from a genome: the latest genome annotation of Arabidopsis (Araport11) documents 48,359 transcripts corresponding to 27,655 genes.</p><p id="Par25">RNA silencing is a mechanism for genome regulation and defence that targets transcripts and genomic loci using small RNAs (sRNAs) Sequence complementarity between the sRNA and the locus or transcript guides the RNA silencing machinery to its target. MiRNAs are a type of sRNA that regulate complementary transcripts by degradation or repression of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They have a regulatory role in plant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and under stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For example, miRNA159 and miRNA160 interact with ABA/GA signalling pathways during seed germination in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 23&#x02013;24&#x000a0;nt are involved in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, recruiting the de novo methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED 2 (DRM2) to methylate cytosines in all contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While 20&#x02013;22-nt siRNAs primarily mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing through cleavage of their complementary targets, they are also able to direct DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. DNA methylation influences chromatin structure and has a constitutive role in the transcriptional regulation of genes and repeats. DNA methylation profiles also display tissue specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], are remodelled during plant sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and react to biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. DNA methylation is maintained through mitotic and meiotic replication by DNA methyltransferases with distinct sequence affinities. MET1 maintains CG methylation, CMT3 performs CHG methylation (where H is any nucleotide but G) and CMT2 methylates several CHH cytosine contexts to variable extents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. During germination, DNA demethylation has been observed in pepper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Loss-of-function mutations in genes involved in DNA methylation, such as <italic>MET1</italic>, and demethylation, such as <italic>DEMETER</italic>, result in embryo-defective phenotypes in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], indicating that the regulation of DNA methylation in the seed is essential for normal development.</p><p id="Par26">To reveal the molecular networks governing seed germination in Arabidopsis, we assayed genome-wide sites of DNA methylation (MethylC-seq), the transcriptome (RNA-seq) and the cellular sRNA population (sRNA-seq) over an extensive time course, from before seed desiccation through stratification and germination to post-germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(i)). We detected 50% more differentially expressed genes (DEG) during germination compared to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A total of 620 genes used isoforms differentially during germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii)), significantly expanding upon prior single gene studies during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A total of 163 previously unannotated differentially expressed (DE) loci were identified during germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii)). Transcription factor (TF) regulatory network models confirmed the involvement of known germination regulators, such as ABI5 and ATHB5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and identified new TFs that may regulate specific stages of germination. We observed delayed germination in seven out of eight lines carrying mutations in TFs predicted to be important by the model. The germination transcriptome was disrupted by each of the eight TF mutations. Significant differential expression of miRNAs and siRNAs were detected during germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii)) and extensive epigenetic remodelling was observed between the seed and post-germinative seedling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii)), with CHH hypomethylation detected at 12,654 loci. Our study provides an unprecedented view into the dynamics and interactions of the epigenome and transcriptome during seed germination. It also expands our knowledge of the complexity of direct TF-gene interaction and sets the foundation for a systems-level understanding. The specific regulators and miRNAs presented here are excellent candidates for manipulation to modify germination characteristics.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the extensive transcriptomic and epigenetic remodelling that occurs during seed germination. <bold>a</bold> (i) The time course examined in this study.

Our approach was to measure RNA, sRNA and mC dynamics across a time series from dry seed to seedling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(i, ii)) and to relate these to the major developmental transitions during germination. Furthermore, we aimed to identify TFs that regulate transcript abundance by integrating gene targeting data with the expression time series. This would enable us to increase systems-level understanding of the direct regulators of gene expression during germination, a notable gap in current knowledge. To facilitate visualisation, evaluation and reuse of our data, all transcriptomes, sRNA-omes, methylomes and useful annotations (TF binding peaks, sRNA loci, differentially methylated regions [DMRs]) are integrated in a JBrowse browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbrowse.latrobe.edu.au/germination_epigenome">https://jbrowse.latrobe.edu.au/germination_epigenome</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par28">We observed seed swelling associated with water uptake following 48&#x000a0;h of stratification (S) then 12&#x000a0;h in the light (L; combined treatment termed 12&#x000a0;h SL) and radicle emergence occurred by 24&#x000a0;h SL. The rapid germination of these seeds is consistent with their expected lack of dormancy, given that they were harvested from plants grown at 22&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, we stratified seeds in this experiment to reflect common lab germination procedures for Arabidopsis accession Col-0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abrc.osu.edu/seed-handling">https://abrc.osu.edu/seed-handling</ext-link>). Over this time course, we first analysed the dynamics of transcript abundance during germination by whole-transcriptome RNA-seq (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii); Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: SD1). This enabled the identification of unannotated loci (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii) and b) and revealed over 24,283 DEGs during germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>(ii); Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: SD1), a 50% increase over previous microarray studies where fewer than 16,000 DEGs were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We defined three clusters on the basis of their profiles using hierarchical clustering; grouping genes whose expression increased or decreased by the end of the time course or showed a transient peak during seed germination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). The gene ontology (GO) functional enrichments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/">http://geneontology.org/</ext-link>) in each cluster were consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]: light-related and root-related functions were enriched in the cluster of genes with highest expression in the seedling, RNA splicing and histone functions were enriched for genes with high expression in dry seed and genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and RNA-related functions were enriched among the transiently expressed genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p id="Par29">We next analysed alternative splicing during germination to determine its contribution to transcriptome reprogramming. Relative abundance of isoforms from the same gene was positively correlated in the majority of cases. However, isoforms of 141 genes were anti-correlated (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients below &#x02013;&#x02009;0.5), suggesting isoform usage may vary during germination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). We found that the hierarchy of primary and secondary isoforms was inverted for 620 genes during germination (their ratio of expression spanned a range outside of 0.5:2; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). Hierarchical clustering of these ratios showed that isoform variation was particularly distinct between dry seed and post-imbibition, suggestive of time-specific or tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing during seed germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Of the genes with isoform variation, 612 were also differentially expressed at the gene level and 54% of these belonged to cluster C3 (highest expression in seeds, then decreasing over germination&#x02014;as defined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1), which is significantly more than the expected percentage of genes in C3 compared to the total percentage in the genome (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Alternative splicing of RNA processing genes occurs during germination. <bold>a</bold>

</p><p id="Par30">The highly dynamic alternative splicing during seed germination affected splicing regulators themselves. GO analysis revealed significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) enrichment of genes involved in nucleotide/nucleoside binding, mRNA processing and nucleic acid metabolic processes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Interestingly, GO enrichment analysis indicated these were enriched in the nuclear speck, where splicing factors are known to be localised (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). A role for alternative splicing of phytochrome interacting factor 6 (<italic>PIF6</italic>, At3g62090) and serine-arginine-rich (SR) protein 45 (<italic>SR45</italic>, At1g16610) has been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We found complex variations in total and relative abundance of their multiple isoforms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>). <italic>SR45</italic> encodes a key pre-mRNA splicing factor in Arabidopsis, the alternative splicing of which affects petal development and root growth during early seedling development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. SR45 regulates glucose and ABA signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], with over 30% of all ABA signalling genes associated with or regulated by SR45 at the post-splicing level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Alternative splicing of <italic>PIF6</italic> influences rates of ABA-dependent seed germination in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We found that phytochrome B (PhyB, At2g18790), which interacts with PIF6, also showed isoform variation during seed germination: isoform At2g18790.1 predominated before seed imbibition but At2g18790.2 was the dominant isoform at 12&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h into dark stratification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). PhyB itself plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finally, polypyrimidine tract binding protein homologs (PTBs) are key regulators of alternative splicing, with 310 transcripts spliced alternatively when PTB levels are altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Notably, 28 of these 310 previously identified transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] also showed significant isoform variation in our study, suggesting that PTB mediated regulation of alternative splicing may occur for these genes during seed germination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The germination program includes previously unannotated loci</title><p id="Par31">The fixed set of probes used in microarrays precludes the detection of novel transcripts from unannotated loci, meaning that the current germination transcriptome datasets may be incomplete. We mined our whole transcriptome RNA-seq data to discover regions that were previously unannotated and that may be specific to germination.

Most of the annotated genes encoded nuclear or mitochondrial proteins (nuclear-encoded); there was a significant enrichment of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) compared to the expected percentage based on the genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Previous microarray studies identified a set of annotated genes showing germination-specific expression compared to other tissues, which were enriched in genes encoding nuclear and mitochondrial proteins, particularly those known to be embryo/seedling lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our dataset included four genes annotated as involved in developmental processes, three of which were known embryo lethal genes (maternal embryo effect [MEE]) and the fourth, a known miRNA-targeted TF involved in cell differentiation (LOM2- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). These were differentially expressed during germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) and were homologous to four unannotated loci, which are consequently interesting candidates to examine for essential functions in the seed/seedling. Expression of an unannotated locus with significant alignment to another miRNA-targeted TF (At3g23690, belonging to the bHLH family) is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. Like most of the unannotated expressed loci, this locus showed a transient peak in expression during germination before decreasing in expression in the seedling (LOC_022087; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Notably, 50 of the 66 genes that were the top BLAST alignments with unannotated loci were also significantly differentially expressed during germination. However, for more than half of these, the expression of the unannotated loci did not correlate very well with the expression of the respective homologous annotated genes (27/50 had |r|&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5). Thus, further examination of these loci is necessary to determine whether they are unannotated exons of nearby genes or completely novel genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>A complex transcription factor network regulates gene expression during germination</title><p id="Par33">In order to identify the key TFs driving the transcriptional dynamics during seed germination, we carried out DREM (Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]) modelling of our RNA-seq time course (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). DREM defines transcriptional modules comprising transcripts with similar expression changes between time points. It then searches for TF-binding events enriched among the gene-encoding transcripts within modules. We subsequently hypothesise that the TFs identified may regulate those expression changes. DREM takes known TF&#x02013;gene interactions as an input, which we provided from a comprehensive set of genome-wide target genes for 287 TFs, derived using published DNA affinity purification (DAP)-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The associated TF families changed over the time course (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Of the two modules that are downregulated during the first 12&#x000a0;h of stratification, one is regulated primarily by NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC2) TFs (28 out of 43 annotated TFs) and bZIP (basic-leucine zipper) TFs (six annotated), while the other is dominated by AP2EREBP TFs (14 out of 27 annotated factors). NAC TFs are a diverse family involved in a range of developmental programs, stress and defence responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but their role in germination has not been characterised so far. Our model was validated by identification of known germination-regulatory TFs. For example, ABI5 was among the bZIP TFs identified. This is a known transcriptional activator that represses germination and that is progressively downregulated over the course of germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The model also identified AtHB13 as a regulatory TF during germination, which is significantly upregulated at the later stages of germination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). AtHB13 is involved in the seed to seedling transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], with the loss of function of AtHB13 resulting in increased primary root length.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Modelling the TF network controlling germination.

ATHB5/6/23/33/53 appeared in multiple upregulated branches and functions in germination have been assigned to some of them: ATHB5 participates both in the ABA and gibberellin pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]; and ATHB23 plays roles in PhyB-dependent seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">As the seeds were transferred to light after two days of stratification, TFs from the DOF (DNA-binding with one finger) family were inferred to play prominent roles in the upregulation of several transcription modules, which is consistent with their known roles in growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. One example is DAG2, a positive regulator of light-mediated germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], which is upregulated and annotates two branches that are strongly upregulated after exposure to light (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). Finally, the WRKY family of TFs annotates a number of modules. WRKY TFs are involved in many different processes including germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], but the strongest annotations in our datasets (WRKY14/24/25/27/29/45/50/65) are not well characterised.</p><p id="Par36">Although binding data are available only for a subset of Arabidopsis TFs, our model captures many of the known regulators of germination and suggests several-fold more (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3), both expanding the role of previously described TFs to new processes and suggesting functions for as yet uncharacterised TFs. However, the strength of our approach also resides in revealing the possible combinatorial action of TFs, as factors annotated in the same branch may cooperate to activate or repress a specific set of genes. This cooperation may occur through physical interaction between TFs: DOF6 binds TCP14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]; although TCP14 is absent from the DAP-seq dataset, TCP15 is present, and it annotated a module that was also enriched in DOF6 and DOF5.6 targets.

All knock-out lines were confirmed to harbour a single T-DNA insertion only and the insertions were at the intended target genes. This was achieved by whole-genome resequencing, which detects T-DNA insertions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5) Genotypes and homozygosity were further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]).

The observed phenotypes are likely caused by the T-DNA insertions we detected, but we cannot rule out deletions or translocations caused by T-DNA mutagenesis and not detected by resequencing.

Furthermore, only a few percent of the genes within branches of the DREM model annotated by the TFs were misexpressed in the mutants of that TF (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Tables S3A and S4). This reflects the fact that the transcriptional modules DREM modules represent are complex objects, regulated by a network of TFs, and therefore do not provide complete predictions of the system&#x02019;s response to a constitutive mutation.

However, the different families of TFs displayed great disparities in their overlaps with DMRs: the binding sites of AP2EREBP factors were strongly depleted in DMRs (32-fold compared to chance), which may be due in part to their binding motifs containing a CCG/CGG motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] (and thus constituting MET1/CMT3 targets rather than RdDM sites). Conversely, the binding sites of DOF and HB TFs were slightly enriched in DMRs (1.3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, corresponding to 782 and 1330 DMRs). Therefore, three-quarters of the CHH DMRs did not overlap binding sites from this subset of TFs, which would suggest that protection by TFs does not play a major role in the passive loss of DNA methylation at the seed-seedling transition stage. However, the binding data are not comprehensive and other TFs may bind more DMRs, so the full extent of the contribution of TF binding to loss of DNA methylation remains to be determined.</p><p id="Par47">We next asked whether the decrease in CHH methylation may be linked to the transcriptional reprogramming of the emerging seedling. A total of 9541 and 7242 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, between the 12&#x000a0;h SL and 48&#x000a0;h SL time points. In total, 1053 and 799 had CHH hypoDMRs in their promoters (from 1&#x000a0;kb upstream to 200&#x000a0;bp downstream of the transcriptional start site). Though there was no strong bias for upregulation of genes with hypomethylated promoters, and overall the DMRs were only very slightly enriched in promoter regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), hypomethylation of the promoters of more than 1800 DEGs is considerable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par48">In this study, we have characterised the regulatory network of transcriptomic and epigenomic changes that control Arabidopsis seed germination. Extensive transcriptome remodelling occurred from the dry seed stage, through stratification, germination and post-germination, following exposure to light. This included hundreds of previously unannotated loci, which are possibly germination-specific. We found that alternative splicing and divergent isoform usage was common in the germination transcriptome. TF families with direct regulatory roles governing specific transcriptional outputs were identified using time-series modelling. Substantial changes in sRNA populations also occurred over our time course. These included miRNAs, most of whose target transcripts were also differentially regulated across germination. However, the largest changes were in the abundance of 23&#x02013;24-nt siRNAs, which are associated with RdDM loci. This correlated with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, predominantly in the CHH context, as the seed epigenome transitioned from an embryo-like state to a vegetative seedling state. We note that extensive changes in DNA methylation, transcripts and sRNA abundance occurred during stratification, despite the lack of dormancy in the seeds we examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These changes likely reflect perception of both low temperature and imbibition by the seed, though it should be highlighted that Col-0 accession seeds harvested from plants grown at 22&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C do not exhibit secondary dormancy induced by chilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Our analyses provide unprecedented detail of the germination process that will be useful in future seed optimisation efforts.</p><p id="Par49">We identified 163 unannotated differentially regulated loci (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These predominantly showed a transient expression pattern during germination and were homologous with genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This is consistent with the resumption of active metabolism that characterises this phase of germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. A number of mutations in related transiently expressed genes are embryo-lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Consequently, the unannotated loci we identified warrant further investigation of whether they are essential for successful germination.</p><p id="Par50">One role of alternative splicing during germination is to diversify the transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This is achieved in part by divergent isoform usage of transcripts encoding the alternative splicing machinery themselves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Differential regulation of the splicing machinery has growth and developmental effects in petals and roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Some of these same components were alternatively spliced during germination, suggesting they may also play a role in seed germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">Alternative splicing also influenced light signalling genes during germination, in agreement with a prior study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Connections exist between alternative splicing, light signalling and energy availability during early photomorphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among the 620 genes with divergent isoform usage during germination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), 16 were annotated to take part in responses to light. These included <italic>PhyB</italic> (At2g18790), <italic>Photosystem II Light Harvesting Complex Gene 2.1</italic> (<italic>LHCB2.1</italic>; AT2G05100), <italic>MYB65</italic> (At3g11440) and <italic>PIF6</italic> (At3g62090). Alternative splicing of <italic>PIF6</italic> results in altered rates of ABA-dependent seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], while PhyB is required for promoting seed germination in the light via GA signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Light perception, involving PhyB, plays an important role in the spatial rearrangement of the nucleus, specifically chromatin decondensation in the later stages of seedling growth, during the transition to photomorphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This is likely important for post-embryonic transcriptional reprogramming, as the seed genome becomes more active and a greater number of genes are expressed. In combination, this confirms that alternative splicing enables integration of light responses to the regulatory network controlling seed germination.</p><p id="Par52">In our study, we illustrate the complexity of TF interactions during germination using DREM modelling of the time-series transcriptomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Numerous members of different TF families are involved at each developmental transition. Previous studies have focused on single or small numbers of TFs from specific families, but here we reveal that the regulatory network is much richer. Our modelling used target gene data obtained from an in vitro approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This method was validated as providing accurate data of true in vivo target genes, but it is likely that TF behaviour and expression varies between growth stages and tissues. Obtaining in planta binding data from seeds or individual seed tissues will reveal in greater detail the target genes that are effectively directly bound during germination. In accordance with published germination studies, we identified ABI5, ATHB23 and DAG2 among the known regulators of germination, with the latter two involved in PhyB-dependent seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">In addition to identifying known regulators of germination, our model also predicts many novel germination-regulatory TFs, whose roles have either not been characterised or have not been linked to germination. Using homozygous T-DNA insertion lines, we show that impairments of predicted germination-regulatory TFs cause delays in germination for seven out of eight candidates (<italic>athb15</italic>, <italic>athb25</italic>, <italic>lmi1</italic>, <italic>obp1</italic>, <italic>smb</italic>, <italic>vnd2</italic> and <italic>wrky14</italic>). The phenotypes observed were likely caused by the T-DNA insertions. However, the resequencing approach we used does not rule out the possibility that translocations or deletions influencing phenotype may also exist in these lines. In-depth characterisation of these TFs and genes misexpressed in their mutants will allow the reconstitution of a more comprehensive regulatory network governing germination, while application of inducible systems that combine multiple TFs may allow finer control over transcriptional modules. This modelling approach notably expands the number of validated germination-regulatory TFs and increases our understanding of the regulatory language that controls gene expression during germination.</p><p id="Par54">The populations of miRNAs and siRNAs both changed over germination, indicating that these two distinct branches of the RNA-silencing mechanism are involved in seed&#x02013;seedling transitions (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Previous studies suggest that alternative splicing regulates miRNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This presents an interesting prospect for future investigation, given the extent of alternative splicing we and others observe during germination and early photomorphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. MicroRNAs are also known to mediate changes in de novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis by targeting the genes involved in DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], including miRNA781a and miRNA773a, which target <italic>INVOLVED IN DE NOVO 2 - like 1</italic> and <italic>DRM2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Both of these miRNAs and their confirmed targets were differentially regulated during seed germination and may have contributed to the extensive DNA hypomethylation we observed (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">A large number of differentially regulated 20&#x02013;22-nt siRNA loci overlapped differentially regulated genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7C). This size class is predominantly involved in post-transcriptional regulation of transcripts by targeted degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. A simple model of post-transcriptional gene silencing would predict negative correlations between abundances of mRNAs and their targeting siRNAs. However, as we observed both positive and negative correlations between these, more complex regulatory systems such as negative feedback loops may be involved (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7C). Consequently, the role of siRNAs in controlling gene expression during germination cannot be precisely determined. Studying germination in mutant plants deficient in siRNA pathways will shed more light on this mechanism.</p><p id="Par56">Extensive DNA demethylation occurred between the seed and post-germinative seedling, corresponding with the onset of DNA replication and cell division (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This decrease in methylation occurred almost exclusively in the CHH context and at RdDM loci. Rather than a complete removal of methylation, most DMRs underwent a quantitative reduction in DNA methylation. At most DMRs, no changes in sRNA abundance were recorded, although about 10% of DMRs could be associated with decreases or increases in sRNAs. Combined with the high expression of the RdDM machinery at this stage, these results suggest that the decrease of methylation in the seedling is mostly passive and due to a lesser efficiency of the RdDM machinery compared to the period of seed development. Indeed, comparison of the methylation profiles of our time points with publicly available datasets for embryo, endosperm and three-week-old leaf samples demonstrate that the hypermethylated seed up to 12&#x000a0;h SL is most similar to the embryo samples, whereas the emerging seedling adopts a profile that closely resembles one that is observed in leaves (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S9). This is consistent with what is known about the epigenetic reprogramming of the zygote, with increased RdDM activity supported by companion-cell-derived sRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. More than 1800 demethylated regions correspond to promoters that change in activity during the seed&#x02013;seedling transition. Although the upregulation of genes through promoter DNA hypomethylation does not appear to be a major mechanism of gene regulation during germination, it may play a role for a specific set of genes. Alternatively, changes in promoter activity may impair the recruitment of the RdDM machinery and thus contribute to the loss of methylation at these sites.</p><p id="Par57">DNA methylation affects the ability of many TFs to bind DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The majority of TFs identified as potential germination regulators by our DREM model are negatively affected by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Consequently, the DNA demethylation taking place in the emerging seedling may generate new TF binding sites, thereby re-shaping the regulatory network that governs vegetative growth. This is supported by the observation that the promoter of a TF involved in germination under salt stress, MYB74, loses DNA methylation during salt stress and that this results in increased expression of the <italic>MYB74</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. <italic>MYB74</italic> over-expressing plants also displayed hypersensitivity to salt during seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. During germination in our study, MYB74 shows significant induction in the 48-h seedling (48&#x000a0;h SL), while a region in its promoter targeted by siRNAs exhibited decreased methylation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S10).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">We present a deep characterisation of the dynamic network of interactions between transcription, alternative splicing, sRNAs and DNA methylation during germination. We reveal extensive and stage-specific switches in isoform usage, a layer of complexity in the germination transcriptome that was previously unknown. Modelling regulatory events along the germination time course allowed us to organise known TFs controlling germination and to predict a large number of novel regulatory TFs. We validated that several of the predicted regulatory TFs altered germination rate and gene expression during germination, confirming the value of our model. Finally, we uncovered the genome-wide demethylation undergone by the germinating seedling at the onset of cell division.

Following bisulfite conversion and purification, the adapter-ligated DNA molecules were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 1000, following manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. For visualisation in JBrowse we used the methylation plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation">https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation</ext-link>), courtesy of Brigitte Hofmeister.

Briefly, single-end MethylC-seq reads were trimmed with trimgalore (v0.4.2) and mapped to TAIR10 genome with Bismark v0.16.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] and default parameters. Deduplicated reads (deduplicate_bismark) were used to generate genome-wide cytosine reports (bismark_methylation_extractor, bismark2bedGraph, coverage2cytosine). The processed data were then used to identify timeseries DMRs for the three contexts (CG, CHG and CHH) using HOME-timeseries with default parameters. We further filtered out regions whose maximum absolute difference in methylation during the time course was lower than 20%. Hierarchical clustering of the methylation differences relative to the first time-point (0&#x000a0;h) distinguished hypermethylated and hypomethylated regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>DMR analysis</title><p id="Par73">Overlaps between DMRs, differential sRNA loci and genomic features were computed with the Genome Association Tester (GAT) v1.0 and default parameters.
