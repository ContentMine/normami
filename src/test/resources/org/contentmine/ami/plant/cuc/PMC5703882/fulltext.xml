<italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> L., commonly known as the physic nut and belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a native species of Mexico and Central America, is widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>J. curcas</italic> is a bioenergy tree and its seeds contain a high oil content, which has the potential to be exploited as a source of biofuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the low seed yield of <italic>J. curcas</italic> is a major drawback in its utilization as bioenergy plant, which was caused by the lower number of female flowers. Therefore, revealing the potential regulatory mechanism involved in floral sex differentiation in <italic>J. curcas</italic>, especially female floral differentiation, is critical for the improvement of female flowers and the cultivation of high-yielding <italic>J. curcas</italic> germplasms.</p><p id="Par3">Angiosperms mostly consist of bisexual flowers and but also bear unisexual flowers, which may be monoecious or dioecious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To understand the potential regulatory events during floral sex differentiation, it is important to understand the different pathways used by the plant for its propagation. The common floral organs are initiated in the whole floral primordium, but the specific differentiation of stamens or pistils governs the formation of unisexual flowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In <italic>J. curcas</italic>, the differentiation of the floral primordium to form male and female flowers is regulated by some endogenous induction effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which may affect the action of homeotic genes to initiate the formation of gynoecium or androecium meristem. The availability of the <italic>J. curcas</italic> reference genome assembly has facilitated further fundamental and applied studies on this plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Comparative transcriptome analysis between gynoecious and monoecious <italic>J. curcas</italic> plants revealed 32 genes related to the floral development and 70 involved in phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, DEGs related to auxin, ethylene and gibberellins during female and male floral differentiation and development were detected in recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, but the key genes and the regulatory mechanism involved in floral sex differentiation of <italic>J. curcas</italic> were not described. Moreover, the MADS-box gene family &#x02013; an important floral sex determinant in plants &#x02013; was also not described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The MADS-box transcription factors play vital regulatory roles in the floral differentiation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The core domain structures of these genes are very conservative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. There are 107 members related to MADS-box genes, which were clustered into class A, B, and C in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and 46 of these members belonged to the type-II subfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The genes of the ABC model co-determine the fate of floral organ primordium by complex crosstalk network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, some genes from class D and E could also join in the network to contribute to male and female floral differentiation. The ABCE model plays role during the floral differentiation of <italic>J. curcas</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. AP1 stimulates flowering and regulates the <italic>B</italic> genes, which allow the differentiation from inflorescence meristem to flower bud<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. <italic>JcAP1</italic> was shown to trigger early flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, but not <italic>J. curcas</italic>

However, <italic>JcTFL</italic> represses the flowering of <italic>J. curcas</italic>, and its overexpression in <italic>J. curcas</italic> delays flowering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The crosstalk among <italic>JcAP1</italic>, <italic>JcFT</italic>, and <italic>JcTFL</italic> might co-regulate the flowering time, but the essential genes involved in the differentiation of stamens or pistils of <italic>J. curcas</italic> have not yet been identified.</p><p id="Par5">Moreover, floral differentiation could be regulated by phytohormones, which show complex interaction networks. Gibberellins (GAs) play vital roles during floral differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and their signal transduction could be achieved by degrading the DELLA proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Auxins (IAA) have a significant effect on the maturation of female and male flowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Jasmonic acid (JA) regulates the differentiation of floral organs, and the homologs of JA biosynthesis were down-regulated in the gynoecious inflorescences of <italic>J</italic>. <italic>curcas</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The function of Cytokinins (CTKs) was reversed with GAs such that it could induce female floral differentiation in <italic>Mercurialis annua</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Brassinolides (BRs) were involved in crosstalk with GAs, and the co-regulated factors were the DELLA proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, BRs directly interact with SVP by activating BZR1, which is a new avenue in the floral-regulating network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Plant growth regulators, such as 6-Benzyl aminopurine (6-BA), thidiazuron (TDZ) and paclobutrazol (PAC), could significantly improve female flower formation in <italic>J. curcas</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Meanwhile, the female flower buds were ellipsoid. Flower buds in the inflorescence stage of 0.5&#x02009;cm diameter (IND stage) were in the primordial period with no differentiation into stamen and pistil flowers. Five stages of the floral differentiation were selected and defined as stamen primordia beginning to differentiate (STD1) or (M1), ten complete stamens formed (STD2) or (M4), carpel primordia beginning to differentiate (PID1) or (F1), three distinct carpels formed (PID2) or (F4), and undifferentiated inflorescence of 0.5&#x02009;cm diameter (IND). M1 stage was the initial stage of male floral differentiation. In this stage, the ten stamens were triggered from the male primordial, whereas in the M4 stage, stamens were formed and the complete stamens could be observed. Meanwhile, F1 stage was the initial stage of female floral differentiation and in this stage, the carpel primordial was triggered, while the complete carpel and ovule could be observed in the F4 period. The male and female flowers matured gradually after F4 and M4.

After floral sex determination, the numerous DEGs were activated to complete the development of stamens or ovules. Similar regulated events were observed in gymnosperms and lower angiosperms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which indicated that this regulated pattern is conserved in plants. However, the down-regulated DEGs in STD1 were also down-regulated in STD2, but the down-regulated DEGs in PID1 could be activated in PID2. Thus, female floral differentiation was a more complex set compared with male floral differentiation.</p><p id="Par27">In previous studies, the numerous down-regulated DEGs were attributable to the gynoecious mutation against with monoecious wild-type in Cucumber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The similar result in our study was that the DEGs were mainly up-regulated in male floral differentiation process, but down-regulated in female floral initiation. However, the DEGs up-regulated from PID1 <italic>vs</italic>. IND to PID2 <italic>vs</italic>. PID1 were more than those in the male flower differentiation from STD1 <italic>vs</italic>. IND to STD2 <italic>vs</italic>. STD1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Based on the scanning electron microscope observation, the floral differentiation process was divided into 12 stages in <italic>J. curcas</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The floral primordium is originally differentiated to male flowers from first to sixth stage, but it might be reversed to female floral differentiation by some endogenous induction effects in the seventh stage. As a result of which, the male floral primordium underwent abortion gradually in the subsequent development process. Recently, the certain genes including <italic>CUC2, TAA1, CKX1</italic>, and <italic>PIN1</italic> promote the formation of female flowers in <italic>J. curcas</italic> while the genes <italic>SUP</italic> and <italic>CRY2</italic> are involved in female flower transition and male primordia abortion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, the differentiation of arrested pistil primordia could be activated in male flowers by repressing the expression of the <italic>TS2</italic> which is required for carpel abortion in <italic>J. curcas</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, we suggested that some genes could continuously inhibit the initiation of female floral primordium in the original period of floral differentiation in <italic>J. curcas</italic>. If these genes were down-regulated to release the inhibition in the floral sex determination point, the female floral differentiation would be triggered, thereafter numerous genes would be activated in the subsequent development process, and visa versa. However, not all primordia revert to female flowers. Therefore, both male and female flowers could be present in the same inflorescence. Furthermore, the released location of the inhibition might be the female floral site observed in the present study. It was also revealed the underlying reason why the poor female flower was showed in the inflorescence of <italic>J. curcas</italic>. In further study, a strategic approach is to find the key genes related to the inhibition and releasing, and then express them with GUS protein to confirm their expressed location and function in the inflorescence. From this study, the key inhibited genes could also be knocked down to improve the female flower and increase the seed yield of <italic>J. curcas</italic>.</p><p id="Par28">Additionally, male floral differentiation was significantly associated with flavonoid biosynthesis process in the present study. The inhibition of flavonoid biosynthesis causes male sterility in Petunia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, but the same results could not be obtained in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This suggested that flavonoids may play various roles in different species. Thus, the <italic>Jatropha</italic> flavonoid pathways should be further explored to understand the regulatory events involved in male floral differentiation. Moreover, phytohormones were required to trigger and maintain the female floral initiation and development in present study. Several studies showed that female flowers could be induced by different plant growth regulators to improve the fruit yield in <italic>J. curcas</italic>

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, our data showed that the DEGs related to JA signal transduction were significantly up-regulated in PID1 <italic>vs</italic>.

Thus, a higher concentration of JA could inhibit female floral initiation, but promote its development. BRs could crosstalk with GAs to play in the floral-regulating network, and the co-regulated factor was the DELLA protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">In the present study, the DEGs involved in the BR signaling transduction pathway were significantly down-regulated in PID1 <italic>vs</italic>.

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In this study, the ABA signal associated with the female floral differentiation played in the negative regulation pathway (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The DEGs involved in negative regulation of the ABA signaling pathway were up-regulated in PID1 <italic>vs</italic>. STD1, but down-regulated in PID2 <italic>vs</italic>. PID1.

We suggested that CTK signaling triggered the initiation of female floral primordium, thereafter other phytohormones co-promoted the female floral development, including JA, BR, GA and ABA. In addition, IAA played the supporting roles in the entire floral differentiation process. This was an evidence to explain the reason that some endogenous induction effects could reverse the floral primordium to female floral differentiation in previous studies.

A further study could focus on measuring the phytohormone concentrations during the male and female floral differentiation using high performance liquid chromatography &#x02013; electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to verify the induction of endogenous plant hormone for floral sex differentiation and find the better exogenous plant growth regulator to increase the seed yield in <italic>J. curcas</italic>.</p><p id="Par33">In previous studies, the floral organ identity genes known as the ABCE model genes and the transcription factors such as <italic>JcAP-like</italic>, <italic>JcPI</italic>, <italic>JcAG</italic>, and <italic>JcSEP -like</italic> were screened in <italic>J. curcas</italic>
