    "Seed germination paves the way for the dormant embryo to establish itself as a new plant marking the first critical step in postembryonic plant growth and development. Germination starts with the uptake of water (imbibition), followed by induction of transcription, translation, energy metabolism, and cell division processes. Although small RNAs have been implicated in many developmental processes, their role during seed germination stages and conditions remained elusive. Here we show that seed germination conditions, like imbibition and temperature, dynamically regulate the expression of many developmentally important miRNAs and their targets. We have identified 58 miRNAs belonging to 30 different families at different seed germination conditions. Amongst these, 15 miRNAs and their targets were significantly differentially expressed in Arabidopsis seeds in dry and 12 h, 24 h and 48 h of imbibition. Interestingly, differential expression of miR390, which targets trans-acting siRNA locus (TAS3) derived transcripts, resulted in alteration of tasiR-ARF mediated regulation of expression of target AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARF2/3/4). Our results suggest that the dynamic expression of several miRNAs, their targets, and a crosstalk between miRNA and ta-siRNA pathways contribute to the regulation of seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana."
