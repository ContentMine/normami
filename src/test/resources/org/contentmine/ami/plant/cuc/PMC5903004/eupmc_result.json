    "Brassica crops are cultivated widely for human consumption and animal feed purposes, and oilseed rape/canola (Brassica napus and rapa) is the second most important oilseed worldwide. Because of its natural diversity and genetic complexity, genomics studies on oilseed rape will be a useful resource base to modify the quantity and quality of biomass in various crops, and therefore, should have a positive impact on lignocellulosic biofuel production. The objective of this study was to perform microarray analysis on two variable lignin containing oilseed rape cultivars to target novel genes and transcription factors of importance in Brassica lignin regulation for applied research.To gain insight into the molecular networks controlling cell wall biosynthetic and regulatory events, we conducted lignin and microarray analysis of top and basal stem sections of brown seeded Brassica napus DH12075 and yellow seeded YN01-429 cultivars. A total of 9500 genes were differentially expressed 2-fold or higher in the stem between the cultivars, with a higher number of expressed genes in the basal section. Of the upregulated genes, many were transcription factors and a considerable number of these were associated with secondary wall synthesis and lignification in B. napus and other plant species. The three largest groups of transcription factors with differential expression were C2H2 and C3HC4 zinc fingers and bHLH. A significant number of genes related to lignin and carbohydrate metabolism also showed differential expression patterns between the stem sections of the two cultivars. Within the same cultivar, the number of upregulated genes was higher in the top section relative to the basal one.In this study, we identified and established expression patterns of many new genes likely involved in cell wall biosynthesis and regulation. Some genes with known roles in other biochemical pathways were also identified to have a potential role in cell wall biosynthesis. This stem transcriptome profiling will allow for selecting novel regulatory and structural genes for functional characterization, a strategy which may provide tools for modifying cell wall composition to facilitate fermentation for biofuel production."
