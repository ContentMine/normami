The development of individual flowers on an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> inflorescence has typically been considered as highly stereotypical and uniform, but this assumption is contradicted by the existence of mutants with phenotypes visible in early flowers only. This phenomenon is demonstrated by mutants partially impaired in the biosynthesis of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA), in which floral organ growth is retarded in the first flowers to be produced but has recovered spontaneously by the 10th flower. We presently lack systematic data from multiple flowers across the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> inflorescence to explain such changes. Using mutants of the <italic>GA 20</italic>-<italic>OXIDASE</italic> (<italic>GA20ox</italic>) GA biosynthesis gene family to manipulate endogenous GA levels, we investigated the dynamics of changing floral organ growth across the early <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> inflorescence (flowers 1&#x02013;10). Modelling of floral organ lengths identified a significant, GA-independent gradient of increasing stamen length relative to the pistil in the wild-type inflorescence that was separable from other, GA-dependent effects. It was also found that the first flowers exhibited unstable organ patterning in contrast to later flowers and that this instability was prolonged by exogenous GA treatment. These findings indicate that the development of individual flowers is influenced by hitherto unknown factors acting across the inflorescence and also suggest novel functions for GA in floral patterning.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s00497-017-0320-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>Flower</kwd><kwd>Inflorescence</kwd><kwd>Modelling</kwd><kwd>Gibberellin (GA)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P16508</award-id><award-id>BB/J001295/1</award-id><award-id>Quota PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plackett</surname><given-names>Andrew R.

The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> develops an indeterminate, raceme-type inflorescence (Prusinkiewicz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>), comprising individual lateral flowers arising immediately and sequentially from an apical inflorescence meristem (IM). Floral development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> follows a well-defined programme of events (Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>) that gives rise to a stereotypical floral structure comprising a fixed sequence of concentric whorls with fixed numbers of floral organs (four sepals, four petals, six stamens and a central pistil). Organ identity within whorls is determined through overlapping expression of (and interaction between) different MADS-box genes following the ABCE model, with different whorls and organs within whorls separated by the expression of boundary genes (reviewed by Airoldi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Irish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Despite this apparent uniformity, previous observations in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> suggest that a flower&#x02019;s development is influenced by its position on the inflorescence. Mutants impaired in biosynthesis of the plant hormone gibberellin (GA) via losses of members of the <italic>GA 3</italic>-<italic>OXIDASE</italic> (<italic>GA3ox</italic>) or <italic>GA 20</italic>-<italic>OXIDASE</italic> (<italic>GA20ox</italic>) gene families demonstrate fertility and growth defects in early flowers, but not later flowers on the same plant (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>; Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Whilst GA 3-oxidase catalyses the last step in bioactive GA biosynthesis (Chiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>; Itoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1999</xref>), in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GA 20-oxidase enzymes catalyse the penultimate, rate-limiting step in the GA biosynthesis pathway (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>; Coles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>), and the GA20ox substrate GA<sub>12</sub> has recently been shown to act as a long-distance growth signal in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Regnault et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2015</xref>). Loss of three <italic>GA20ox</italic> paralogues, <italic>GA20ox1</italic>, <italic>GA20ox</italic>
<italic>2</italic> and <italic>GA20ox</italic>
<italic>3</italic>, results in an infertile, GA-deficient floral phenotype in which floral organ growth is stunted (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> mutant demonstrates a failure in silique-set specifically in early flowers associated with reduced stamen growth relative to the pistil, but this phenotype recovers spontaneously through an unknown mechanism (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). It has been inferred that the observed infertility in early <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers is caused by this mismatched growth&#x0201a; preventing pollination and thus silique-set. In a second mutant with a similar phenotype, <italic>ga3ox1 ga3ox3</italic>, the recovery of successful silique-set in later flowers was also associated with an increase in stamen growth as flowering progressed (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). Changes in floral growth with changing position of flowers along the inflorescence have thus been demonstrated, but the mechanisms underlying those changes remain unclear.</p><p id="Par5">GA itself is a candidate regulator for this process, with known roles in promoting floral organ growth and development (reviewed in Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>), but the existing evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison of bioactive GA content between early (infertile) and later (fertile) <italic>ga3ox1 ga3ox3</italic> whole floral clusters did not detect a significant difference in GA levels, suggesting that the observed phenotypic changes do not relate directly to GA (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). That said, individual, tissue-specific expression patterns have been found for each <italic>GA3ox</italic> paralogue (Mitchum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>; Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>) as has a complex feedback mechanism dynamically regulating the expression of different paralogues within and between the <italic>GA20ox</italic> and <italic>GA3ox</italic> gene families (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). In floral tissues, there is differential expression between <italic>GA20ox1</italic> and <italic>GA20ox2</italic> in the stamen filament and pistil, respectively, and up-regulation of <italic>GA20ox3</italic> in the <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> background (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). Local changes in GA biosynthesis that affect specific organ development may thus have been missed by analyses at the whole flower level. Against this argument, spontaneous recovery of floral organ growth and silique-set has been reported during very late flowering of the GA-deficient mutant <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>; Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>), in which GA biosynthesis is entirely blocked at an early stage (Silverstone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1997</xref>). However, experimental contamination by bioactive GA or the volatile GA precursor <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene (leading to endogenous GA biosynthesis in <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic>) could not be conclusively ruled out under these circumstances (King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>; Otsuka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2004</xref>; Silverstone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2001</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">To determine the contribution of GA to changes in floral organ growth across the early inflorescence, we conducted a detailed analysis of floral phenotypes in wild type (Col-0) and all combinations of <italic>ga20ox1</italic>, <italic>ga20ox2</italic> and <italic>ga20ox3</italic> loss-of-function mutant alleles across the early inflorescence, taking advantage of the phenotypic variation these mutants provide: the <italic>ga20ox1</italic> single mutant shows significant reductions in silique-set across this range, but less than <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>), whereas the <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic> floral phenotype is similar to that of <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). Whilst different genotypes displayed changes to their silique-set frequency to a greater or lesser extent across the early inflorescence, our analysis identified a common trend between them of an increasing probability of silique-set with advancing flower position, irrespective of genotype or GA status. This is correlated with a significant gradient of increasing stamen length (both relative to the pistil and in absolute terms) with advancing flower position under control growth conditions in the wild-type inflorescence and most <italic>ga20ox</italic> genotypes, including <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic>. The observed reduced growth of stamens (and petals) in early, non-silique-setting flowers of <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> was independent from this underlying gradient and instead correlated with a failure of anther dehiscence in these flowers. Thus, GA-dependent and GA-independent components were identified in association with changing floral organ growth and development across the early inflorescence.</p><p id="Par7">Unexpectedly, we found that development in the earliest flowers to form on the Col-0 wild-type inflorescence was atypical, with significantly more aberrations in organ number and structure occurring than in later flowers. Patterning became highly stereotypical in later flowers under control growth conditions, but remained unstable under exogenous GA treatment. A genetic component was identified, with <italic>ga20ox1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox3</italic> displaying altered frequencies of abnormalities. These results suggest a novel, previously unidentified role for GA in floral patterning and early floral organ development, consistent with published expression patterns for GA biosynthetic and signalling genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p id="Par8">The homozygous <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutant lines used in these experiments, comprising combinations of the <italic>ga20ox1</italic>-<italic>3</italic>, <italic>ga20ox2</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox3</italic>-<italic>1</italic> alleles in the Col-0 background, have been previously described (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>; Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>) and were compared against wild type (Col-0). Experiments characterising the frequency of silique-set during early flowering included <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic>(Col-0) as a GA-deficient control (Tyler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>). All plants were grown on Levington F2 soil under long-day (LD) conditions (16-h light, 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C; 8-h darkness, 18&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). Foliar treatments were applied to growing plants of each genotype three times a week from germination onwards as previously described (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>), comprising either mock treatment with water (control growth conditions) or 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M GA<sub>3</sub> (GA treatment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterisation of silique-set across the early inflorescence</title><p id="Par9">Plants of each genotype were allowed to develop to near-maturity, and then the presence or absence of a fertilised silique was scored across early flower positions on the primary inflorescence (unfertilised flower positions scored as &#x02018;0&#x02019; and successful silique-set scored as &#x02018;1&#x02019;). The presence or absence of developing siliques was typically a binary character, with mature siliques clearly distinct from unfertilised pistils, and wild-type levels of seed-set per silique have previously been recorded for all single and double <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutants used in this analysis despite changes to silique length (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). Where the presence of a single or a few seeds was suspected by distortion/bulging in apparently unpollinated pistils, and in cases of parthenocarpic pistil growth in response to GA treatment (Vivian-Smith and Koltunow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>), these were checked manually by dissection. Silique-set was scored at each flower position between 1 and 10 (by which point, under our growth conditions, siliques were set reliably by all genotypes except <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic> and <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic>) for each genotype under control growth conditions and under exogenous GA treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Characterisation of floral organ lengths and floral organ abnormalities across the early inflorescence</title><p id="Par10">Based on empirical evidence obtained from silique-set experiments, a range between flower positions 1&#x02013;10 was selected for more detailed analysis of floral organ growth. Position 15 was also included as a representative of later flowering for comparison. These flower positions were sampled from wild-type and <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutant inflorescences under either control growth conditions or exogenous GA treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4). Flowers were harvested from the primary inflorescence on the day of opening (floral stage 13; Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>), taking a single flower per plant over the course of the experiment. In mutants where flower opening is not evident in the earliest flowers to develop (<italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic>), the most advanced stage of development reached at each flower position was selected as a comparison. This was based on bud size, i.e. when the bud at the flower position specified had ceased to grow, and the following buds had attained a similar size, its development was adjudged to be complete. Upon harvesting, flowers were dissected and the number of floral organs in each whorl surveyed, noting the presence of any developmental abnormalities. Frequencies of deviations in floral organ number or organ developmental abnormalities were scored by type, with a value of 1 assigned for each individual instance observed. Dissected flowers were photographed, and the lengths of pistils, medial (long) stamens, petals and sepals were calculated from scaled images. Single measurements of each organ type were taken from each flower, measuring stamens, petals and sepals from where the organ joined the flower receptacle at its base to the organ tip. Pistils were measured from their base adjoining the receptacle to the lower edge of the stigma: a stamen length of 100% or greater relative to the pistil indicates that successful pollination is possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p id="Par11">Characterisation experiments were performed in blocked split-plot experimental designs (Gomez and Gomez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1984</xref>). GA treatment was applied to main plots (whole soil trays) and genotype to split plots (cells within soil trays). Silique-set data were analysed using a generalised linear model fitting a logit link function (McCullagh and Nelder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1989</xref>) and assuming a binomial distribution. Pairwise comparisons of means in significant model terms (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05, Chi-squared test) were made using individual least significant difference (LSD) values at a significance threshold of 1% (Online Resource 1). Floral organ growth was analysed both through ANOVA, utilising data from all flower positions, and linear regression modelling, for data from positions 1&#x02013;10. Where the distribution of data for individual floral organ types did not meet the assumptions of homogeneity of variance, analysis was performed on a transformed scale as required (ANOVA: square root for pistil and stamen data, Online Resource 2; linear regression: natural log for pistil and stamen data). For ANOVA, the standard error of the difference (SED) values on the relevant degrees of freedom was used to compare between genotypes at the same flower position, or between the different flower positions of one genotype within and between GA treatments, by way of the corresponding LSDs using a significance threshold of 5%. For linear regression modelling, estimated parameters (slopes and intercepts of fitted lines) are presented with calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Comparisons of pairs of appropriate parameters between genotypes were made using <italic>F</italic> tests.</p><p id="Par12">Observed frequencies of floral abnormalities were found to approximate to a Poisson distribution and were analysed as such, fitting a generalised linear model (GLM) with a square-root link function (McCullagh and Nelder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1989</xref>). In the absence of over-dispersion, the main effects and interactions between the factors genotype, GA treatment and flower position were assessed using changes in model deviance (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic>

The predicted frequencies of abnormalities from this model were compared between genotypes within GA treatments, between GA treatments within genotypes and between flower positions within GA treatments using individual LSDs with a significance threshold of 5% (Online Resource 3). The GenStat software package (2010, 13th edition; VSN International Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK) was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>A trend of increasing silique-set with advancing flower position was identified, irrespective of genotype or exogenous GA treatment</title><p id="Par13">As a proxy measure for floral organ development across early flower positions, the frequency of successful silique-set (indicating successful pollination, which necessarily requires stamen growth to have matched the pistil) during early flowering of the primary inflorescence was compared between genotypes under both control growth conditions and exogenous GA treatment. It was found that, under our growth conditions, siliques were reliably being set by flower position 10 (the first flower to develop on the inflorescence representing position 1) in all genotypes except the severely GA-deficient mutants <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic> and <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> (Online Resource 4).

We observed that there was no clear transition between early unpollinated flower positions and later successful silique-set, i.e. a flower position with a developed silique could be followed by an unpollinated position (Online resource 4). In response to the stochastic nature of this phenotype, we analysed the mean frequencies of silique-set per flower position from 12 individual primary inflorescences for each genotype between flower positions 1&#x02013;10.</p><p id="Par14">

</p><p id="Par24">Under control growth conditions, a number of <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutants demonstrated altered floral organ growth parameters across the early inflorescence compared to wild type. All <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutants except <italic>ga20ox3</italic> retained a significant positive gradient for stamen growth (significantly different from 0; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>a). In the <italic>ga20ox1</italic> mutant, where relative stamen growth is reduced in the earliest flowers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>q), stamen growth parameters were similar to wild type (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05), but initial pistil length (as described by the intercept) was significantly greater than in wild type (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In contrast, the <italic>ga20ox</italic> pistil gradient was not significantly different from wild type (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05). In consequence, reduced relative stamen growth in this genotype does not relate to changes in stamen growth but is instead the outcome of increased pistil growth throughout the early inflorescence, delaying the flower position in which stamen growth becomes sufficient to ensure pollination. Conversely in <italic>ga20ox2</italic>, which demonstrated increased relative stamen growth in some early flowers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>q), the pistil intercept was reduced compared to wild type (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), whilst the pistil gradient and stamen parameters were not significantly different from wild type (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05). Loss of <italic>GA20ox3</italic> in either the <italic>ga20ox1</italic> or <italic>ga20ox2</italic> backgrounds caused further significant changes in growth relationships (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>a), suggesting that these paralogues are not fully redundant. Modelling growth relationships at the level of the inflorescence rather than individual flowers has thus provided a better description of the processes underlying changes in relative organ growth, and through this a clearer understanding of <italic>GA20ox</italic> paralogue function.</p><p id="Par25">In the <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> background, pistil, stamen and petal growth parameters were all significantly different from those of wild-type, <italic>ga20ox1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox2</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>a). Growth parameters for these organs also differed between <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic>. In these two more severely GA-deficient genotypes, in addition to the stamen gradient, pistil and petal gradients also became significantly positive (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Sepal growth was also positive in <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), but not in the triple mutant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05). In conjunction with these positive gradients, floral organ intercept values were all reduced in these two mutants (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), reflecting shorter organs in the first flowers to open followed by an increased rate of organ growth with advancing flower position compared to wild type. These results suggest that the positive gradient in stamen growth seen under control growth conditions could be independent of GA biosynthesis and that GA-dependent floral organ growth is overlaid onto other, independent gradients.</p><p id="Par26">Under GA treatment, the growth relationships of floral organs in <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutants were mostly rescued to that of wild type (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>b). In this analysis, the wild-type inflorescence did show some response to GA treatment, with significant changes in the growth gradients of petals and sepals (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), and a significant increase in the sepal intercept (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Whilst there was no formal significant difference in wild-type stamens and pistils between control growth conditions and under GA treatment, the stamen gradient under GA treatment was found to be no longer significantly different from 0. In all GA-treated genotypes, the gradients of each floral organ type (including stamens) were either not significantly different from 0 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05) or negative (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>b). This suggests that floral organ growth responses to GA are not fully saturated in early flowers. Changes in GA biosynthesis or signalling may therefore play a role in the early wild-type inflorescence to generate organ-specific growth gradients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The recovery of <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> stamen development can be explained through a discontinuous phenotype independent of gradients in organ growth</title><p id="Par27">Stamen length relative to the pistil in the <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> mutant was found to be far more variable than in other genotypes in the earliest flowers (flower positions 1&#x02013;5; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>q). This was caused by variation in the absolute lengths of stamens, but not of pistils (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>r, s). It was noted that stamens of <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers were also frequently indehiscent in this region of the early inflorescence, but not beyond. To test for a relationship between these two factors, the lengths of floral organs from <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers with indehiscent or dehiscent anthers were plotted separately (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Whilst <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> pistils were of similar lengths between flowers with dehiscent and indehiscent anthers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), stamens with indehiscent anthers were clearly further reduced in length (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers with indehiscent anthers also showed a reduction in petal length (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), but not sepal length (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Failure in anther dehiscence in early <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers thus appears to be specifically associated with reduced growth of particular floral organs (stamen and petals) and not others (pistils and sepals).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>

With indehiscent organ lengths excluded, the difference in the gradient between <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> and wild-type stamens became much less significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 to <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.036), and the gradient of petal growth became similar (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.262).

Much of the dramatic &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; phenotype seen across the early <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> inflorescence can therefore be explained by a separable phenotype in which stamen and petal growth are restricted in flowers exhibiting indehiscent anthers.

</p><p id="Par30">It thus appears that, contrary to previous assumptions, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> floral patterning is not uniformly stereotypical across the inflorescence, with the first flowers to develop showing significant deviations and patterning not becoming fully constrained until flower four. Differences in phenotype between <italic>ga20ox1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox3</italic> suggest a possible role for GA, strongly supported by the GA treatment results. The maintenance of developmental abnormalities into later flowering under GA treatment suggests that a restriction of GA biosynthesis or signalling is involved in the imposition of stereotypical floral development beyond the first flowers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>GA-dependent effects on floral patterning were strongest in stamens</title><p id="Par31">Defects in flower morphology are likely to have arisen early in floral development, pointing to previously unrecognised functions for GA during this stage. To specify these possible functions more closely, the observed floral abnormalities were subdivided into phenotypic classes and by floral organ type: sepals (whorl 1, outermost), petals (whorl 2), stamens (whorl 3) and the pistil (whorl 4, innermost). Given that lateral (or &#x02018;short&#x02019;) stamens within whorl three arise separately, after the emergence of medial (or &#x02018;long&#x02019;) stamens (Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>), long and short stamens were treated as separate organ types. The phenotypic classes identified comprised deviations in the numbers of each floral organ type (gain or loss of organs relative to the expected number; 83.61% of abnormalities over all genotypes); organ fusion or splitting, here defined as the emergence of two partially or wholly fused organs from the same position within the floral plan (10.16%) and partial homeotic conversion of organ identity (6.23%).</p><p id="Par32">To better understand the factors underlying these different types of abnormality, the relative contributions of genotype, flower position and GA treatment were re-assessed using GLM (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>&#x0201d;). When analysing the frequency of deviations from the expected number of floral organs across all floral organ types (whole flowers), a significant interaction was found only between GA treatment and flower position (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), whilst genotype was a significant independent factor (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Within individual organ types, only individual factors remained independently significant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Similarly, no significant two- or three-way interactions were detected in relation to frequencies of floral organ fusion or homeosis for either whole flowers or individual organs (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05), but single factors remained significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The interactions detected between experimental treatments when considering all floral abnormalities together and at the scale of the whole flower are thus likely to represent a combination of multiple independent phenotypic effects occurring at a smaller scale. GA treatment significantly affected the numbers of all floral organ types (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) and the frequency of organ fusion events. In contrast, organ homeosis was not affected by GA treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.378). The effects of genotype were specific to short stamens, both in&#x000a0;their number (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006) and the occurrence of homeotic events (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.007).

</p><p id="Par33">Changes observed in the number of floral organs were not uniform: while only additional organs were detected for sepals, both organ loss and gain were observed for petals and both stamen types (see Online Resource 5). Under control growth conditions, deviations in the number of floral organ occurred most frequently in long and short stamens (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a).

</p><p id="Par34">Under control growth conditions, organ fusion events were detected in sepals and long stamens only and were most common in long stamens (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). GA treatment significantly increased the occurrence of organ fusion in long stamens only (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). Varying degrees of fusion between long stamens were observed under both control growth conditions and under GA treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d&#x02013;f). In contrast, homeosis was found only in short stamens, which always exhibited partial conversion to petal fate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g). These results indicate that stamens are the floral organ most susceptible to perturbation during early flowering, with all three types of developmental abnormality presenting within whorl 3. The frequency of two of these abnormalities is increased within the early inflorescence under exogenous GA treatment. Whilst there are known regulatory roles for GA during later stamen development (reviewed in Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>), this is the first phenotypic evidence of a role during earlier floral development when organ number and identity are set. Flower position was found to represent a significant factor in determining the numbers of long and short stamens, which likely account for the position-specific effects identified when analysing all organ types together (cf. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). The differential phenotypic responses between long and short stamens could indicate that long and short stamens might differ in some of the signalling pathways underlying their development.</p><p id="Par35">As described above, when the frequencies of all floral abnormalities were considered collectively, <italic>ga20ox1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox3</italic> showed significant differences from wild type (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), but demonstrated contrary differences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b). However, genotype is only a significant factor within short stamens (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), affecting both numbers of short stamens and short stamen homeosis. This argues that the differences between <italic>ga20ox1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox3</italic> centre on short stamen development. In support of this, the effects of genotype on the deviations in numbers of all floral organs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a) can mostly be accounted for through genotype effects on short stamens (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b).

These results indicate that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> floral development is not independent of flower position on the early inflorescence and that floral development changes as flowering progresses. This differential growth between stamen and pistil is consistent with an identified trend of increasing probability of silique-set across the early inflorescence. Stamen growth continues after flower opening (Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>), so changing stamen growth could reflect either increased final stamen length in later flowers or accelerated growth in later flowers to achieve the same length earlier in development. Within the same flowers, sepals demonstrated an opposing growth gradient, indicating that these changes are not simply a factor of increasing flower size overall. Floral organs are initiated in concentric whorls, beginning with sepals as the outermost organs and then progressing inwards (Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>). Thus, changes in size between different organ types could reflect changes during early floral development, i.e. the timing of organ specification or the size of founder cell populations. The adaptive advantage to the existence of such gradients is as yet unclear, but could represent a mechanism through which plants can improve the chance of successful self-pollination under unfavourable environmental conditions (see below). Alternatively, outcrossing in plant species is usually achieved through differential growth of male and female reproductive organs&#x02014;for example delaying stamen maturation until the pistil has been pollinated (Holtsford and Ellstrand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1992</xref>; Sherry and Lord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>). The gradients found here, during flowering of this typically self-pollinating <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> laboratory strain, may be related to this mechanism, or act to increase the likelihood of outcrossing in early flowers as part of a bet-hedging strategy to improve reproductive success.</p><p id="Par37">Modelling of floral organ growth across <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutant inflorescences found that significant gradients in floral organ growth persisted, even in the severely GA-deficient <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2 ga20ox3</italic>. The differences in stamen and pistil growth parameters between <italic>ga20ox</italic> mutants are sufficient to explain the silique-set phenotypes observed, and we identify potentially non-redundant roles for <italic>GA20ox3</italic>. The finding that reduced silique-set in <italic>ga20ox1</italic> is caused by increased pistil growth is surprising, as previous studies have supported expression of <italic>GA20ox1</italic> within the stamen and not the pistil (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). However, the expression of <italic>GA20ox1</italic>, <italic>GA20ox2</italic> and <italic>GA20ox3</italic> has been shown to be interrelated through complex feedback mechanisms (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). <italic>GA20ox2</italic> is expressed in pistil tissues during flower development (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>) and is significantly up-regulated in <italic>ga20ox1</italic> plant tissues (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Thus, feedback up-regulation of <italic>GA20ox2</italic> could feasibly enhance GA biosynthesis in the <italic>ga20ox1</italic> pistil and promote increased growth. Predictions of <italic>GA20ox</italic> gene expression changes in mutant backgrounds are complicated further by feedback links to <italic>GA3ox</italic> (GA biosynthesis) and <italic>GA2ox</italic> (GA catabolism) gene expression (Yamaguchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2008</xref>). Reduced pistil growth in the <italic>ga20ox2</italic> mutant, as identified by linear modelling, is consistent with reported <italic>GA20ox2</italic> pistil expression patterns (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>), and neither <italic>GA20ox1</italic> nor <italic>GA20ox3</italic> are up-regulated in <italic>ga20ox2</italic> tissues (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Recent quantification of GA levels from the organs of single wild-type flowers has confirmed the presence of bioactive GA specifically in the pistil, stamen and the receptacle of newly opened flowers, although the flower position sampled on the inflorescence is not indicated (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">Both the success of silique-set and floral organ lengths were found to contain inherent variability when comparing between adjacent flower positions along the early inflorescence. In addition, whilst we observed floral phenotypes for early <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers similar to those previously reported (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>), the observed rates at which spontaneous silique-set recovered appeared to differ between flower position 10 (this study) and approximately flower position 15 (Rieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Thus, whilst we necessarily refer to differences between specific floral positions based on the results obtained in this study, the positions in themselves are unlikely to hold large biological relevance to the underlying mechanism and instead reflect positions on a gradient that might itself be subject to variability. The most likely cause of the difference between these two studies is uncontrolled small variations in experimental growth conditions. Similar phenotypic discrepancies in response to growth conditions have been noted previously in relation to floral development in the <italic>GIBBERELLIN INSENSTIVE DWARF 1</italic> (<italic>GID1</italic>) GA receptor triple mutant (Iuchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>; Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; Willige et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2007</xref>; Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). Environmental factors such as temperature are known to have a significant impact on plant fertility, for example through pollen development and fertilisation (Zinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2010</xref>; De Storme and Geelan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). In some plant species, environmental stress results in differential rates of self-pollination and outcrossing through impaired male fertility (Bishop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). An interaction between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pollen development, GA and temperature sensitivity has previously been uncovered through the GA signalling negative regulator <italic>SPINDLY1</italic> (<italic>SPY1</italic>) (Jacobsen and Olszewski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1993</xref>), which is also involved in regulating responses to other abiotic stresses (Qin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>). Pollen development in the <italic>Arabidopsis GAMYB</italic> mutant <italic>myb33 myb65</italic> also demonstrates increased temperature sensitivity (Millar and Gublar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>). It would be interesting to determine the extent to which floral organ growth patterns across the inflorescence are influenced by environmental factors.</p><p id="Par39">An important question that remains is what are&#x000a0;the pathways through which these gradients are achieved and to what extent they are GA dependent. Significant gradients were found to persist in GA-deficient backgrounds, and gradual recovery of stamen growth in the severely GA-deficient <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mutant has also previously been reported during late flowering (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). As such, these gradients are unlikely to be generated solely through changes in endogenous GA biosynthesis. The presence of bioactive GA is transduced into plant developmental responses through GA-dependent binding of the GID1 receptor protein to growth-repressing DELLA proteins, triggering their rapid degradation (Harberd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>). There are five DELLA paralogues in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>GA INSENSTIVE</italic> (<italic>GAI</italic>), <italic>REPRESSOR OF GAI</italic> (<italic>RGA</italic>) and <italic>RGA</italic>-<italic>LIKE 1</italic> (<italic>RGL1</italic>), <italic>RGL2</italic> and <italic>RGL3</italic>. These demonstrate differential expression levels in flowers (Tyler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>), but their precise tissue expression patterns remain unresolved. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants lacking or with impaired DELLA function show increased elongation of pistils, stamens and petals compared to wild type (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>; Fuentes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>), demonstrating that under normal development their growth remains under some level of repression. Flowers of the DELLA <italic>global</italic> mutant (lacking all five DELLA paralogues) in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> L<italic>er</italic> ecotype self-pollinate successfully, but have reduced post-pollination fertility (Fuentes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). This mutant does demonstrate some reduction in silique-set compared to wild type L<italic>er</italic>, but this is not specific to early flowering (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). <italic>RGA</italic>, <italic>RGL1</italic> and <italic>RGL2</italic> are the dominant DELLA paralogues regulating floral organ growth in L<italic>er</italic> (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). A spontaneous late-flowering recovery of silique-set has been reported in L<italic>er ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mutants lacking two specific combinations of DELLA paralogue, <italic>GAI</italic> and <italic>RGA</italic> or <italic>RGA</italic> and <italic>RGL2</italic> (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). The early flowers of <italic>rga</italic>-<italic>24 gai</italic>-<italic>t6</italic> show impaired floral organ growth similar to <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> (Dill and Sun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2001</xref>; King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>), implying that in at least this line the late-stage rescue in silique-set occurs through recovered floral organ growth. Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>) also found that <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> plants lacking <italic>GAI, RGA</italic>, <italic>RGL1</italic> and <italic>RGL2</italic> produce fertile flowers.</p><p id="Par40">These data, the <italic>global</italic> mutant phenotype and the reported lack of phenotypic recovery in other pairwise combinations of DELLA paralogue in the <italic>ga1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> background (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>) suggest that the observed gradients in floral organ growth along the inflorescence do relate directly to the GA signalling pathway, although it would be interesting to test directly for changes in floral organ growth across the inflorescence in non-silique-setting mutants, as silique-set can also be inhibited by reductions in male or female fertility under chemically or genetically GA-overdosed conditions (Jacobsen and Olszewski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1993</xref>; Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>; Fuentes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). It can also be hypothesised that the mechanisms underlying changing floral organ growth across the inflorescence acts either through modulating GA signal transduction itself or downstream of GA signalling. It would be interesting to determine whether changes in floral organ growth across the inflorescence also occur independently of DELLA-dependent signalling, for example in the <italic>gid1</italic> triple receptor mutant or the degradation-resistant DELLA mutant <italic>gai</italic>-<italic>1</italic> (Dill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>The recovery of <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> floral organ growth is associated with an implied late-stage developmental checkpoint</title><p id="Par41">Evidence presented in this study suggests that anther indehiscence in the earliest <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers is correlated with a severe reduction of stamen (and petal) growth not seen in flowers with dehiscent anthers at the same flower position. This effect is overlaid onto a gradient of stamen growth similar to that seen in wild type, albeit with a reduced initial stamen length. Anther indehiscence was previously described in early flowers of <italic>ga3ox</italic> GA biosynthesis mutants (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>), where stamen development apparently arrested late in flower development (stages 11 or 12). Stamen filament elongation primarily occurs in synchrony with anther maturation during late floral development, and stamen elongation in later <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> flowers is reduced at this stage (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>). The results of this study therefore support the existence of a GA-dependent, late-stage anther developmental block and further suggest a link, directly or indirectly, with late-stage stamen filament growth.</p><p id="Par42">Mechanisms linking anther development with filament elongation are currently unknown. The sharp difference in filament lengths between stamens with dehiscent and indehiscent anthers argues against GA itself acting to coordinate the two tissues: in this scenario the relationship between stamen length and GA concentration would be expected to be continuous (analogue). Supporting this is the observation that recent sensitive assays were unable to detect bioactive GA in wild-type petals at flower opening (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>). Furthermore, although their average growth was reduced across the early <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> inflorescence, growth of pistils and sepals was not affected in flowers with indehiscent anthers. An alternative candidate is the phytohormone jasmonate (JA): the JA biosynthetic mutant <italic>opr3</italic> displays arrested anther development and inhibited stamen filament elongation (Stintzi and Browse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2000</xref>). However, petal development is apparently unaffected in this mutant. In contrast, the JA biosynthesis mutant <italic>defective in anther dehiscence 1</italic> (<italic>dad1</italic>) demonstrates reduced growth of both stamens and petals during late floral development (Ishiguro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>). <italic>DAD1</italic> expression is restricted to the stamen filament during floral development (Ishiguro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>), where it is up-regulated by GA signalling (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>), although treatment with either of these hormones cannot entirely rescue floral phenotypes caused by deficiency of the other (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>), suggesting the requirement for other downstream signalling cascades.</p><p id="Par43">How <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> stamen development spontaneously overcomes this developmental block remains unclear, but presumably relates to changes in signalling along the early inflorescence. Although <italic>GA20ox3</italic> has been shown to be up-regulated in the <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> pistil and stamen filament (Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>), Hu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>) detected no difference in GA levels between early and late <italic>ga3ox</italic> mutant flowers displaying a similar phenotypic recovery, making it unlikely that <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox2</italic> stamen development recovers through direct changes in GA biosynthesis or signalling. Alternatively, pathways downstream of GA signalling might be modulated to promote continued development despite the absence of GA. Our results suggest that any such changes are likely to be located within the developing anther.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Novel roles for GA in floral patterning and stamen development</title><p id="Par44">
<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> floral development is considered to be a highly determinant, invariant programme of events generating a fixed number of floral organs in sequential, concentric whorls from a floral meristem (FM). Some of the regulatory mechanisms governing these events are already known (reviewed in Airoldi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Irish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>). However, we detected a significantly higher incidence of abnormal floral development in the first flowers to emerge compared to later flowers across all genotypes. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FMs are produced sequentially from the flanks of the inflorescence meristem (IM), in place of leaf primordia generated during the vegetative phase of development. The positions of lateral organ primordia are determined through auxin maxima in both the vegetative and reproductive phases, the positions of which are influenced by the positions of preceding primordia (Reinhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2003</xref>; Heisler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). Both leaf primordia and FMs are generated in a spiral phyllotaxy, the direction of which is not predetermined and which can change between developing inflorescences on the same plant (Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>). During the transition of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to IM identity, the apex increases in size and changes shape (Mishke and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1965</xref>). Development in the first FMs may thus be more plastic because they arise without pre-existing primordia of the same type to constrain developmental patterning.</p><p id="Par45">Exogenous GA treatment did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in the first flowers to develop but prolonged their occurrence into later flowering, suggesting that it is necessary to restrict GA signalling to stabilise early floral development. In support of this, we noticed that inflorescence phyllotaxy appeared disturbed in plants grown under GA treatment (Online Resource 4). The GA biosynthetic genes <italic>CPS</italic> and <italic>GA3ox1</italic> are both expressed in early FMs prior to the outgrowth of the floral organs (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). Until now no developmental functions have been ascribed to GA at this stage of floral development. The FM identity gene <italic>LEAFY</italic> (<italic>LFY</italic>) has been shown to restrict GA signalling through enhanced GA catabolism to trigger up-regulation of its downstream target <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>) via DELLA accumulation (Yamaguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>). Our analysis of floral abnormalities at the whole flower level suggested that imbalanced GA signalling across the FM, rather than GA signalling per se, triggers abnormal development. Two genotypes, <italic>ga20ox1</italic> and <italic>ga20ox1 ga20ox3</italic>, had apparently contradictory effects on the frequency of abnormalities as a result of influencing different developmental processes (short stamen homeosis and short stamen numbers, respectively). The expression patterns of the <italic>GA20ox</italic> paralogues have not been mapped within the early FM, but could cause localised differences in bioactive GA levels through regulating local availability of the GA3ox substrate GA<sub>9</sub>.</p><p id="Par46">We identified significant deviations in the numbers of floral organs produced under GA treatment. Changes to the number of organs that develop might reflect alterations to the relative sizes of the concentric whorls specified within the FM, either directly regulated by GA signalling or indirectly through a change in initial FM size: a larger FM could allow more sepals to arise at the periphery (as was found), the altered geometry subsequently affecting patterning in the later-developing inner whorls. The tendency towards loss of short stamens can also be explained by such a mechanism, as an outcome of their late emergence after the establishment of long stamens (Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1990</xref>). However, we did not find any clear correlation between changes in the number of organs across different whorls. Organ fusion events indicate defects in organogenesis beyond organ specification. Separate floral organ primordia are established within each whorl by the creation of boundaries between adjacent organs, comprised of specialised cell types (reviewed in Aida and Tasaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>). A number of transcription factors regulate stamen boundary formation, including <italic>CUP</italic>-<italic>SHAPED COTYLEDON1</italic> (<italic>CUC1</italic>) and <italic>CUC2</italic> (Aida et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>), <italic>FUSED FLORAL ORGANS1</italic> (<italic>FFO1</italic>), <italic>FFO2</italic> and <italic>FFO3</italic> (Levin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1998</xref>), <italic>UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO</italic>; Laufs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>) and <italic>HANABA TARANU</italic> (<italic>HAN</italic>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2004</xref>). Organ loss and/or stamen fusion has been observed in a number of mutants for these genes, and auxin signalling has been implicated as an organising factor (Furutani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2004</xref>). The changes in organ number and organ fusions observed in this study could arise through mis-regulation of these or other boundary genes in very early flowers and under exogenous GA treatment. Regulation by GA might be direct, or changes in size of the initial FM or whorl domain might result in indirect perturbations downstream.</p><p id="Par47">Abnormalities in floral organ development occurred most frequently in stamens. Similar stamen defects arise when auxin biosynthesis or polar auxin transport are disrupted (Cardarelli and Cecchetti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). Later stages of stamen development are heavily regulated by GA signalling (reviewed in Plackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>). Floral organ identity is specified through interactions of MADS-box genes following the ABCE model (reviewed in Irish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>): stamens are determined by interaction between the B class MADS-box genes <italic>PISTILLATA</italic> (<italic>PI</italic>) and <italic>APETALA3</italic> (<italic>AP3</italic>) and the C class gene <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> (<italic>AG</italic>). <italic>AP3</italic>, <italic>PI</italic> and <italic>AG</italic> are all known targets of GA signalling, either directly or via the GA downstream target <italic>LFY</italic> (Bl&#x000e1;zquez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1998</xref>; Wagner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1999</xref>;&#x000a0;Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2004</xref>). Prolonged <italic>AG</italic> expression during floral development is required to maintain stamen identity (Bowman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1991</xref>; Ito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>), and as well as being a downstream target of GA signalling, AG up-regulates <italic>GA3ox1</italic> (G&#x000f3;mez-Mena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2005</xref>). Stamens are converted to petals in <italic>ag</italic> loss-of-function mutants (Coen and Meyerowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1991</xref>) and GA treatment can also promote petal development in <italic>ap1</italic> and <italic>ap2</italic> homeotic mutant backgrounds (Okamuro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1997</xref>), where petals are converted to stamen identity. The homeotic short stamen phenotype observed here is presumably linked to GA-dependent changes in A, B or C gene expression, although mis-regulation of some boundary genes such as <italic>UFO</italic> can also lead to the formation of mosaic floral organ identities (Levin and Meyerowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1995</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">The analysis of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> early flowering presented here has thus identified new potential roles for GA signalling during the very early stages of floral development. The developmental plasticity demonstrated by the first flowers represents an excellent vehicle to better understand the regulation of these early development processes.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="Par49">ALP, PH, ST and ZAW designed research.
