Hybrid seed generated from heterosis utilization system has made a great contribution to food production. There are two well-known male sterility systems that have been developed for hybrid seed production: Cytoplasmic Male Sterile (CMS) and Photoperiod-Thermo-Sensitive Genic Male Sterile (PTGMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The PTGMS system is considered to be more efficient than the CMS system for hybrid seed production because it can greatly simplify the procedure of hybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The abnormality of the anther development is the main reason causing male sterility in plant. In flowering plants, anther development is an complex and precise biological process, including stamen meristem differentiation, generation of sporogenous cells and development of microspore mother cells, meiosis, microspore formation and maturation, and pollination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], in which microsporocytes develop into mature pollen grains followed by twice mitotic divisions. Orderly, meiosis also involves in a series of complicated molecular events, including meiotic recombination, chromosome synapsis, cell cycle control, and chromosome distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Meiotic recombination is one of the most important events during the early stage of meiosis, which is initiated by the generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To preserve genome integrity, cells have evolved several DSB repair mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Basically, eukaryotic organisms employ two main mechanisms to repair DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex activated early during spermatogenesis is an essential meiotic factor for HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The <italic>CAF1</italic> encoding a conserved subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex is vital to meiotic progression, loss function of which resulted in sterility by blocking germ cell development at the pachytene stage of meiosis I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Little is known about the roles of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and <italic>CAF1</italic> gene in plants. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a <italic>SMARCA3</italic>-Like chromatin remodeling factor regulates low-dosage UVB-dependent hypocotyl elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Loss-function of both <italic>AtCAF1a</italic> and <italic>AtCAF1b</italic> reduced expression of pathogenesis-related genes and was more susceptible to pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the biochemical and physiological role of the <italic>SMARCA</italic> factors and <italic>CAF1</italic> were rarely reported in meiotic progression of plant.</p><p id="Par28">Plant microRNAs are an abundance of non-coding 21&#x02013;24&#x000a0;nt small RNAs. They regulate the expression of target genes by post-transcriptional degradation or translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some conserved and classical miRNAs such as, miR156, miR159, miR160, miR164, miR167, miR396, miR5200, etc., were reported to be critical for reproductive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In maize, miR2118 and miR2275 were identified as the triggers for generating 21-nt and 24-nt reproductive phasiRNAs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which are primarily derived from <italic>PHAS</italic> loci of lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There are few reports about miRNA-mediated PTGMS in crops. In rice, phasiRNAs that were triggered by miR2118 and differentially accumulated in the panicles of Nongken 58S compared with its NIL line, especially under long-day conditions, caused male sterility of 58S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. miR167 and tasiRNA-ARF play roles in regulating the auxin-signaling pathway and possibly in response to cold stress, which linked with male sterility in the BS366, a thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines of wheat, during early phase of anther development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further study found that miR964 and miR2186 regulatory pathway may participate in wheat male fertility transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hence, it is of great application value and theoretical significance to explore the roles of miRNAs associated with the male sterility of PTGMS lines.</p><p id="Par29">As an autumn-sown crop in the Hubei province of China, normal sowing time of wheat is from late October to early November. The wheat 337S line shows a high degree of male sterility if sown before September 30 or after November 30 every year, and it is fertile if sown in late October to early November at the same location. Further studies have proven that 337S is a male sterile line that is sensitive to both long day-length/high temperature and short day-length/low temperature condition, but it is fertile at normal planting time. These characteristics indicated that the fertility change of 337S line is due to the thermo-light condition of its cultivated environment, and 337S is a novel bi-pole-photo-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (BP-PTGMS) line in wheat as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In order to explore the mechanism of male sterility in 337S line at short day-length/low temperature condition, we characterized the roles of miRNAs and their targets in BP-PTGMS of wheat, using high-throughput small RNA and degradome sequencing analyses. The results revealed that genome-wide difference of genes expression and abnormity of the meiotic DSBs repair might be the main reasons leading to failure of meiosis and male sterility in 337S. Our results provided new knowledge on miRNAs regulating the fate of reproductive cell during early meiosis progression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials and samples preparation</title><p id="Par30">Wheat line 337S was cultivated in the experimental field of Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei of China (N30&#x000b0;32&#x02032;and E114&#x000b0;20&#x02032;).

Each plot was 6&#x000a0;m long with three lines and inter-row spacing of 20&#x000a0;cm. During the anthesis developmental stages, young spikes of different lengths were recorded daily until flowering by measuring the space off lag leaf cushion and the length of the spike (without awn length) with scale ruler to confirm the pollen growth progress. The meiosis and microspore development process were observed using smear and squash techniques. The observation showed that the developmental progress of young spike in short day-length/low temperature was consistent with that of development in normal day-length/normal temperature condition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The anthers of SL were shorter than those of NN plants, and SL anthers showed a slight yellow discolouration at mononuclear pollen stage and late binuclear pollen stage, while the NN anthers remained green (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). However, there was no significant difference of the pistil filaments between NN and SL plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). Unlike the normally grain filling on NN spikes, no visibly filled grain on SL plants at the filling stage was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). To determine whether the SL plants could produce abnormal anthers leading to male sterility as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], spike lengths about 3.9&#x02013;4&#x000a0;cm, 4.5&#x02013;4.6&#x000a0;cm and 5&#x02013;5.1&#x000a0;cm corresponding to microspore mother cell stage (NN1/SL1) and meiosis stage (NN2/SL2, NN3/SL3) were collected from NN and SL plants for performing semi-thin sections, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Anthers transverse cross-section observation indicated that the anthers of SL1 plants developed normally until the microspore mother cell (MMC) stage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">k</xref>). Histological results showed that the obvious aberration of SL2 anther occurred during meiosis, around the prophase stage, in which meiotic cells degenerated and collapsed rapidly, whereas the meiotic cells of NN2 anthers remained normally development (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">m</xref>).
