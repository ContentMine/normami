Histone-based epigenetic mechanisms are important for regulating this undifferentiated state. Here we report the use of genetic and pharmacological experimental approaches to show that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell suspensions and calluses specifically repress some genes as a result of promoter DNA hypermethylation. We found that promoters of the <italic>MAPK12</italic>, <italic>GSTU10</italic> and <italic>BXL1</italic> genes become hypermethylated in callus cells and that hypermethylation also affects the <italic>TTG1</italic>, <italic>GSTF5</italic>, <italic>SUVH8</italic>, <italic>fimbrin</italic> and <italic>CCD7</italic> genes in cell suspensions. Promoter hypermethylation in undifferentiated cells was associated with histone hypoacetylation and primarily occurred at CpG sites. Accordingly, we found that the process specifically depends on MET1 and DRM2 methyltransferases, as demonstrated with DNA methyltransferase mutants. Our results suggest that promoter DNA methylation may be another important epigenetic mechanism for the establishment and/or maintenance of the undifferentiated state in plant cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of mature plant cells to regenerate a whole organism is probably the most remarkable growth attribute of plant cells that distinguishes them from mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0003306-Grafi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The basis of such a capacity in plants lies in the availability of undifferentiated cells that can subsequently differentiate into all the cell types present in a mature organism <xref rid="pone.0003306-Doerner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0003306-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The exact molecular processes involved in the maintenance and/or induction of cell undifferentiation in plants are still poorly understood.</p><p>In recent years, the epigenetic mechanisms that control chromatin structure and function, including DNA methylation and histone modification, have emerged as key factors in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and, thereby, the nuclear reprogramming necessary for dedifferentiation <xref rid="pone.0003306-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The presence of a well-defined DNA methylation pattern in plants is necessary for the normal growth and development of the organism <xref rid="pone.0003306-Lippman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0003306-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. DNA methylation in plants has two functions: to protect the genome by inactivating transposable elements, and to control the expression of single-copy genes, such as the FWA transcription factor, the BALL pathogen-resistance gene (<italic>BAL</italic>), and the phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (<italic>PAI</italic>) family of tryptophan biosynthesis genes (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0003306-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>). Recent pioneering reports <xref rid="pone.0003306-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0003306-Mathieu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> defining the DNA methylome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have reinforced the significance of the two aforementioned tasks of DNA methylation as an epigenetic marker in this model and its relevance as a central coordinator of epigenetic memory.</p><p>In mammals, promoter DNA methylation-dependent gene regulation has been found to have important roles in development and differentiation. This is exemplified by the observations that human embryonic stem cells have specific epigenetic signatures <xref rid="pone.0003306-Ohm1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0003306-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, many tissue-specific genes present promoter DNA methylation-dependent regulation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0003306-Fraga1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>), and finally, aberrant hypermethylation-mediated repression of genes involved in cell differentiation results in malignant transformation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0003306-Feinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Esteller1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). In plants, however, there is little information about DNA methylation-dependent mechanisms involved in the control of cell differentiation. Previous work in plants found that the loss of the differentiated state in protoplasts is accompanied by global changes in DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0003306-Avivi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Koukalova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and histone modification <xref rid="pone.0003306-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> that alter heterochromatin distribution and organization <xref rid="pone.0003306-Grafi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Grafi2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Grafi3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, chromatin decondensation <xref rid="pone.0003306-Koukalova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0003306-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and disrupt the nucleolus <xref rid="pone.0003306-Avivi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Intriguingly, a recent study found that protoplast dedifferentiation is accompanied by a dramatic centromeric heterochromatin decondensation that is not accompanied by changes in DNA methylation or H3K9 dimethylation <xref rid="pone.0003306-Tessadori1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. With respect to promoter DNA methylation in plants, however, undifferentiation has only been associated with the hypomethylation-dependent upregulation of a few members of the NAC (NAM/ATAF1/CUC2) domain family <xref rid="pone.0003306-Avivi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and there has been no report of genes whose repression by promoter hypermethylation contributes to the maintenance or establishment of the undifferentiated state. To address these gaps in our knowledge by looking for genes regulated by promoter methylation in undifferentiated cells, we adopted two experimental strategies: a genetic approach, using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells deficient in different members of the family of plant DNA methyltransferases, and a pharmacological approach, treating undifferentiated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell suspensions (ACS) with the demethylating drug 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (ADC), followed by expression microarray analysis in a similar way to that previously done in whole plants <xref rid="pone.0003306-Chan2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Using these approaches, we identified three and five hypermethylated genes in callus and cell suspensions, respectively. Promoter hypermethylation primarily occurred at CpG sites and specifically depended on MET1 and DRM2 methyltransferases. Our results suggest that promoter DNA methylation may be another important epigenetic mechanism for the establishment and/or maintenance of the undifferentiated state in plant cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of calluses from DNA methyltransferase KOs and culture conditions</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) ecotype Wassilewskija wild type and mutants (<italic>met1</italic>, <italic>cmt3</italic>, <italic>drm2</italic>, <italic>drm2 cmt3</italic>) were surface-sterilized and placed on agar tubes with 10 ml of germination medium containing MS basal medium (mineral salts, vitamins, and micronutrients), 3&#x00025; sucrose, 0.8&#x00025; agar, pH 5.8.

We used the U rank-statistic test, which ignores the magnitude of the expression values but distinguishes samples with higher and lower levels of expression. The statistic was determined for each comparison and genes with values of U&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 were selected. A fold-change value, given by the ratio of the means of the two comparison groups was calculated, and genes with at least twice the average expression in WT plants as in WT callus were selected. Second, from the selected genes, we picked those genes that were upregulated (according to the two-step criteria described above) in callus of each DNA methyltransferase mutant relative to the WT callus in order to associate gene regulation with a specific plant DNA methyltransferase. Third, of the candidate genes obtained under the previous criteria, we discarded those common to at least two mutants. Using these criteria we identified 96 genes for <italic>cmt3</italic>, 235 for <italic>drm2</italic>, 134 for the double mutant DKO, and, strikingly, 505 for the <italic>met1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003306-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This may be evidence of a role for MET1 methyltransferase in promoter hypermethylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> callus cells. The observation is also consistent with the fact that callus induction was less efficient using cells from the <italic>met1</italic> mutant. Callus from MET1 deficient cells presented low proliferation rates and maintained differentiation-associated features like green pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003306-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003306-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003306.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Promoter hypermethylation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> callus specifically depends on MET1 and DRM2 methyltransferase activity.</title><p>(A) Callus induction from DNA methyltransferases mutants. <italic>Upper panels</italic>, morphological aspect of entire plants grown from WT and DNA methyltransferase mutant seeds. <italic>Lower panels</italic>, growth rates of WT and mutant callus generated after treatment with 2,4-D of root explants.

In the present study we have demonstrated that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> calluses and cell suspensions can use promoter DNA methylation to repress specific single-copy genes that are unmethylated and expressed in differentiated cells from various origins. However, it is important to state that this epigenetic mechanism is not a general response to cell culture as just a minor fraction of the genes become hypermethylated in callus and cell suspensions.</p><p>We found that promoters of the <italic>MAPK12</italic>, <italic>GSTU10</italic> and <italic>BXL1</italic> genes are densely hypermethylated in callus and cell suspensions, whilst the <italic>TTG1</italic>, <italic>GSTF5</italic> and <italic>SUVH8</italic> genes become occasionally hypermethylated only in cell suspensions.

Thus, as TTG1 plays an important role in plant development, its methylation-dependent repression in undifferentiated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> could directly contributes to the manteinance of the undifferentiated status. However, it is important to bear in mind that although recovery of TTG1 activity in cell suspension results in a modest induction of cell differentiation (data not shown), our discovery of <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cells lacking <italic>TTG1</italic> promoter hypermethylation indicates that the regulation of <italic>TTG1</italic> in the establishment and/or maintenance of the undifferentiated state is a complex process that can sometimes include promoter DNA methylation.</p><p>Intriguingly, we found that promoter hypermethylation in cell suspensions and callus primarily occurs at CpG but not at CpNpG or CpNpN sites. The absence of CpNpG and CpNpN methylation at the promoter region of genes hypermethylated specifically in cell suspensions and callus suggests that the process depends primarily on the plant MET1 methyltransferase. This is consistent with the facts that <italic>Arabidopsis met1</italic> mutants are more resistant to producing callus than are control plants, and that the number of hypermethylated genes after callus induction that we identified by genetic identification was lower in MET1- and DRM2-deficient plants than in controls and <italic>cmt3</italic> mutants.

As MET1 is thought to be important in the silencing of repeated transposable elements <xref rid="pone.0003306-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, one possibility is that MET1 is specifically recruited to repeated DNA associated with its target promoters. Indeed, the five genes for which we found CpG hypermethylation by pharmacological identification contained TEs within 1 kb of the start codon, whereas only one gene (At3g44260) of the remaining eight selected had TE insertions at its 5&#x02032; end, suggesting the involvement of TEs in cell suspensions-associated methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003306-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Intriguingly, none of the genes identified by the genetic approach contained TE insertions around the transcription start point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003306-g005">Figure 5</xref>), which suggests that there may be different mechanisms by which DNA methylation is established in the various undifferentiated cells. However, as our study is centered in a limited number of genes, further genome-wide studies are need to asses this issue.

Further research is needed to determine the exact functional role of gene regulation by promoter DNA methylation during plant cell differentiation, and in the establishment and maintenance of the undifferentiated state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003306.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Bisulfite genomic sequencing of twelve individual clones of nine representative genes unmethylated in leaves and Arabidopsis wild type callus.
