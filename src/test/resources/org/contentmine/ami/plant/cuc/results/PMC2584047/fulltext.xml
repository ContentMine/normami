In Angiosperms, a gene called <italic>WUSCHEL </italic>(<italic>WUS</italic>) has been isolated from many different species. <italic>WUS </italic>was the first identified member of the <underline>W</underline>uschel-related homeob<underline>ox</underline> (<italic>WOX</italic>) subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] that is only found in plants.</p><p>The specific expression of the <italic>WOX </italic>genes in different plant organs and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] suggested an important role for them during organogenesis. The <italic>WUS </italic>gene is expressed in a restricted region of the meristem called the organizing centre located below the stem cells of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and functions non-cell autonomously to control the stem cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interestingly Gallois et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] showed recently that ectopic expression of WUS in the root establishes shoot stem cells and leaf development. Other members of the WOX family might also prevent premature cell differentiation in developing organs or tissues. Recently, WOX5 was shown to be involved in stem cell maintenance signaling in the root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Wu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have shown that WOX9 (Stimpy/STIP) prevents premature cell differentiation during organ growth, in addition to contributing positively to <italic>WUS </italic>expression. This work also revealed that <italic>stip </italic>mutants can be rescued by sucrose, a modulator of cell proliferation trough <italic>cyclin D </italic>induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Two other <italic>WOX </italic>genes, named Narrow Sheath 1 and 2, that are maize orthologues of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana AtWOX6 </italic>were shown to be involved in the recruitment of the lateral founder cells within the SAM prior to the primordia development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Last, Haecker et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] analyzed the expression dynamics of the <italic>WOX </italic>genes during <italic>A. thaliana </italic>embryo development and showed that members of the <italic>WOX </italic>family mark cell fate decisions during embryonic patterning. Taken together, these results suggest that not only <italic>WUS </italic>but several other <italic>WOX </italic>genes play a role in regulating cell division and preventing cell differentiation.</p><p>Characterized genomes of Angiosperms contain more than 10 different <italic>WOXs </italic>and phylogenetic studies suggest that the <italic>WOX </italic>family existed in the last common ancestor of monocots and core eudicots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A recent WOX phylogeny based on WOX HDs from different Angiosperms, the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens </italic>and the lycophyte <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii </italic>showed that all of the <italic>P. patens </italic>and eight of the <italic>S. moellendorffii WOX </italic>genes clustered in the same clade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, the phylogenetic analyses of a transcription factor family like WOX suffer from some limitations due to the relatively short length of the HD, which is the only conserved sequence between the WOX protein family members, and the relatively few land plant species with a completely characterized proteome. As a consequence, the patterns of phylogenic trees of large families of plant transcription factors are often weakly supported by statistics and may be affected by long branch attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, clade specific gene features and protein domains were observed in transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, in this study, we used clade specific signatures beyond the HD and clade specific conservation of intron insertion sites, to provide additional data in support of the orthology links predicted by the WOX phylogeny. In order to carry out the latter analyses, complete genome sequences with accurate structural annotations are essential. Our results strongly support the existence of a WOX13 orthologous group (WOX13 OG) that, contrary to the two other WOX OGs, contains genes from many different members of the plant kingdom, including basal species, and a branch apparently specific to Brassicaceae. To obtain information on the function of the genes belonging to the WOX13 clade, the cell specificity of At <italic>WOX13 </italic>and At <italic>WOX14 </italic>expression was established experimentally and phenotypes resulting from mutations within these two genes were characterized in the plant model <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>A WOX distance tree from model genomes</title><p>We carefully screened several completely sequenced eukaryote genomes for WOX genes, <italic>i.e.</italic>, two Angiosperms, <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and <italic>O. sativa</italic>, three algae, <italic>O. tauri</italic>, <italic>O. lucimarinus </italic>and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii </italic>and two yeasts, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. No <italic>WOX </italic>genes were identified outside of the plant kingdom and <italic>Ostreococcus </italic>revealed only one WOX gene per genome. Moreover, using the HMMsearch tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we found only one HD gene in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, 2 in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, 4 in <italic>O. tauri </italic>and 8 in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>compared to the 92 HD genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p><p>Distance and phylogenic trees were computed from the HD sequences of the WOX proteins from the five plant model genomes, <italic>O. tauri</italic>, <italic>P. patens, S. moellendorffii</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and <italic>O. sativa </italic>(see method section). The clustering of the WOX proteins in 3 different OGs were consistent using either the Neighbor-Joining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) or the Maximum likelihood (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure 1) methods and different outgroups. The topology of the trees clearly showed three different OGs namely the WOX1, WOX8 and WOX13 MOGs (for Model plant OG). Each OG contained rice and Arabidopsis proteins, but the single WOX protein of <italic>O. tauri</italic>, the three <italic>P. patens </italic>and the three <italic>S. Moellendorffii </italic>WOX proteins were all found in the same group, the WOX13 MOG. The WOX1 MOG contained AtWOX1-7 and AtWUS, the WOX8 OG associated AtWOX8, 9, 11 and 12 and the WOX13 OG included AtWOX10, 13 and 14. Thus, the previous observation of the presence of the <italic>P. patens </italic>proteins only in the WOX13 OG group was extended to <italic>O. tauri </italic>and <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>. However, the introduction of OtWOX and the SmWOXs did not change the main branching of the trees nor significantly modified the bootstrap values at the internal node of the tree. The 14 available <italic>WOX </italic>sequences from different Gymnosperms were distributed between the three OGs (data not shown). Furthermore, the trees we obtained were not consistent with the phylogenetic tree of plant species as it is now known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus the WOX trees we produced suggest probably several rounds of gene deletions in <italic>O. tauri </italic>and <italic>P. patens </italic>in order to explain the branching of the WOX13 OG. The finding that all the WOX sequences of <italic>O. tauri </italic>and <italic>P. patens</italic>, as well as those of <italic>S. moellendorffii </italic>were clustered in the WOX13 OG suggested to us that <italic>AtWOX10, 13, 14 </italic>might represent the most interesting genes to study the functional diversification of the WOX genes although they are the WOX genes for which we have the least functional information (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). This prompted us to look at the specificity of the WOX13 OG with regards to gene structure and conserved amino acid signatures other than the HD. Conservation in gene structure is an indication of a common ancestor while conserved amino acid signatures are linked to functions such as protein-protein interactions or regulatory sites.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>WOX </italic>genes from model plant genomes</bold>.

Alignments supporting the conservation of intron insertion sites are given in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure 2. The organization of the gene structures along the phylogeny tree did not reveal any contradiction between gene structures and tree pattern. Intron site conservations were exclusively observed within each of the three OGs and never between them. In this context, it was interesting to observe that the insertion site of the first intron in <italic>AtWOX13 </italic>is conserved in almost all the genes (from moss to Angiosperms) belonging to the WOX13 OG. The only exception was <italic>PpaWOX03</italic>, a possible pseudogene (see below). This observation cannot be extended to <italic>O. tauri </italic>as its genes do not have introns. <italic>S. moellendorffii </italic>genes have introns and the three full-length <italic>SmWOXs </italic>have one conserved intron insertion site downstream from the WOX13 motif. The latter intron of <italic>SmWOXs </italic>is in a similar position (relative to the coding region) to the first highly conserved intron of WOX13 OG genes in moss and Angiosperms. Nevertheless, there is no trace of amino acid sequence conservation in the corresponding protein region between <italic>S. moellendorffii </italic>and the other genes in the WOX13 OG (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table 3). When taken together, our analyses of intron insertion sites support the boundaries of the WOX13 OG as defined by phylogeny. In addition to the highly conserved intron upstream of the HD coding sequence found in the WOX13 OG, <italic>AtWOX10 </italic>and <italic>AtWOX14 </italic>share another conserved intron insertion site downstream of the HD while <italic>OS01G60270 </italic>and <italic>AtWOX13 </italic>share a different intron insertion site in the 3' region of the gene. The tree pattern implies first a loss of the orthologues of <italic>AtWOX10 </italic>and <italic>14 </italic>in <italic>O. sativa </italic>and in <italic>P. patens </italic>and secondly that <italic>AtWOX13 </italic>and <italic>OS01G60270 </italic>are orthologous. Interestingly, the two latter genes share a specific intron insertion site.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific motifs in the WOX proteins</title><p>A search for specific motifs other than the HD used to build the distance and phylogeny trees led us to identify HMMs that were specific to each clade and located either within the N or the C terminal regions of the different proteins. These HMMs are illustrated by sequence logos (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure 3) and by alignments (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure 4). Only proteins of the WOX1 clade have a small motif of 10 amino acids (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the TLxLFP motif) in the C-terminal region, but at relatively variable distances from the HD. TLxLFP has previously been described as a characteristic motif of WUS proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but we show here that it is common to the entire WOX1 clade, <italic>i.e.</italic>, it is observed not only in WUS, but also in the AtWOX1-7 proteins. However, the WUS proteins of <italic>A. thaliana </italic>(AT2G17950-AtWUS) and <italic>O. sativa </italic>(OS04G56780) share specific features not observed in any of the other proteins of the WOX1 MOG. Indeed, they display 1) the LELxL WUS motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] known as EAR-like or ERF-like motifs that are located in the outmost C-terminal region, similar to a motif found in potent transcriptional repressors in plants <italic>i.e.</italic>, Superman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Aux/IAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; 2) the same intron exon structure in the coding regions of each gene; and 3) an additional amino acid at a conserved position in the homeodomain.</p><p>Nearly all proteins of the WOX8 MOG contain two contiguous motifs of 30 amino acids situated near to their C-terminus (<italic>i.e.</italic>, VFIN-WOX8 and LQxG-WOX8 MOG motifs). The latter motifs are surrounded by two conserved introns. Remarkably, these introns are also found in OS05G48990 in which the VFIN-WOX8 MOG motif is replaced by a non-conserved sequence of a similar length.</p><p>All the proteins of the WOX13 MOG, except for PpaWOX03, share a 39 amino acid motif that is found upstream from the HD and named the WOX13 MOG motif. This observation provides further support for the validity of the WOX13 OG as defined by phylogeny and to the hypothesis of a specific function of the genes clustered within. For all of these reasons, it was decided to investigate further the WOX13 clade.</p></sec><sec><title>WOX13 OG distance tree</title><p>Thirty three full length WOX proteins were used to reconstruct the distance tree of the WOX13 clade (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), using OtWOX as the outgroup. The neighbor-joining tree showed two main branches. The first branch contained all of the Gymnosperm and the moss WOXs. The second branch contained AtWOX13 together with many Angiosperm sequences. This branch was further separated into two branches, one contained AtWOX13 and many proteins from different Angiosperms while the second contained AtWOX10, AtWOX14 and a <italic>Brassica rapa </italic>sequence.</p><p>The preferential presence of amino acid motifs fully supported the separation of the different gene groups within the trees. Obviously, all proteins of the WOX13 clade displayed the WOX HD and the WOX13 motif. Moreover, we also identified specific motifs for the AtWOX10, 14 and for the AtWOX13 branches (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure 3). All Angiosperm proteins located inside the WOX13 OG shared two motifs, the YxDpl-WOX13 motif located between the WOX13 MOG motif and the HD, and the ESExE-WOX13 motif just downstream from the HD. The monocots of the AtWOX13 branch also share a specific motif called the monocot-WOX13 motif that was detected also in two other partial proteins of two monocotyledon species.</p><p>Proteins of the AtWOX10, 14 branch shared two specific motifs, the YFdPM-WOX10 and QAdDaAVTT-WOX10 motifs. They were located to the same region of the protein as the YxDpl-WOX13 and ESExE-WOX13 motifs, respectively. Hence, the similarity between the YFdPM-WOX10 OG and YxDpl-WOX13 motifs suggested a common origin. Partial protein sequences from <italic>Brassica oleracea </italic>and <italic>Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. raphanistrum </italic>(protein sequence derived from the two ESTs, gb|EX762111| and gb|EX766460|) confirmed the specificity of the motifs to Brassicaceae. Thus, the AtWOX14 containing branch appears to be Brassicaceae specific since: 1) all the sequences containing the two AtWOX10, 14 motifs are from Brassicaceae and 2) no species other than those belonging to the Brassicaceae displayed any of these two motifs.</p><p>The Gymnosperm and moss branch contained proteins that shared the ESExE-WOX13 OG motif with the Angiosperm WOX13 proteins, located at the same position relative to the HD. They also shared two other motifs specific to this branch: 1) the LxxGQ-gymnosperm/moss-WOX OG motif that was at the same position as the YxDpl-WOX13 OG or YFdPM-WOX10 OG motifs and 2) a supplementary motif in the C-terminal region of the proteins.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The WOX13 Orthology Group</bold>.

Hence, the late flowering phenotype observed in the <italic>wox14 </italic>mutant might reflect a default in the coordination of cell division and elongation in the transitional SAM. In contrast, the <italic>wox13 </italic>mutant line showed a surprising early floral transition. However, a chimeric <italic>WOX13 </italic>mRNA coding for a putative protein containing the conserved domains was expressed in the <italic>wox13 </italic>193G10 line. We suggest that this line might act as a dominant negative mutant that induces early floral transition by activating precocious cell proliferation in the SAM. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that other WOX family members could fulfill the function of the AtWOX13 protein, leading to a weak phenotype in the Arabidopsis mutant background. To date, the mechanism underlying gene regulation by the homeobox gene family is complex and remains largely unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. A monitoring of the promoter activity during the floral transition and an analysis of a mutant line with an insertion upstream of the HD or an RNAi strategy should give us better insights into the function of the WOX13 protein.</p><p>Finally, we found that the <italic>wox14 </italic>null mutant showed root growth delay and early anther maturation. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was also observed in anthers when cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were ectopically expressed in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the AtWOX14 protein is involved in the negative control of cell differentiation to allow for correct development.</p><p>In a similar way, the expression profile observed during the gametophytic development of <italic>P. patens </italic>is consistent with a putative function in cell differentiation control during the filamentous growth and the bud formation although <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization experiment are needed to validate this hypothesis. Last, the constitutive expression of the only <italic>WOX </italic>gene in <italic>O. tauri </italic>may account for its maintenance in an undifferentiated state. Future use of <italic>O. tauri </italic>and <italic>P. patens </italic>as biological models and ongoing complementation experiments of mutants using either full length or truncated proteins should allow us to obtain a better understanding of the functional importance of the WOX13 OG genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data provide evidence in favor of the WOX13 OG as the clade containing the most conserved WOX genes. The preferential presence of amino acid motifs fully supports the separation of the different gene groups in the phylogenetic trees. However, the latter is not consistent with the green plant phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In this study, we linked the function of the WOX13OG Arabidopsis members to organ initiation and development, most likely by preventing premature differentiation as shown for other WOX proteins. The data also suggest that the WOX family has diverged both at the transcriptional and protein level to generate new features that control cell identity in specific domains of land plants. In line with such evolutionary events, the expression profile and mutant phenotype of the <italic>AtWOX14 </italic>gene suggest that the Brassicaceae might have developed specific mechanisms to control floral transition and pollen formation when compared to other plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of WOX genes</title><p>The identification of <italic>WOX </italic>genes was undertaken using model plants for which the complete genome was available, <italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana </italic>(a core eudicot), <italic>O. sativa </italic>(a monocot), <italic>P. patens </italic>(a moss) and <italic>O. tauri </italic>(a green alga).

Gene and protein sequences of the WOX families from completely sequenced genomes of model species are given (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table 1).

Using the WOX-HD HMM (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table 2), we found 8 WOX sequences, but only 3 were apparently full-length.

To assess support for the calculated relationships, 1000 bootstrap samples were generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. To select appropriate outgroups for the WOX model plant phylogeny, we first established a tree using all of the HD proteins from <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and 3 outgroups (<italic>i.e.</italic>, At3G03260, At4G00730, At4G17710) were chosen from the three clades closest to the WOX clade.

A gapped alignment using CLUSTALW was generated for each motif. Based on these multiple alignments a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was built using HMMER 2.3.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The HMM was used to search for motifs in the WOX sequences from the model genomes and in the whole proteome in GenBank NR (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table 2). The sequence logos were made using Weblogo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].

Using the WOX HD HMMs, an initial search in these two novel proteomes allowed us to specifically retrieve all members of the WOX gene family. A second search with the clade specific HMMs efficiently clustered the WOX genes into one of the three WOX clades (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table 3). We found 13 different Vitis genes coding for WOX proteins, with 8 located in the WOX1 OG, 3 in the WOX13 OG, and 2 in the WOX8 OG.
