However, comparison of curvature for clarification of gene function can be difficult without a quantitative measurement of curvature. Here, a novel method for classification and quantification of leaf curvature is reported. Twenty-two mutant alleles from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants and transgenic lines deficient in leaf flatness were selected. The mutants were classified according to the direction, axis, position, and extent of leaf curvature. Based on a global measure of whole leaves and a local measure of four regions in the leaves, the curvature index (CI) was proposed to quantify the leaf curvature. The CI values accounted for the direction, axis, position, and extent of leaf curvature in all of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants grown in growth chambers. Comparison of CI values between mutants reveals the spatial and temporal variations of leaf curvature, indicating the strength of the mutant alleles and the activities of the corresponding genes. Using the curvature indices, the extent of curvature in a complicated genetic background becomes quantitative and comparable, thus providing a useful tool for defining the genetic components of leaf development and to breed new varieties with leaf curvature desirable for the efficient capture of sunlight for photosynthesis and high yields.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>auxin response</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>curvature index</kwd><kwd>leaf</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>mutants</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leaf morphogenesis, particularly the roles of polarity, cell division, and auxin response, in the genesis of plant form has long been a focus of study. In contrast to indeterminate shoot apical meristems, leaves of higher plants are determinate in development. The leaf primordium originates from the flank of the shoot apical meristem and is dorsoventrally symmetrical and flattened on its adaxial side. Upon formation of the blades, the three-dimensional leaf form is specified along the proximodistal (base-to-tip), dorsoventral (top-to-bottom), and mediolateral (middle-to-margin) axes. Polarity along the three axes is associated with cell cycle activities in the marginal meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Donnelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and with movements of the arrest front of cell division in the leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Coordination of polarity, cell division, and auxin response is critical for morphogenesis of normal leaves and for plant architecture. An imbalance of these developmental processes results in altered leaf shapes, such as curly, crinkly, twisted, rolled, or shrunken leaves. In recent years, mutants with different curvatures have been isolated and described (Serrano-Cartagena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000), and various molecular reasons have been identified.</p><p>Mutant plants deficient in polarity, cell division, and the auxin response exhibit abnormal leaf curvature. Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip III) genes are targets of miR165/166. Of these, <italic>PHABULOSA</italic> (<italic>PHB</italic>), <italic>PHAVOLUTA</italic> (<italic>PHV</italic>), and <italic>REVOLUTA</italic> (<italic>REV</italic>) act redundantly to promote the adaxial cell fates of the leaf primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McConnell and Barton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McConnell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Dominant mutations in the <italic>Arabidopsis PHB</italic> and <italic>PHV</italic> transcription factor genes switch the leaf fate from abaxial to adaxial by altering a microRNA (miRNA) complementary site present in processed <italic>PHB</italic> or <italic>PHV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McConnell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The alternating leaf polarity is related to the interruption of miRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>REV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). <italic>ATHB8</italic> (<italic>HB-8</italic>) and <italic>CORONA</italic> (<italic>CNA</italic>) encode functions that are antagonistic to those of <italic>REV</italic> within certain tissues and overlap with those of <italic>REV</italic> in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Prigge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; Green <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The <italic>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDIA/PCF</italic> (<italic>TCP</italic>) family contains five miR319a targets, which are the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologues of the <italic>Antirrhinum CINCINNATA</italic> (<italic>CIN</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The TCP transcription factors play a pivotal role in the control of morphogenesis of shoot organs by negatively regulating the expression of boundary-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>ARF10</italic>, <italic>ARF16</italic>, and <italic>ARF17</italic> are the three targets of miR160. Plants expressing <italic>mARF17</italic> or <italic>mARF16</italic> have incurved leaves, corresponding to increased <italic>ARF17</italic> or <italic>ARF16</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mallory <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>miR165/166, miR319a, and miR160 are implicated in the development of plant forms by regulation of polarity, cell division, or auxin response through target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel and Bartel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones-Rhoades <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Mutation of these <italic>MIRNA</italic> and target genes causes different types and extents of leaf curvature. Some attempts to uncover the function of the individual genes have been made by analysis of the direction, axis, position, and extent of curvature in mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Prigge and Clark, 2006</xref>). To date, a number of mutant alleles with curved leaves have been reported. However, comparison of curvature between mutants is difficult in many cases when measurement of leaf curvature is not quantitative. The lack of a quantitative measurement of curvature prevents the accurate assessment of the severity of mutation and the genes involved in the development of plant forms. Several attempts to quantify leaf curvature have been made. For example, Gaussian curvature has been described to account for the excessive growth in leaf margins of <italic>cincinnata</italic> (<italic>cin</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The ratio of the unflattened width to the width of the flattened leaves has been used to indicate the difference in leaf curvature between <italic>poltergeist-like5</italic> (<italic>pll5</italic>) and <italic>pll4</italic> mutants in one direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Song and Clark, 2005</xref>), and the transverse curvature index (TC) and longitudinal curvature index (LC) were defined to measure leaf curvature of <italic>hyl1</italic> mutants according to the distance between the lateral margins of curved leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Despite these advances in quantitative measurement of leaf curvature in a few specific mutants, quantitative comparisons of different types of leaf curvature have not been possible.</p><p>Leaves can curve along two axes, the mediolateral axis (middle-to-margin) for transverse curvature and the proximodistal axis (base-to-tip) for longitudinal curvature. In many cases, curvature appears only in some regions of a blade, and simple measurements of leaf length and width cannot account for the extent of curvature. In this study, the formula of the curvature index (CI) is proposed in order to provide a quantitative measure of leaf curvature for all mutants and plant genotypes. Importantly, CI values were able to reveal differences in direction, axis, position, and extent of leaf curvature between the 22 mutants examined, indicating the severity of mutant alleles or transgenic plants. This formula works well for quantitative measurement of leaf curvature of mutants deficient in leaf flatness and is helpful for understanding the roles of the genes functional in plant development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>The <italic>hyl1</italic> seed sample was obtained from Dr Fedoroff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), the <italic>dcl1-9</italic>, <italic>jba-1D</italic>, and <italic>phb-6 phv-5 rev-9/+</italic> seed samples were from Dr Fletcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), the <italic>rev-6</italic> seed sample was from Dr Clark (Prigge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006), the <italic>oe-160c</italic>, <italic>ARF16::5mARF16</italic>, and <italic>arf10-2 arf16-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) seed samples were from Dr Chen, the <italic>jaw-1D</italic> seed sample was from Dr Weigel, and the <italic>TCP3SRDX</italic> seed sample was from Dr Ohme-Takagi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).

The <italic>dcl1-9</italic> leaves contained an apical upwardly curved region, the <italic>jba-1D</italic> leaves had a lateral downwardly curved region, and the <italic>jaw-1D</italic> leaf was characterized by a central upwardly curved region. In many cases, global and local curvature was mixed in one leaf. For example, <italic>jaw-1D</italic> leaves globally curved downward along the transverse axis. Their apical regions curved downward, whereas their central regions curled upward. In this type of leaf, global and local measures can be used separately to describe the different types of the curved regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Global measure of leaf curvature</title><p>A curved leaf is in the metric state. In three-dimensional space, leaves may exhibit double and multiple curvatures and may be twisted and ruffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A&#x02013;D</xref>). To quantify leaf curvature, the origin of the curved lines was described instead of the curved surface. When a curved leaf is transversely cut so that the cross-section is approximately a curved line (arc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>), the straight distance between the two points <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> on two lateral margins of the leaf is the length of the chord (a straight line joining two points on a arc). The distance between <italic>a</italic>&#x02032; and <italic>b</italic>&#x02032; on the two lateral margins after leaf flattening is the length of the arc. The arc length <italic>a</italic>&#x02032;<italic>b</italic>&#x02032; and chord length <italic>ab</italic> can be determined by measuring the distance between two lateral margins before and after leaf flattening. Some cuts and folds are introduced to allow for the wavy edge to be flattened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Based on a previously described formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), the CI in the downward direction (positive curvature) was defined as CI<sub>d</sub>=(<italic>a</italic>&#x02032;<italic>b</italic>&#x02032;&#x02013;<italic>ab</italic>)/<italic>ab</italic>, where <italic>ab</italic> is the chord length, the distance between points <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> on two margins of curvature before flattening of leaves, and <italic>a</italic>&#x02032;<italic>b</italic>&#x02032; is the arc length, the distance between <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> on two margins after flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Accordingly, CI in the upward direction (negative curvature) is CI<sub>u</sub>=(<italic>ab&#x02013;a</italic>&#x02032;<italic>b</italic>&#x02032;)/<italic>ab</italic>. When a leaf curves downward, the CI<sub>d</sub> value is positive; when it curves upward, the CI<sub>u</sub> value is negative. The CI is almost zero for a flat leaf. Meanwhile, the CI values along the transverse and longitudinal axes were designated as CI<sup>t</sup> and CI<sup>l</sup>, respectively. In contrast to the previously described formula, this method is capable of accounting for the direction, axis, and position of leaf curvature rather than just the extent of curvature. Using this formula, the CI values of all 22 mutants with curved leaves were calculated.</p><p>Most of the mutant and transgenic lines were characterized with global curvature. In addition, local curvature was also common. In the <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>dcl1</italic>, and <italic>se</italic> mutants, miRNA-directed gene silencing was abolished or diminished. To link the function of HYL1, DCL1, and SE to the phenotypes of each mutant, the leaf phenotypes of the <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>dcl1</italic>, and <italic>se</italic> mutants were compared. The <italic>hyl1</italic> leaves were smaller and narrower than the wild-type leaves, curved upward in a transverse direction, and were often helically rotated; the leaves of <italic>dcl1-9</italic> were round and basically flat in the transverse direction, and bent upwards at the tip; and the leaves of <italic>se-1</italic> plants were curved upward with serrated margins. CIs in the transverse axis (transverse CI) of <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>dcl1-9</italic>, and <italic>se-1</italic> leaves were &#x02013;0.46, &#x02013;0.03, and &#x02013;0.25, respectively, while the CI values along the longitudinal axis of <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>se-1</italic>, and <italic>dcl1-9</italic> were +0.08, +0.02, and &#x02013;0.03, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

In the <italic>dcl1-9</italic> leaves, significant upward curvature of apical regions was observed, while curvature in other regions was subtle. The distinct phenotypes of the <italic>hyl1</italic> and <italic>dcl1-9</italic> leaves revealed that the lack of HYL1 function affects the dorsoventral dimension of leaves in the transverse direction, whereas the loss of DCL1 function causes a distinct phenotype in the leaf apical region.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Curvature indices (CIs) of the mutant leaves along the transverse (A) and longitudinal (B) axes.

Some mutants were characterized with local curvature of leaves even though the whole leaves curved in a different direction. Because it was helpful to use a definition of local curvature that could be evaluated at all locations along a curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Silk and Erickson, 1978</xref>), the CI of global curvature was applied to local curvature.

The apical transverse and longitudinal CI values were calculated to be +0.07 and +0.36, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, B), indicating that a large &#x02018;global curvature&#x02019; assessed by the ratio method could be produced by a large curvature in a small region.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Curvature indices (CIs) of local regions from leaves on different nodes and at different stages.

For example, <italic>HYL1</italic> has three hypomorphic mutant alleles: <italic>hyl1</italic> (Ds transposon inserted in the second exon), <italic>hyl1-2</italic> (T-DNA in the second exon), and <italic>hyl1-3</italic> (CS875048) (T-DNA in the third exon).

The BLW ratio of the <italic>hyl1</italic> mutants was 3.01, which is much higher than that of the <italic>dcl1-9</italic> mutants but lower than that of the <italic>se-1</italic> mutants, indicating that the <italic>hyl1</italic> blades are significantly narrower than the <italic>dcl1-9</italic> blades. Meanwhile, the PBL ratios of the <italic>hyl1</italic> and <italic>se-1</italic> mutants were also significantly different.

However, within the population of the <italic>35S:HYL1</italic> transgenic plants, some plants had rosette leaves that curved less than those of the <italic>hyl1</italic> mutants, indicating that they were partially rescued. The <italic>35S::HYL1</italic> plants were classified into three categories: R1, completely rescued leaves (CI= +0.10 to &#x02013;0.10); R2, partially rescued leaves (CI= &#x02013;0.10 to &#x02013;0.30), and R3, weakly rescued leaves (CI= &#x02013;0.31 to &#x02013;0.90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>).

If marginal regions grow more slowly than the centre, the disc will adopt a cupped shape that has a positive Gaussian curvature. Conversely, if the marginal areas grow more rapidly than the centre, the disc will buckle to form a shape with a wavy edge, such as a saddle, with negative Gaussian curvature. <italic>Antirrhinum cin</italic> mutants have wavy edges owing to more rapid growth of the marginal areas. In the absence of the <italic>PPD</italic> (<italic>PEAPOD</italic>) genes, lamina tissue of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> outgrows the extension capacity of the marginal cells, changing the blade from flat to dome-shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">White, 2006</xref>). In these cases, Gaussian curvature can account for the extent of curvature, as it indicates the excessive growth in the leaf margins. However, unlike the <italic>cin</italic> and <italic>ppd</italic> mutants, most of the mutants (such as <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>se-1</italic>, <italic>rev-6</italic>, and <italic>TCP4::7mTCP4</italic> plants) deficient in leaf flatness do not exhibit excessive growth in the leaf margins. An attempt was made to assess the extent and location of curvature in these mutants using equations of Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature over the leaf surface. Unfortunately, these techniques did not work for the curvature since the values calculated in this way were not consistent with the actual direction and extent of leaf curvature. In curved leaves, the growth rate differed in different parts of the adaxial and abaxial sides, leading to downward and upward curvature and twisted edges. Usually, downward and upward curvature leads to a cylindrical shape; Gaussian curvature is rarely used to quantify this type of curvature. However, the growth rate of the wavy leaves varied greatly in different regions along the edges. The leaf perimeter (<italic>P</italic>) was measured relative to total leaf area (<italic>A</italic>) of the first and sixth blade in the wild type and the <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>rev-6</italic>, and <italic>jaw-d</italic> mutants. Surprisingly, these leaves have nearly the same perimeter-to-area ratios. Significant changes of the perimeter-to-area ratios were observed only in the <italic>jaw1-1D</italic> and <italic>TCP3SRDX</italic> mutants, which both have a wavy leaf edge with negative Gaussian curvature. Therefore, Gaussian curvature is more suitable for describing the curvature of leaves with inhomogeneous growth in different small regions but not for curved leaves with homogeneous growth (e.g. <italic>hyl1</italic>). Nevertheless, the CI is capable of describing the direction, axis, position, and extent of all types of curvature.</p><p>The ratio of the unflattened width to the width of the flattened leaves is used for simple comparison of the extent to which different plant genotypes have curved leaves in one direction (Song and Clarck, 2005). However, leaf curvature occurs in two directions: upward and downward. In some cases, curvature appears only in local regions of the blade. Simple measurement of the distance between the margins of leaves does not account for the local curvature. In contrast, the CI value can quantify the local curvature in different types of curved leaves.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the CI reveals the roles of the genes that function in plant development</title><p>Leaf morphogenesis has long been investigated for its relationship to polarity, cell division, and auxin response in the genesis of the leaf form. Originating from the flank of the shoot apical meristem, the leaf primordium is dorsoventrally symmetrical and flattened on its adaxial side. Upon the formation of blades, the three-dimensional form of leaves is specified along the proximodistal (base-to-tip), dorsoventral (top-to bottom), and mediolateral (middle-to-margin) planes. Three-dimensional polarity is associated with cell cycle activities in the marginal meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Donnelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and with a movement of the arrest front of cell division in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Coordination of polarity and cell division is critical for the morphogenesis of normal leaves and successful plant architecture. An imbalance within these developmental processes can result in curly, crinkly, twisted, rolled, or shrunken leaves.</p><p>In many cases, leaf curvature is associated with altered activity of the genes controlling leaf adaxial/abaxial polarity. The recessive <italic>phantastica</italic> (<italic>phan</italic>) mutant in snapdragons, which is the first leaf polarity mutant, possesses radially symmetric leaves with abaxial character around their circumference (Waites and Hudson, 1995). <italic>REV</italic>, <italic>PHB</italic>, <italic>PHV</italic>, and <italic>CNA</italic> regulate adaxial/abaxial polarity and asymmetry. Measurement of leaf curvature using the CI indicated that the mutant alleles of these adaxial/abaxial genes cause different types of leaf curvature. The loss-of-function mutants <italic>phv</italic>, <italic>phb</italic>, and <italic>rev-6</italic> displayed flatness or downward curvature of leaves, and the CI values were <italic>rev-6</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>rev-9</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>phb-6</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>phv-5</italic>, indicating that the contribution of the mutant alleles from strongest to weakest was <italic>rev-6</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>rev-9</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>phb-6</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>phv-5</italic>. Among them, <italic>rev-6</italic> and <italic>rev-9</italic> are hypomorphic alleles, and the higher CI of <italic>rev-6</italic> supports its stronger effect on leaf curvature.</p><p>In most cases, leaf curvature is irregular. Several regions in a curved leaf may curve in various directions to different extents. If a global measure is used to quantify the curvature, the resultant CI may be questionable and biased. If a local measure is used to calculate the CI of a local region, the resultant CI should be precise and suitable to assess the function of the mutant genes. For the <italic>jba-1D</italic> mutants, global and local measures generated different CI values: the longitudinal global CI was low (&#x02013;0.03), whereas the local CI for the apical regions was especially high (&#x02013;0.78). There is a 26-fold difference between these values. Compared with the global curvature, the local curvature is more accurate and the genetic effect of a mutant allele is more obvious. The curvature of <italic>jaw-1D</italic> is complicated to describe as different types of local curvature occur in one leaf. Under a global measure, the CI value of whole <italic>jaw-1D</italic> leaves was positive along the longitudinal axis. For a local measure, the CI value of the apical regions along the longitudinal axis and lateral regions in the transverse axis were extremely high because of the significant downward curvature and the downwardly rolled leaf margins, highlighting the excessive growth in the leaf margins. To define the identity of these curved regions, a local measure could be used to calculate the CI of each region.</p><p>Compared with the <italic>jaw-1D</italic> leaves, <italic>35S::TCP3SRDX</italic> leaves curve to a low extent, although the five <italic>TCP</italic> genes targeted by miR319a were down-regulated in both mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Palatnik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the relative CI values of the four local regions showed different patterns: the longitudinal CI of the apical region in <italic>jaw-1D</italic> mutants was similar to that of the <italic>35S::TCP3SRDX</italic> plants; the transverse CI of lateral regions in the <italic>jaw-1D</italic> mutants was much higher than that of the <italic>35S::TCP3SRDX</italic> plants. This difference reveals that the effect of the <italic>jaw-1D</italic> allele on local curvature is distinct from that of the <italic>35S::TCP3SRDX</italic> construct. In this example, the extent of digital curvature of the local regions was very useful for identifying differences in the same types of leaf curvature between mutants.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis asymmetric leaves1</italic> (<italic>as1</italic>) is a classical mutation that disrupts the development of cotyledons, leaves, and floral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and is an example of basal leaf curvature. In <italic>as1</italic> leaves, apical regions curve slightly downward along the transverse and longitudinal axes, whereas the basal regions curve significantly upward, leading to lotus-like leaves. <italic>asymmetric leaves2</italic> (<italic>as2</italic>) is another mutant deficient in leaf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Serrano-Cartagena <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and is characterized by very similar lotus-like leaves. Double mutations in <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 1</italic> (<italic>CUC1</italic>) and <italic>CUC2</italic> cause a lack of an embryonic SAM (shoot apical meristem) and a nearly complete fusion of the cotyledons; notably, each single mutant is basically normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Cotyledons of <italic>cuc1 cuc2</italic> mutants are unique, as they curve completely upward along the transverse axis with a transverse CI of &#x02013;1.0.</p><p>When the difference in direction and extent of leaf curvature between mutants is large enough, visual investigation is possible. When the difference is small or subtle, numerical representation is very useful. In many cases, the mutants of several genes are similar in the phenotypes of curvature, and visual observation relies on the ability and skill of the observer and thus is not certain. Nevertheless, the subtle difference among these mutants could be defined by their CI values. Secondly, leaf curvature of some mutants is complicated as global curvature and different local curvature are mixed, and the regions of alternative curvature must be separated and measured digitally. Thirdly, leaf curvature is affected by environmental conditions; the subtle difference caused by physiological elements should be distinguished from that caused by genetic elements by numerical representation. This study involved the three <italic>hyl1</italic> mutants, eight MIR165/166 mutants, and eight mutants of five HD-ZIP III genes. Most of them displayed leaf incurvature. It was realized that the CI is very useful for defining the strength of the mutant alleles and difference in gene function between the mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Elastic buckling may explain some types of curvature when the genetic coding is altered</title><p>The leaves of most higher plants are approximately flat, facilitating the efficient capture of sunlight for photosynthesis. Although such flatness is often taken for granted, the probability of this happening by chance is low because there are many ways for a structure to adopt curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In nature, many genes are involved in the initiation and maintenance of leaf flatness. When the genes responsible for leaf flatness act properly, leaves are flat. However, the genes responsible for leaf flatness are often not properly expressed, so some specific types of curvature appear. Interestingly, elastic buckling may explain some types of curvature. The adaxial identity genes <italic>REV</italic>, <italic>PHV</italic>, and <italic>PHB</italic> maintain adaxial/abaxial polarity necessary for leaf polarity. When expression is blocked or overexpression occurs, the affected leaves may exhibit a shell structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moulia, 2000</xref>). In a leaf segment showing a shell structure with double curvature, the leaf bends (curves longitudinally downward) and also rolls (curves transversely) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In <italic>rev-6</italic> mutants with a loss-of-function mutation of <italic>REV</italic>, the leaves curve downward longitudinally and transversely. In contrast, old leaves of <italic>rev-6</italic> mutants are twisted and ruffled along the edges of the blade tip; the rates of longitudinal growth at the edges of a blade exceed the rate of longitudinal growth along the midline of the blade, similar to the ruffles along the edges of the blade produced by elastic buckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Koehl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In <italic>hyl1</italic> mutants with overexpression of <italic>REV</italic>, the leaves curve downward longitudinally but upward transversely. On the other hand, mutants with wavy leaves may behave like a torn plastic sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sharon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), the edge of which forms a complex three-dimensional fractal shape. The equilibrium shape of the sheet consists of a cascade of waves along the newly formed edge. The wavy edge of <italic>jaw-1D</italic> and <italic>TCP3SRDX</italic> leaves resembles that of the torn plastic sheet, as the leaves have a wavy edge with a large wave containing many smaller waves. According to elastic theory, the sheet can easily buckle into shapes that remove in-plane compression to reduce its elastic energy. Mutants such as <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>rev</italic>, <italic>jaw-1D</italic>, and <italic>TCP3SRDX</italic> have leaves that follow some rules of elastic theory, but they do this only when the original function of the genes responsible for flatness are impaired. Elastic buckling of each mutant is different in structure and strength, and mutant alleles seem to regulate the time and places of elastic buckling. It will be important to explore the contribution of the genes responsible for leaf flatness and elasticity in formation of leaf shape.</p><p>Elasticity theory shows that the same amount of growth inhomogeneity produces greater curvature in a thinner leaf. As the sheet becomes thinner and the compression increases, the possible wavelengths of the buckles are smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sharon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, this pattern is not observed for some mutant plants. The <italic>hyl1</italic> and <italic>dcl1-9</italic> leaves appear much thicker than the wild type even though they curve transversely and longitudinally (data not shown). The relationship of leaf thickness to the extent of curvature may be conditional on the genes mutated. When several mutant alleles of the same gene are compared, the correlation between leaf thickness and the extent of curvature could be more meaningful.</p><p>Curvature is found in many flower petals, lichens, and leaves, and leaf shape is related to curvature. The CI values can be especially useful in describing the severity of mutations and in assays of the genetic contribution to various phenotypes. In some cases, leaf curvature is beneficial for crops, such as <italic>Brassica</italic> species, which are close relatives of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and include the leafy heads (the edible parts) of Chinese cabbage, cabbage (<italic>B. oleracea</italic> ssp. <italic>capitata</italic>), and Brussels sprouts (<italic>B. oleracea</italic> ssp. <italic>gemmifera</italic>). The plants of these crops produce flat leaves to capture enough light for photosynthesis at the seedling and rosette stages, and they start to develop curved leaves to store nutrients for head formation at the folding stage. <italic>BcpLH</italic>, a homologue of the <italic>HYL1</italic> gene in Chinese cabbage, is related to leaf folding (Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000). Other genes involved in leaf folding are under study. The leaves that curve at the seedling and rosette stages have abnormal leafy heads because the genes responsible for leaf flatness are impaired. Classification and quantification of leaf curvature in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other important crops will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of leaf shape formation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq111/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq111/DC1"><bold>Figure S1.</bold></ext-link> The mutated sequences complemented by miRNAs in the target genes.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq111/DC1"><bold>Figure S2.</bold></ext-link> Diagram of the mutant alleles of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> used in this study.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq111/DC1"><bold>Table S1.</bold></ext-link> Primers used in this work.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq111/DC1"><bold>Table S2.</bold></ext-link> Probe sequences for northern blot in this work.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Fedoroff (Pennsylvania State University, USA), Dr Fletcher (Plant Gene Expression Center, USA), Dr Clark (University of Michigan, USA), Dr Weigel (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Germany), Dr Bowman (University of California, USA), and Dr Chen (Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology &#x00026; Ecology, China) for providing the mutant seeds.
