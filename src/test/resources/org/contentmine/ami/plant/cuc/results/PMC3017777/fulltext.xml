Furthermore, primordia emergence from these meristems is disrupted such that several primordia arise simultaneously instead of sequentially.

The loss of spatial and temporal organization of <italic>fil-9 </italic>inflorescence and floral meristems presumably leads to disrupted cell allocation to developing floral organs and to a blurring of organ whorl boundaries. This disruption is reflected in morphological and organ identity aberrations of <italic>fil-9 </italic>floral organs and in the production of filamentous organs that are not perceived as flowers.

The SAM is organized into three zones, namely a central zone (CZ) at the SAM summit in which cells divide slowly to replenish the SAM population, a slowly-dividing organizing center (OC) which lies below the CZ, and a peripheral zone (PZ) in which cells divide more rapidly and become allocated to presumptive organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. SAM homeostasis is dependent on the appropriate balance of cell proliferation and differentiation among these three zones.</p><p>These meristematic domains are maintained in part by a negative feedback loop between <italic>WUSCHEL </italic>(<italic>WUS) </italic>and <italic>CLAVATA3 </italic>(<italic>CLV3</italic>) (for recent reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). <italic>WUS </italic>encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that is expressed in the OC and acts to promote the expression of the CLV3 ligand in the CZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. CLV3 is thought to bind to the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex, which in turn limits the domain of expression of <italic>WUS </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The indeterminate state of cells within the meristem is also dependent on members of the <italic>KNOX </italic>gene family that are expressed in the SAM but excluded from incipient organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Cells at the periphery of the CZ begin to differentiate concomitant with the downregulation of <italic>KNOX </italic>genes and the expression of <italic>AINTEGUMENTA </italic>(<italic>ANT</italic>), regulating cell proliferation in the emerging organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Organ outgrowth is accompanied by the establishment of a boundary zone separating the primordium from the adjacent meristematic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Lateral organ polarity is determined by the converse activities of abaxially-expressed <italic>KANADI </italic>and members of the <italic>YABBY </italic>(<italic>YAB</italic>) gene family and of the adaxially-expressed <italic>PHABULOSA </italic>and <italic>PHAVOLUTA </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. SAM activity is also regulated by signals emanating from the organ primordia. Several studies have demonstrated that abaxialization of organs by ectopic expression of abaxial genes or by repression of adaxial genes causes arrest or loss of the SAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Additionally, in <italic>Petunia</italic>, the <italic>HAIRY MERISTEM </italic>gene that is expressed in organ primordia is required for SAM maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Upon transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase, the SAM becomes an inflorescence meristem (IM). The IM gives rise to lateral meristems in its PZ which acquire a floral fate to become floral meristems (FMs). The FMs differentiate into flowers composed of four whorls of different types of floral organs. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, specific combinations of the four classes of organ identity genes (ABCE) specify the type of organ formed in each flower whorl. The ABCE factors are expressed specifically in the whorls of their function, with spatial specificity of their expression domains being critical for correct floral organ differentiation and for avoiding the appearance of chimeric organs with mixed identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Proper flower development demands maintenance of the borders between the whorls within the flower and between the organs in each whorl. A and C class factors negatively regulate each other, thereby creating mutually exclusive expression domains divided at the second and third whorl boundary. <italic>SUPERMAN </italic>(<italic>SUP</italic>) regulates the border between the third and forth whorls, preventing expansion of B factors into the forth whorl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. UNSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) activates the B class genes found in the second and third whorls and is thought to set up the inner and outer boundaries of the B domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON1/2 </italic>regulate the separation of organs within whorls (sepals and stamens) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and are also expressed in the borders of whorl 2, where they inhibit proliferation of cells in these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In a mutant screen for plants affected in floral organ development, we have isolated a new allele of <italic>filamentous flower </italic>(<italic>fil</italic>), a member of the <italic>YAB </italic>(<italic>YAB</italic>) gene family. The <italic>YAB </italic>genes, <italic>FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), YAB2 </italic>and <italic>YAB3</italic>, are all expressed on the abaxial side of developing vegetative lateral organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>FIL </italic>is expressed in a dynamic fashion during floral development, with expression initially seen throughout the abaxial side of floral meristems, and later on the abaxial sides of floral organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. <italic>fil yab3 </italic>double mutants exhibit a loss of adaxial-abaxial polarity in the vegetative organs and occasional formation of ectopic SAM structures on leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Yet, <italic>fil </italic>single mutants do not show a vegetative phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] but rather are strongly affected in flower structure and floral organ number, morphology and to some extent, identity.</p><p><italic>fil </italic>mutant plants also show abnormalities in inflorescence development. As <italic>fil </italic>floral phenotypes can not be explained in terms of loss of abaxial identity, a different role for <italic>FIL </italic>in inflorescence and flower development is likely. Earlier studies, in addressing the range of <italic>fil </italic>phenotypes, had indicated that <italic>FIL </italic>plays multiple roles in inflorescence and flower formation and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, it was suggested that <italic>FIL</italic>, together with <italic>YAB3 </italic>and other genes, regulates the organized growth of the SAM via a non-cell-autonomous mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. By driving expression of <italic>YAB </italic>family members in the PZ of the SAM, alterations in the expression of CZ markers could be detected, implying that <italic>YAB </italic>genes function in signaling across the meristem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>FIL </italic>itself is redundantly regulated by the myb domain gene, <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES (AS1)</italic>, and the trans-acting siRNA gene, <italic>TAS3</italic>, both of which are expressed in organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In turn, genes expressed in the meristem also control <italic>FIL </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have isolated a new <italic>fil </italic>allele, <italic>fil</italic>-9, and dissected the process of reproductive organ development in the mutant. By following flower development from the inflorescence and floral mersitems, we have discovered new features of <italic>fil </italic>phenotypes. We observe a correlation between the meristem phenotypes to different aspects of <italic>fil </italic>floral mutants. As such, we suggest a causal link between the role of <italic>fil </italic>in meristem organization and the multifaceted floral and inflorescence abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of a novel <italic>fil </italic>allele</title><p>To identify new mutations affecting floral organ morphology and development, we screened a population of activation tagged T-DNA lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This screen yielded a mutant whose phenotype resembled that of <italic>fil </italic>loss-of-function plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. When crossed with <italic>fil-8 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] homozygous plants, all F1 progeny showed the <italic>fil </italic>mutant phenotype, indicating that the newly isolated mutant was allelic to <italic>fil</italic>. Therefore the novel mutant was named <italic>fil-9</italic>. <italic>fil-9 </italic>backcrosses yielded a 3:1 ratio of wild type versus <italic>fil </italic>mutant phenotypes in the F2 generation (92 wild type:29 mutant), indicating that the <italic>fil-9 </italic>mutation segregated as a single locus recessive mutation. In addition, the <italic>fil-9 </italic>line was outcrossed for three generations to eliminate any possible additional mutations.</p><p>The T-DNA insert was mapped to the third intron of the <italic>FIL </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), using T-DNA- and gene-specific primers (see Methods). RT-PCR analyses using gene-specific primers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) spanning the region upstream to the T-DNA insert or the region downstream to the insertion were performed to verify that the T-DNA insertion indeed disrupts <italic>FIL </italic>gene expression. As demonstrated by RT-PCR, a partial transcript was produced, albeit at a somewhat lower level than in wild type. The full length transcript was not, however, detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The <italic>FIL </italic>region upstream to the T-DNA insertion contains the coding sequence of the zinc finger domain of the protein (amino acid residues 22-60; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] as well as the putative self-interaction domain (amino acid residues 22-60; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] but lacks the HMG-box DNA binding domain (amino acid residues 146-179; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Although a partial <italic>FIL </italic>transcript is produced by the <italic>fil-9 </italic>allele, the mutant phenotypes indicate that the T-DNA insertion most likely results in <italic>FIL </italic>loss-of-function and does not cause a dominant negative effect. Finally, it should be noted that <italic>fil-9 </italic>is in the Columbia-7 (Col-7) background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while all other characterized <italic>fil </italic>alleles are in the Landsberg <italic>erecta </italic>(L<italic>er</italic>) background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The T-DNA insertion in the <italic>fil-9 </italic>allele</bold>.

The first few flowers usually developed one or two petals (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), while most late-arising flowers lacked petals (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Many of the petals were shorter or narrower than were wild type petals, and some had a filamentous base or were completely filamentous (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). In contrast to the general reduction in petal size, petals wider than those seen in the wild type also developed, albeit rarely (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>).</p><p>Functional stamens (i.e. pollen-producing) developed almost only in early-arising flowers (i.e. within the first five flowers), with the number of stamens being highly variable in <italic>fil-9 </italic>flowers. Determining the number of stamens was, however, difficult. Many filamentous structures that developed were most likely stamens in origin. However, it was often unclear from which whorl the filaments originated (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). Some of the stamens developed an anther presenting normal morphology yet that did not mature to shed pollen. Many of the stamens bore a distorted anther which could range from containing enlarged and swollen locules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>, arrow) to assuming a flattened, elongated and curled structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>, arrowhead). Often, only a filament developed, with its edge being sometimes swollen and bent. Occasionally, stamens developed at the base of, or attached to, a petal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>) or a sepal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>).</p><p>Most <italic>fil-9 </italic>flowers developed normal carpels, yet only the first few flowers were fertile and produced seeds. Manual pollination with wild type pollen was successful, indicating that the semi-sterility of the plants resulted from the presence of mostly dysfunctional stamens. Nonetheless, in later-arising flowers, some carpels were not fully fused and the septum was not fully united (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>), some contained bent carpels, and in some, the style was elongated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>). In a few cases, the gyneocium comprised three carpels. Very late flowers (i.e. starting approximately from the 35<sup>th </sup>flower) were composed only of a gyneocium, which was highly twisted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>). This appearance corresponds to a characteristic termination form of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>plants that fail to develop seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p><italic>fil-9 </italic>flowers thus showed a general reduction in organ number and size.

However, homeotic transformations occurred in less than a quarter of all flowers. Notably, these transformations were never complete, instead resulting in chimeric organs with mixed identity, with our definition of a chimeric organ not being based on the organ shape (e.g. a filamentous base). Instead, we considered an organ to have a chimeric identity only if it displayed tissue-characteristics of different organ types, i.e. sepals with characteristics of petal epidermis, etc. The most common transformed organs were petaloid sepals (usually sepals with white petaloid margins; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>, arrowhead). Very rarely, sepals with stigmatic tissue at the edge (i.e. carpeloid sepals) were observed (data not shown). Petals or petaloid organs developing locules (stamenoid petals) were also relatively frequent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>). Much rarer were sepaloid petals (petaloid organs in the second whorl with a green-sepaloid tip; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>, arrow) or sepaloid organs containing locules in the second whorl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>, arrow).

The partial transformation of sepals to petals suggested an expansion of B class function, while the formation of stigmatic papillae on stamen-like organs was indicative of a loss of B class activity. Transformation of petals into a more stamenoid structure and the development of locules on petals implied the expansion of C class function. On the other hand, some of the mosaic organs appeared to be stamens transformed into petals indicative of a loss of C class function. Thus, it appears that these partial homeotic transformations are the result of variable shifts in the domains of organ identity gene activity.</p><p>In addition to the marked floral defects, <italic>fil-9 </italic>plants showed other abnormalities reflecting defects in inflorescence development. These include elongated pedicels, the occasional development of a filamentous bract subtending the flower (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q</xref>), and the clustering of flowers in relatively short segments along the inflorescence, separated by segments harboring short green filaments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref>).</p><p>The variable phenotype of <italic>fil-9 </italic>flowers suggested that the severity of the effect of the mutation was somewhat stochastic.

To facilitate the measurements, the outline of the cells in the meristem was marked by staining the plasma membranes with the lipophilic dye, FM-64, (red) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and by L1 layer expression of GFP fused to the plasma-membrane-localized PIN1 protein (green) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

This is reflected in the irregular temporal order of emergence of floral primordia on the flanks of the IM, with several floral primordia arising simultaneously, instead of sequentially (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref> (<italic>fil-9</italic>) and 3F (wild type), respectively). In addition, many floral organs emerge concurrently, both within the same and in different whorls within the flower (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>An additional feature of floral emergence from <italic>fil-9 </italic>IM was the distorted orientation of the flowers towards the axis of the IM, as deduced by the position of the sepals (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> (<italic>fil-9</italic>) compared to 3A and 3D (wild type)). This was accompanied by changes in the order of sepal development. In wild type flowers, the abaxial sepal developed first, followed by the adaxial sepal and finally, the two lateral sepals (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). However, in <italic>fil-9 </italic>flowers, two sepals, or other organs occupying that position, developed in abaxial lateral positions, with the two other sepals developing later, in the adaxial position (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The filamentous structures produced by <italic>fil-9 </italic>inflorescence meristem do not replace true flowers</title><p>As previously noted, <italic>fil-9 </italic>defective inflorescence meristems produce several organs simultaneously, with many of these being filamentous organs with no clear identity. Earlier studies on other <italic>fil </italic>alleles reported that the development of such filaments is confined to a defined region along the inflorescence stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Under our growth conditions, we could not find filaments concentrated and/or limited to a specific zone, neither in <italic>fil-9 </italic>nor in two additional alleles (i.e. <italic>fil-5 </italic>and <italic>fil-8</italic>). To assess whether the filaments produced by the <italic>fil-9 </italic>IM have a floral identity, the number of flowers produced by the primary IMs during the course of reproductive development was compared between <italic>fil-9 </italic>and wild type plants. In these measurements, only organs with floral structures but not filaments were counted as flowers. During the first three weeks of flower production, <italic>fil-9 </italic>and wild type IMs produced the same number of flowers, at the same rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, in the fourth week, where as the wild type production rate did not change, <italic>fil-9 </italic>floral production accelerated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). During the fifth week, wild type floral production sharply declined, while the rate of <italic>fil-9 </italic>floral production was only slightly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Wild type flower production ceased after the fifth week, producing a total of 35 flowers on average, while <italic>fil-9 </italic>IMs proliferated for an additional week, producing a total of 60 flowers on average (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

In the inflorescence, unlike the vegetative parts of the plant, <italic>FIL </italic>functions, at least partially, in non-redundant manner, such that mutations in the gene lead to visually perceptible phenotypes.

In our study, we have characterized a new <italic>fil </italic>allele in the Col background.

We further propose an explanation as to how these are causally related, thus highlighting the potential of using <italic>fil </italic>mutants to study mersitem organization and its effect on flower morphogenesis</p><p>We have shown that the shape and size of both the IM and FM is altered in <italic>fil-9 </italic>mutant plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and that this results from an increase in cell number rather than in cell size. These alterations are associated with defects in primordia initiation, such that several floral bud primordia and multiple floral organs can emerge simultaneously. The changes in the FM presumably prevent the establishment of defined whorls and lead to disruption of the orderly allocation of cells to the emerging organs. We propose that as a result of the blurring of the boundaries between different whorls, the <italic>fil-9 </italic>flowers developed the observed defects in organ identity. The hypothesis that <italic>FIL </italic>does not function as a regulator of the expression of organ identity genes per se is supported by the fact that we never observed full organ conversion, while alterations in organ identity occurred only occasionally.</p><p>The organ growth defects observed in <italic>fil </italic>mutants are unlikely to be the result of a simple change in meristem size. In mutants affecting meristem size, such as <italic>clavata </italic>or <italic>wuschel</italic>, changes in meristem size indeed lead to an alteration in organ number. The shape and identity of the organs remain, however, unaltered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Moreover, although <italic>fil </italic>meristems are larger than are those in wild type plants, the floral defects are mostly displayed in reduced number and size of the floral organs. The variable defects in floral organ formation and organization in <italic>fil-9 </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) resemble those produced by mutations in <italic>tousled</italic>, a gene that encodes a protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. <italic>tousled </italic><italic>clavata </italic>double mutants do not show a restoration of organ patterning, indicating that simply increasing meristem size can not compensate for loss of <italic>tousled </italic>function. This raised the possibility that <italic>TOUSLED </italic>may promote specific cell divisions within the meristem, rather than having a general proliferative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Likewise, the high variability in the number and morphology of <italic>fil </italic>floral organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) suggests that disruption of the cell proliferation process occurs within localized areas of activity in the meristem.</p><p>The defects we observed are consistent with the suggestion that <italic>FIL </italic>plays a role in regulating the partitioning of the IM and FM into distinct domains. A number of genes have been implicated in establishing meristematic domains by regulating the specification of the CZ, the boundary between proliferating and differentiating cells, or the development of organ primordia at the periphery of the meristem (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). In addition, auxin flux across the meristem is critical for normal patterning, with feedback between genes regulating auxin distribution and those regulating meristematic domains taking place. This suggests an intimate connection between these pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. For instance, mutations in boundary genes, such as <italic>BOP1 </italic>and <italic>BOP2</italic>, as well as mutations in auxin influx carriers produce inflorescence and floral defects similar to those we observe in <italic>fil-9 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Based on these similarities in phenotype, in conjunction with the defects observed in IM and FM organization, we suggest that <italic>FIL </italic>is required for the appropriate delineation of CZ and PZ boundaries within these meristems. The disorderly emergence of organ primordia in <italic>fil-9 </italic>plants can be explained by disruption of these boundary domains. Many of these organs are, however, filamentous. Note that when these organs were not included when counting the number of flowers produced by <italic>fil-9 </italic>inflorescences, the number of flowers in the mutant was the same as in wild type plants, throughout most of the reproductive phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Sawa et al. have previously shown that similar filamentous structures in the <italic>fil</italic>-1 mutant express the floral meristem identity gene, <italic>AP1</italic>, but gradually lose the expression of the floral meristem identity gene, <italic>LEAFY </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that the filamentous organs produced by <italic>fil </italic>IM have a floral meristem identity, although this is insufficient to maintain floral identity. The disruption of meristem organization can also explain the occasional development of a cryptic bract - a normally arrested organ - in <italic>fil </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]).</p><p>Verifying the involvement of <italic>FIL </italic>in the establishment and maintenance of IM boundaries awaits analysis of expression patterns of meristem, primordia and boundary markers, such as <italic>STM, ANT, CUC2 </italic>and <italic>UFO</italic>, in <italic>fil </italic>inflorescences. For example, it was shown by Goldschmidt and colleagues (2008) that altering <italic>FIL </italic>and <italic>YAB3 </italic>expression leads to changes in the expression of <italic>LATERAL SUPPRESSOR</italic>, a gene which is normally expressed at the boundary of organ primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this regard, it could be informative to compare the expression patterns of meristem boundary markers in <italic>fil-9 </italic>which is in the Col background versus other reported <italic>fil </italic>alleles that are in the L<italic>er </italic>background. Differences have been noted in the shape of wild type inflorescence meristems in different <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ecotypes in terms of height and width though not in the internal organization of layers and zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It therefore, would be of interest to test whether these different genetic backgrounds differentially sensitize meristem-primordia signaling pathways.</p><p>The variable homeotic transformations of floral organs suggest that, similar to IM, <italic>fil </italic>floral whorls boundaries are also likely to be disrupted. It was previously suggested that <italic>fil </italic>might be a direct regulator of floral organ identity genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, the range of mosaic organs that develop within each flower point towards shifts in the expression domains of the identity genes as a result of misallocation of cells to the different whorls. This could be tested by examining the expression patterns of the floral organ identity genes and whorl boundary genes, such as <italic>SUP</italic>, in <italic>fil </italic>flowers. Previous studies on <italic>fil </italic>alleles have presented analyses of expression of the floral organ identity genes, <italic>AP1</italic>, <italic>APETALA3</italic>, <italic>PISTILLATA </italic>and <italic>AGAMOUS </italic>in <italic>fil </italic>flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, such analyses were limited to specific types of <italic>fil </italic>abnormal flowers and did not address the wide range of floral organ phenotypes that exist in <italic>fil </italic>mutants. Thus, the complex alteration in expression patterns of the organ identity genes that occurs could not be fully revealed.</p><p>In an attempt to explain the formation of mosaic organs in flowers of several <italic>ap2 </italic>and <italic>ag </italic>alleles, Bowman et al. suggest that the primordia of these organs encompass more than a single geographic whorl, resulting in organs composed of cell arising from different whorls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. We suggest that in <italic>fil</italic>, whorl boundaries are erratic, resulting in organs with abnormal shapes and mixed identities.</p><p>An additional support for the causal relationship between the disrupted meristem organization and the various phenotypes of <italic>fil </italic>floral organs is that these phenotypes are more severe in later-arising inflorescences and flowers (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Such acropetal changes in <italic>fil-9 </italic>mutant phenotypes are correlated with changes in meristem size and shape. We have documented that meristems at a late developmental stage are smaller than those at an earlier stage, both in wild type and in <italic>fil </italic>inflorescences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). It is hence possible that the age-dependent depletion of the meristematic pool intensifies the distortion of the inflorescence and floral mersitems in <italic>fil-9 </italic>plants and thus, their floral phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through the characterization of a new <italic>fil </italic>allele, <italic>fil-9</italic>, we have re-evaluated the role of <italic>FIL </italic>in the organization of IMs and FMs and in the emergence of reproductive organ primordia. <italic>fil-9 </italic>floral organs are highly variable in terms of organ number, size and morphology. In addition, <italic>fil-9 </italic>plants show disruption of floral whorl boundaries, with floral organs occasionally displaying mixed identities. The high variability of the floral aberrations indicated that they are the result of underlying defects in the meristem. Indeed, both the inflorescence and floral meristems of <italic>fil-9 </italic>plants are larger (i.e. containing more cells) and are distorted, as compared to these meristems in wild type plants, and produce several primordia in a simultaneous rather than a sequential manner. Moreover, the age-dependent decrease in meristem size was correlated with enhanced severity of floral phenotypes. Overall, our results support the role of <italic>FIL </italic>in the organization of the meristem and provide new insight into the relationship between meristem organization and floral form.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>fil-9 </italic>line was isolated from activation-tagged lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] in a Col-7 background.
