General protective responses, namely the induction of pathways regulating synthesis of UV-B absorbing compounds such as the Phenylpropanoid pathway, the induction of different antioxidant defense systems and the activation of pathways commonly associated with pathogen defense and abiotic stress responses seem to play critical roles in grapevine responses against UV-B radiation. Furthermore, high fluence rate UV-B seemed to specifically modulate additional pathways and processes in order to protect grapevine plantlets against UV-B-induced oxidative stress, stop the cell cycle progression, and control protein degradation.

Most of the UV-B solar radiation is absorbed by the stratospheric ozone layer and other atmospheric gases and therefore only a minor proportion reaches the Earth's surface. The level of UV-B is dependent on several factors such as latitude, season, time of day, cloud cover, and altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The effects of UV-B have been analyzed on diverse plants species and vary depending on UV-B fluence rates, duration and wavelength of the UV-B treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Exposure to UV-B amounts much higher than those found in nature causes tissue necrosis and induces the expression of many genes normally involved in defense, wounding, or general stress responses. That is, several studies have reported damage to DNA, proteins and membranes and the inhibition of protein synthesis and photosynthetic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Ultraviolet-B radiation is not necessarily a damage-inducing source of stress but instead can act as an important environmental cue in higher plants, regulating several key developmental plant responses. At ambient UV-B levels, crosstalk between wounding and UV-B signaling pathways seem to modify plant-insect interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, exposure to such low non-damaging levels of UV-B has numerous regulatory effects on plant morphology, physiology, and biochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These low fluence rates of UV-B promote the expression in a range of genes that are known to be involved in UV-B protection or amelioration of UV-B damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Among the most important protective mechanisms in higher plants are the accumulation of UV-absorbing phenolic compounds in epidermal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the enhancement of cellular antioxidant systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similar responses have also been shown in grapevine plants (<italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>L. cv. Malbec) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Over the last years efforts have been focused on the study of the molecular responses of plants to UV-B radiation. Several reports have analyzed the changes in gene expression caused by UV-B in many plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] using microarray analysis. Interestingly, these studies have shown that some UV-B response pathways are shared with other environmental cues, while additional pathways may account for UV-B-specific responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], pointing out the existence of common as well as stress-specific gene expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>L.) plants there is no available information on the changes in gene expression triggered by UV-B radiation. However, different microarray platforms have been used in this species to analyze transcriptomic variation during berry development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], water and salinity stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and fungal pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Malbec is a grapevine cultivar well adapted to the growing conditions of Argentine, were it became the emblematic icon of the country's wine industry. In the province of Mendoza, the major wine-producing region in the country, vineyards are located at heights ranging from 500 to 1500 m a.s.l. Such variations in altitude account for different fluence rates and dosages of UV-B reaching the vineyards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, Malbec plants growing at different altitude develop different UV-B responsive mechanisms that are relevant for the final composition of grape berries and affect the quality of wine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we used a new custom made Affymetrix GrapeGen GeneChip&#x02122; (Lijavetzky et <italic>al., In preparation</italic>) to investigate gene expression responses of leaf tissues from <italic>in vitro </italic>cultured grapevine cv.

The minimum and maximum UV-B fluence rate of solar radiation perceived by vineyards at 1,450 m a.s.l. at early morning and noon for the Mendoza's region is of <italic>c.a </italic>9 and 35 &#x003bc;W cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The functional classification of the differentially expressed genes and the pictorial representation of the significantly modulated classes were accomplished by means of the MapMan software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] using adapted files specifically designed for the custom made Grapegen GeneChip&#x02122;. Our results showed that transcription in grapevine leaves is differentially affected by UV-B fluence rate. We found that the number of modulated probe sets (up- and down-regulated) under high fluence rate UV-B was two-fold higher than the number of probe sets modulated under low intensity UV-B. Transcripts commonly modulated under both UV-B treatments as well as transcripts specifically regulated in an UV-B-fluence rate dependent way were identified. The functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that while high fluence rate UV-B had regulatory effects on defense or general stress response pathways, low fluence rate UV-B promoted the expression of genes involved in UV-B protection or the alleviation of the UV-B damage, likely contributing to the acclimation of plants to UV-B exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>High UV-B has a stronger effect on gene expression than low UV-B</title><p>Genome wide analysis of gene expression variation in <italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>cv.

This analysis revealed that high fluence rate UV-B up-regulated the expression of 1532 probe sets and down-regulated 1243, while low UV-B induced 745 and repressed 572 probe sets, both compared to control leaf tissues from plantlets grown under UV-B filtered light (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).

Interestingly, different functional categories were specifically modulated (either induced or repressed) depending on UV-B fluence rate (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous reports indicating that different UV-B fluence rates can elicit different responses on diverse plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, in maize certain genes are only induced above certain thresholds of UV-B irradiance intensity, suggesting the operation of diverse signaling pathways at different fluence rates within the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Over-expression of the functional category "Biotic stress" (BIN 4.2) was a common feature of both UV-B treatments (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, high fluence rate UV-B had the strongest inductive effect on this category (i.e. the number of high UV-B-induced genes included in the "Biotic stress" category was higher compared with those induced by low UV-B; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>).

These overlapping responses among UV-B, wounding, and pathogenesis could result from the accumulation of common signaling molecules mediating wound/defense responses such as calcium, reactive oxygen species (ROS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]), or hormones such as ethylene. Thus, the effects of UV-B light on the induction of biotic stress associated-genes, could improve plant resistance to pathogens and pests.

It has been established that ethylene as well as ethylene response factor (ERF) proteins play important regulatory roles in plant pathogen resistance and abiotic stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. ERFs belong to a large family of APETALA2-domain-containing TFs that bind to a GCC-box present in the promoters of many ethylene inducible defense-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We found that several genes, putatively annotated as ERFs and ethylene responsive proteins, were commonly over expressed under both UV-B treatments (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). These results are in agreement with a previous study carried out by Ulm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in Arabidopsis, showing that activation of the ethylene pathway is a general response to UV-B exposition. In grapevine, ethylene plays an important role in berry development and ripening processes including the regulation of gene expression for anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As shown here, ethylene also seems to participate in the modulation of leaf responses to UV-B radiation (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8a</xref>).</p><p>Many transcription factors are known to be rapidly induced by UV-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and these proteins likely play key roles in UV-B-induced responses. Apart from ERFs, two additional categories of TF families were significantly over represented after exposition of grapevine plantlets to both UV-B light: "WRKY TFs" (BIN 16.2.5.20), and "NAC TFs" (BIN 16.2.5.14, Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The NAC domain (Petunia NAM and Arabidopsis ATAF1/2 and CUC2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]) proteins are plant specific TFs and are expressed in various developmental stages and tissues, although details of their interactions with DNA and with other proteins are still limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

Among the up-regulated processes three functional categories were significantly overrepresented: BIN 5.1 corresponding to "Sugar binding proteins", BIN 11.4.1 "Heat shock proteins" (Hsps) and BIN 16.2.5.15 "Pathogenesis related TFs" (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The functional category of "Sugar binding proteins" (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8c</xref>) includes genes mainly encoding different kind of lectins (curculin-like, -Mannose-binding- lectin, D-galactoside L-rhamnose binding lectin, and lectin 2) and glycoproteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Lectins comprise a miscellaneous group of proteins able to bind carbohydrate residues of different chemical nature in a specific and reversible way. Although protection against pathogens is the major function attributed to lectins, their accumulation in plant tissues have also been described under different abiotic stresses or as a result of growth and developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These proteins could play a role in the protection of plant cell against damaging effects of free radicals as hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Thus, in the high fluence UV-B response, the induction of lectins could be interpreted as a mechanism to shorten the duration of the "oxidative burst" and to protect grapevine leaves against high UV-B induced-ROS.</p><p>Hsps and their regulatory transcription factors (Hsfs) play a broad role as molecular chaperones in the tolerance to multiple environmental stresses apart from heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Some Hsps act as molecular chaperones counteracting protein denaturation and aggregation while other Hsps including ubiquitin and certain proteases, target nonnative proteins for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Hsps function may extend beyond their chaperone activity, limiting the damage that results from ROS accumulation. In fact, exposure to UV-B radiation, which increases cellular concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, activates Hsfs expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In agreement with those reports our results show that genes encoding several Hsps (with mitochondrial, chloroplastic, and cytoplasmic localization) as well as Hsfs are differentially up-regulated under high fluence rate UV-B (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>The induction of the expression of genes in the functional category of "Pathogenesis related TFs" detected under high UV-B but not under low UV-B (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) could be part of the same general response to biotic stress (BIN 4.2) observed at both UV-B fluence rates mentioned above. Given the existence of a slight difference in the number of genes induced under each UV-B treatment this category is significantly represented only under high UV-B. However, this category must be relevant under both conditions.</p><p>Down regulation of gene expression is also an important effect of UV-B light exposure although as mentioned above fluence rates have specific effects on the functional categories that are down regulated. The strong down-regulation of the category "Cell cycle" (BIN 4.13) is a specific feature of high UV-B (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Indeed, our results revealed that the activities of several cell cycle-related genes are temporally paused in the leaves of grapevine plantlets exposed to high UV-B (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). High UV-B specifically down-regulates the expression of genes encoding cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, kinesins and cell division control proteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). It is likely advantageous for grapevine cells to temporally halt cell cycle, to allow for repairing DNA damage and to prevent the introduction of mutations into the DNA of daughter cells. It is well documented that UV-B photons may cause cellular damage by generating photoproducts of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. DNA damage is also known to induce cell cycle arrest and rapid protein turnover via the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In fact, it has been proposed that UV-B could delay cell division by arresting cell cycle in the G1/S transition phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Finally, among the functional categories specifically regulated by high UV-B, "Blue light signaling" (BIN 8.2.1) is also found down-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8e</xref>). Genes encoding TFs acting downstream of phototropin photoreceptors are differentially repressed under high UV-B (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are blue-light (BL)-sensitive receptor kinases, involved in the control of BL-activated stomatal opening and chloroplast relocation in addition to the phototropism response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. It is known that these phototropins use signal transducers for different photoinduced movement responses in different tissue. Thus, in the phototropic response of hypocotyls, nonphototropic hypocotyl 3 (NPH3) is a common regulator in the phot1-and phot2-signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Also, it was shown that NPH3-mediated phototropin signaling optimizes the efficiency of BL-perception by inducing both optimal leaf positioning and leaf flattening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Our results show a significant down-regulation of the NHP3 transcription factor (Additional file 9) suggesting that high UV-B might trigger a negative phototropic response of grapevine leaves as an escape response to protect leaf tissues against potentially damaging UV-B radiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential responses regulated by low UV-B radiation</title><p>Similar to the functional categories specifically regulated by high fluence rate UV-B, different processes represented in additional categories are regulated by low UV-B (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Among them, the functional category "Abscisic acid metabolism" (BIN 16.1.4.1, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8a</xref>) is specifically up-regulated by low UV-B light. It is known that ABA mediates adaptive responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in vegetative tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], although the role of ABA in UV-B-induced responses has just begun to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].

An overview of the genes which gave significance to this category shows that low UV-B affected components commonly involved in stress responses such as putative Thaumatin-like proteins, Pathogenesis-related protein PR-1 precursor, putative senescence-associated proteins, Allergen V5 Tpx-1 and chitinase-like proteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].

Genes encoding a particular class of ATPases, named AAA ATPase is specifically up-regulated under this UV-B treatment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). <underline>A</underline>TPase <underline>A</underline>ssociated with various cellular <underline>A</underline>ctivities (AAA) proteins are characterized by the presence of one or several conserved motives including the Walker A and Walker B required for ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively, and a highly conserved amino acid sequence termed the second region of homology (SRH, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]). This protein family is commonly distributed among eukaryotes and is involved in several cellular functions. Information on the role of AAA ATPases is very limited in plants.

The number of genes modulated (up- and down-regulated) by UV-B light exposure was two-fold higher under high fluence rate UV-B than under low fluence rate UV-B. Analysis of the functional categories differentially represented under high and low UV-B revealed that the existence of common and specific responses regulated at different UV-B intensity. General protective responses such as the induction of pathways regulating the synthesis of UV-B absorbing phenolic compounds, the induction of antioxidant defense systems, and the activation of signal transduction pathways associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses played critical roles independently of fluence rate. Furthermore, increased fluence rates triggered additional stress responses involving the induction of heat shock and sugar binding proteins and causing a rapid decline in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle. Then again, low fluence rate UV-B promoted additional transcriptional responses that could be interpreted as acclimation processes such as the induction of ABA catabolism and chloroplast protein turnover associated ATPases or the repression of genes involved in cell wall modification and auxin metabolism and responses. These findings provide a preliminary functional genomics framework to understand the complexity of grapevine UV-B radiation responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and in vitro culture</title><p>Wood cuttings corresponding to three-nodal lignified segments derived from virus-free plants of <italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>L. cv.

Three independently grown, harvested, and extracted sets of samples corresponding to each experimental treatment were prepared as biological replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>hybridization</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from leaf tissues using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to standard procedures. DNase digestion of contaminating DNA in the RNA samples was carried out with the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN). Final RNA purification was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to standard protocols. Samples were analyzed at the Genomics Unit of the Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC, Madrid). RNA integrity analyses were done with an Agilent's Bioanalyzer 2100. Probe synthesis, microarrays hybridization, washing, staining and scanning with the GeneChip&#x02122; Scanner 3000 were performed according to the Affymetrix GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Expression Analysis Technical Manual.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression and functional analyses</title><p>The mRNA expression profiles of the different treatments described above were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen custom GeneChip&#x02122; (Lijavetzky et <italic>al., In preparation</italic>). This new GeneChip generated for grapevine (genome size about 475 Mb) contains 23096 probe sets. Probe sets design was based on the publicly available Unigen information at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] by July 2006 (342576 grapevine ESTs). The probe sets represent <italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>consensus sequences (when overlapped) from Cabernet Sauvignon, Muscat Hamburg, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Shiraz cultivars. In order to determine the number of non-redundant genes represented in the GeneChip we mapped the original 23096 probe sets to the recently released 12X grapevine genomic sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] and we determined that the GeneChip contains probes sets for ca. 15800 different annotated genes. Differential expression analyses were performed using the entire probe set information. In order to carry out the functional analyses with unique probe sets we processed the corresponding produced gene list using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing both the original and "12X" probe set information. Non-redundant probe sets codes were replaced with their unique gene identifier at the "12X" while redundant probe sets were merged and we assigned their median value to the corresponding unique identifier at the 12X.</p><p>Data analysis for each treatment was performed using biological triplicates. Normalization was performed with the help of the normalization tool within the GEPAS 4.0 suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. For this procedure we used all the default Affymetrix methods defined by the GEPAS 4.0 system which were implemented in the "affy" package from Bioconductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]: a) background correction by Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) expression measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], b) between array standardization based upon quantiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>], and c) PM-MM adjustment using "pmonly" (just PM values are used). Differential expression analysis (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) was carried out using the Clear Test method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] implemented at the GEPAS 4.0 suite. This method tries to avoid the problem caused by <italic>t</italic>-tests when declaring genes with relatively small expression changes as differentially expressed if they show low observed variances. The Clear Test proposes to use the <italic>z</italic>-test as an alternative and combines that test with a &#x003c7;2 test to evaluate variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] what helps to prevent the identification of genes with high observed variances as differentially expressed. Functional analyses of the differentially expressed genes were done with the MapMan software based on the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Classification of the GrapeGen GeneChip&#x02122; probesets and MapMan files preparation</title><p>Original <italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>sequences used for the GrapeGen GeneChip&#x02122; probe design and annotation were classified into a MapMan "mapping file" after performing automated and manual database searches. Sequence were blasted against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot plant proteins sequence database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] and classified into a modified and adapted "mapping file" using as a reference model the original <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>file [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] as well as the related information present in other databases such as GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], Swiss-Prot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] and TAIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Out of the 23046 grapevine sequences, 15783 were actually sorted in 36 BINs and several subBINs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Transcript levels were determined using a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green dye (Applied Biosystems). Gene specific primers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) were designed using the Oligo Explorer 1.2 software (Gene Link) based on the corresponding probe set sequence from the custom GrapeGen GeneChip&#x02122;. No-template controls were included for each primer pair, and each PCR reaction was completed in triplicate. Data were analyzed using the 7300 SDS software 1.3 (Applied Biosystems). Dissociation curves for each amplicon were then analyzed to verify the specificity of each amplification reaction. Transcript level was calculated using the standard curve method and normalized against grapevine EF&#x003b1;1 gene (UniGene Vvi.1750) used as reference control.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Availability</title><p>All microarray expression data produced in our study are publically available at the ArrayExpress database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] under the accession number E-MEXP-2541.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MP designed and coordinated the study, carried out <italic>in vitro Vitis vinifera </italic>cv.
