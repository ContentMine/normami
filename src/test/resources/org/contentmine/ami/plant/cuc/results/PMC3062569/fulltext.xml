<italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV) is the causal agent of rice dwarf disease, which often results in severe yield losses of rice in East Asian countries. The disease symptoms are stunted growth, chlorotic specks on leaves, and delayed and incomplete panicle exsertion. Three RDV strains, O, D84, and S, were reported. RDV-S causes the most severe symptoms, whereas RDV-O causes the mildest. Twenty amino acid substitutions were found in 10 of 12 virus proteins among three RDV strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We analyzed the gene expression of rice in response to infection with the three RDV strains using a 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray to examine the relationship between symptom severity and gene responses. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon the infection of RDV-O, -D84, and -S was 1985, 3782, and 6726, respectively, showing a correlation between the number of DEGs and symptom severity. Many DEGs were related to defense, stress response, and development and morphogenesis processes. For defense and stress response processes, gene silencing-related genes were activated by RDV infection and the degree of activation was similar among plants infected with the three RDV strains. Genes for hormone-regulated defense systems were also activated by RDV infection, and the degree of activation seemed to be correlated with the concentration of RDV in plants. Some development and morphogenesis processes were suppressed by RDV infection, but the degree of suppression was not correlated well with the RDV concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Gene responses to RDV infection were regulated differently depending on the gene groups regulated and the strains infecting. It seems that symptom severity is associated with the degree of gene response in defense-related and development- and morphogenesis-related processes. The titer levels of RDV in plants and the amino acid substitutions in RDV proteins could be involved in regulating such gene responses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Virus interacts with host proteins, and disturbs the gene expression of host cell.

Rice dwarf disease is caused by <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV). RDV is transmitted to rice plants by insects, in particular leafhoppers (<italic>Nephotettix</italic> spp.), after multiplication of the virus in the insect. Many cell wall- and chloroplast- related genes were suppressed, whereas various defense-related genes were activated in rice plants infected with RDV <xref rid="pone.0018094-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Three strains of RDV differentiated by the severity of symptoms they cause were reported <xref rid="pone.0018094-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Rice plants infected with the severe strain of RDV (RDV-S) were significantly more stunted than those with the ordinary strain of RDV (RDV-D84). Another strain, RDV-O, originating from RDV-D84, causes weaker symptoms than those caused by RDV-D84. To reveal specific gene responses associated with the difference in symptom severity caused by different RDV strains, we compared the gene responses in rice individually infected with RDV-S, -D84, and -O using a 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray. The result indicated that the gene responses to RDV infection were regulated differently depending on the gene group and RDV strains, and that symptom severity is associated with the degree of gene response in defense-related and development- and morphogenesis-related processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.

Virus genomes often encode a protein to inhibit the gene-silencing process in host cells (silencing suppressor) in order for viruses to propagate in host cells <xref rid="pone.0018094-DazPendn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

These observations suggest that RDV titer levels may be related to the possible difference in protein structure of Pns10 among different RDV strains.</p><p>A Type 2 response is mainly found in genes activated by RDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018094-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), such as genes involved in stress response and defense processes. It seems that the degree of response of genes in this category is correlated with RDV titer levels.</p><p>A Type 3 response is found in the expression patterns of development- and morphogenesis-related genes. It seems that a Type3 response may not be associated with RDV titer levels, since the degree of suppression in plants infected with RDV-D84 is lower than that with RDV-S, although the titer level in RDV-D84-infected plants was similar to that in RDV-S-infected plants. The suppression of host gene expression compared among <italic>Nicotiana</italic> plants infected with some RNA viruses such as <italic>Cymbidium ringspot virus, Turnip crinkle virus, Ribgrass mosaic virus, and Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV) showed that the severe suppression of host genes was associated with the development of severe symptoms <xref rid="pone.0018094-Havelda1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The amino acid changes in virus proteins are also associated with the disease symptoms. Some virus proteins of <italic>Tomato leaf curl virus</italic> (TLCV) are associated with disease symptoms. Transgenic plants expressing mutated TLCV genes encoding C2, C3, C4, and V1 showed significantly milder symptoms than those expressing the wild type TLCV genes <xref rid="pone.0018094-Selth1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.

Therefore, the lack of association between RDV titer levels and Type 3 gene response may be due to the difference in amino acid sequences among different RDV strains. In RDV, seven structural (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8, and P9) and five non-structural proteins (Pns4, Pns6, Pns10, Pns11 and Pns12) are encoded in the 12 genome segments of double stranded RNA <xref rid="pone.0018094-Omura1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Pns6 is localized to plasmodesmata and identified as necessary for cell-to-cell movement of RDV <xref rid="pone.0018094-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Pns10 functions as a suppressor of gene-silencing processes in host cells <xref rid="pone.0018094-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Sixteen amino acid substitutions in eight virus proteins were specific to RDV-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018094-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), Five of 16 amino acid substitutions in RDV-S were found in P2 protein.

The response of genes involved in GA synthesis and the signaling process by RDV infection indicated that endogenous GA content may decrease in infected plants, and that the decrease may be more drastic in plants infected with RDV-S. Suppression of genes for GA synthesis and signaling could be associated with the difference in P2 protein sequences among RDV strains. In this study, we suggest that disease severity by RDV strains is dependent on the difference in expression of various genes, which is in turn associated with RDV titer level and the variations in virus proteins among RDV strains. In a further study, we would like to investigate the interaction between host and virus proteins to determine the mechanisms of symptom development by RDV infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Virus, insect vector, and plant samples</title><p>The sources of RDV-O and RDV-S were described previously <xref rid="pone.0018094-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

The plants were grown under well-watered conditions in an air-conditioned greenhouse (25&#x000b1;3&#x000b0;C, natural sunlight). Fourteen seedlings at the two-leaf stage in a single pot were exposed to 70 viruliferous or virus-free (for mock inoculation) GLH in an inoculation chamber (34 cm wide by 26 cm deep by 34 cm high) for 24 h (25&#x000b1;3&#x000b0;C, continuous light conditions). After the insects were removed from the plants, the seedlings were placed in an air-conditioned greenhouse (25&#x000b1;3&#x000b0;C, natural sunlight). At 21 dpi, the shoots of the inoculated plants (except the meristem) were cut at 3 cm above the soil surface. After weighing of the samples, they were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. After harvest, rice seedlings were grown continuously in the same greenhouse to evaluate virus infection. The experiment was repeated three times (three biological replicates). The heights of 20 rice plants infected with each RDV strain and 20 mock-inoculated plants were measured at 40 dpi. The significance of difference in plant heights was examined by ANOVA (P-value&#x0003c;0.01) and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test (LSD at 1&#x00025; level).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Detection and quantification of RDV</title><p>RDV infection and concentration were evaluated by the double antibody-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) using an antiserum against RDV described previously <xref rid="pone.0018094-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. To evaluate RDV infection, pieces (about 1 cm) of leaf sheath/stem tissue were harvested from each rice seedling and subjected to DAS-ELISA. To quantify the concentration of RDV in the rice plants, leaf samples were harvested from RDV-infected- and mock-inoculated plants at 30 dpi. After the leaf weight was measured, the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The frozen samples were ground by a multibead shocker (MB501(S), YASUI KIKAI, Osaka, Japan) and were suspended with 10-fold weight of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (10&#x000d7; extracts). The 10&#x000d7; extracts were further serially diluted between 2- and 2<sup>8</sup>-fold with PBS and subjected to DAS-ELISA. The concentration of the coat protein was estimated by comparing absorbance values of RDV-infected rice leaf saps with those of purified RDV of known concentrations at 410 nm. The significance of difference in virus concentrations among plants infected with the RDV strains was examined by ANOVA (P-value&#x0003c;0.05) and LSD test (LSD at 5&#x00025; level).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Sequencing of the RDV genome</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from RDV-infected rice plants using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with random primers. The cDNA of the RDV genome was amplified by PCR using KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The PCR protocol consisted of 1 min at 94&#x000b0;C, followed by 30 cycles of 15 s at 94&#x000b0;C, 15 s at 55&#x000b0;C, and 1 min at 68&#x000b0;C, and final extension time of 5 min at 68&#x000b0;C. PCR products of the expected size were purified by a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and directly sequenced in both directions using an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer with an ABI BigDye terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The nucleotide sequence data were compiled and analyzed with Genetyx-Win version 6 (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Prior to RNA extraction, RDV infection in plants to be used for RNA extraction was examined by DAS-ELISA. For extraction of RNA from RDV-inoculated plants, we used only those confirmed to be infected with RDV. RNA samples were extracted from five independent plants in the same replicates by the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). For this microarray experiment, we prepared 12 RNA samples (three RDV strains and one mock&#x000d7;three biological replicates). The concentration and quality of total RNA were examined by Nanodrop (Nanodrop ND-1000, Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and BioAnalyzer (G2938A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Microarray experiment and data analysis</title><p>To analyze gene responses to RDV infection, we used a two-dye method, which directly compared expression profiles between two samples on the same microarray.

In brief, cyanine 3(Cy3)- or cyanine 5 (Cy5)-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) samples were synthesized from 850 ng of the total RNA using the Low-input RNA labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). In this study, RDV-infected and mock samples were labeled by Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. Hybridization solution was prepared with 825 ng each of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNA preparations using the In situ hybridization kit plus (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Hybridization and washing of microarray slides were performed following the manufacturer's protocols. After being washed, the slide image files were produced by the DNA microarray scanner (G2505B; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).</p><p>Signal intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 were extracted from the image files and normalized in each array by Feature Extraction version 9.5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Signal intensities among all microarray data were normalized according to the quantile method (Global normalization) by EXPANDER ver. 4.1 <xref rid="pone.0018094-Ulitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. A gene was declared &#x0201c;expressed&#x0201d; if the average signal intensity of the gene was higher than 6 in at least one condition; otherwise, the gene was considered not expressed. A DEG was defined as an expressed gene with 1) a log<sub>2</sub>-based ratio (RDV-inoculated sample/mock-inoculated sample) higher than 0.585 or lower than &#x02212;0.585 and 2) significant changes in gene expression of P&#x02264;0.05 by a paired t-test (permutation: all, FDR collection: adjusted Bonferroni method). Data processing was performed using Mev version 4.4 <xref rid="pone.0018094-Saeed1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>.
