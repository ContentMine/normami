The location of the T-DNA inserts, the expression of the flanking genes, and the promoter activity of the genomic DNA upstream of the T-DNA were characterized. The results indicated that the GFP expression pattern in at least one of the lines was due to elements in the intergenic DNA immediately upstream of the T-DNA, rather than due to the activity of the promoters of genes flanking the insert, and provide evidence for the involvement of Dof elements in regulating guard cell gene expression.

The pores are delimited by two stomatal guard cells which respond to a range of environmental and physiological signals to regulate the pore aperture and, consequently, the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> and the release of water vapour by the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroeder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</xref>). Guard cells are symplastically isolated from the remainder of the leaf cells at an early stage in their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Willmer and Sexton, 1979</xref>), making them an attractive system for the study of plant biology at the level of the single cell. Attempts to identify molecular determinants of guard cell functioning and development can be hindered by the difficulties associated with the isolation of guard cells from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which has stomatal complexes smaller than in other species and leaves that do not allow for the easy removal of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To circumvent these difficulties, gene traps based on the expression of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) in guard cells have been used to identify several guard cell expressed genes, including <italic>INWARD RECTIFYING K<sup>+</sup> CHANNEL 1</italic> (<italic>KAT1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <italic>HIGH IN CO<sub>2</sub></italic> (<italic>HIC</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), <italic>CYTOCHROME P450 86A2</italic> (CYP86A2) mono-oxygenase, the <italic>PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 3</italic> (<italic>AtPDR3</italic>) transporter, and a PP2C protein phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbiati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The identification and molecular and physiological characterization of a <italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> enhancer trap population that marks stomatal guard cells or developing stomatal complexes are reported here. <italic>In vivo</italic> imaging of GFP allowed the identification of lines that marked guard cells and lines which track development of stomatal complexes. The <italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> enhancer trap lines contain a construct comprising a <italic>GAL4-VP16</italic> transcriptional activator and a modified <italic>GFP</italic> gene (<italic>mGFP5ER)</italic> under the control of <italic>GAL4</italic> upstream activation sequences (UAS). The construct is randomly located in the genome and reports the activity of endogenous enhancer elements in the vicinity of reporter gene insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haseloff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laplaze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Enhancer elements are autonomous modules that vary in size from about 50 bp to 1.5 kb, with each module performing a specific function, such as activation of its cognate gene at a specific developmental stage or in a specific cell type in a distance and orientation independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackwood and Kadonaga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Struhl, 2001</xref>). Since GFP expression marks the activity of such enhancer modules, enhancer trap lines have been used to identify regulatory sequences responsible for specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsugeki and Fedoroff, 1999</xref>). In cases where the enhancer modules drive cell-specific GFP expression, the lines may be used for fluorescence-based sorting and mapping of the transcriptional profiles of the cell types in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birnbaum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003, 2005</xref>). In addition, the ability easily to visualize GFP expression in the same plant material over extensive timescales has enabled the identification of genes involved in processes such as senescence, responses to oxygen deprivation, and shoot induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swaminathan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cary <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter-Burrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodd <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> utilized a GAL4 GFP enhancer-trap line to target AEQUORIN (AEQ) expression specifically to guard cells, and thus characterize time-of-day dependent alterations in cold-induced increases in cytoplasmic free calcium in guard cells.</p><p>Five GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines have been isolated, four with predominant guard cell expression and one which tracks development of the stomatal complex. It is demonstrated that these lines are not compromised in stomatal function and, as such, might be useful in further analysis of stomatal function. It is shown that guard cell-specific expression of GFP is likely to be driven by proximal elements in the intergenic DNA immediately upstream of the insert. Using one of the guard cell-specific enhancer trap lines along with lines marking other cell types, it is demonstrated that the <italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> lines can be used to track guard cell-derived material in complex mixtures and to compare the efficacy of protoplasting and epidermal fragmentation in isolating pure guard cell RNA samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> enhancer trap lines and their wild-type ecotypes were obtained from the Haseloff and Poethig collections (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">http://www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>).

The GFP expression patterns in these 23 lines were characterized in greater detail over 18 d following germination. GFP was stably expressed in guard mother cells or mature guard cells, and in other parts of the roots or shoot, in 16 of the lines examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the remaining seven lines, GFP was expressed only transiently in some cell or tissue types, suggesting that GFP expression was driven by developmentally regulated enhancers. In one of these lines (E2306), GFP was strongly expressed in the meristemoids and GMCs in both the cotyledons and leaves, but expression became significantly weaker in, or disappeared completely from, both guard cells and subsidiary cells when a stoma was fully formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Southern blots using radioactively labelled GAL4 DNA probes indicated that line E1728 contained a single tandem T-DNA insertion, while lines E361, KS019, and J2103 contained at least two inserts each. This was in contrast to the 19 discarded lines with unstable GFP expression, which carried as many as nine T-DNA inserts. To obtain lines in which GFP was restricted to guard cells, or at least to fewer tissue types, lines E361, KS019, and J2103 were back-crossed with wild-type plants. Single segregants with predominant GFP expression in guard cells and more limited GFP expression in other parts of the plant were isolated from each population.

All lines and their respective wild types lost 10&#x02013;15% of their fresh weight within 40 min of leaf excision, in contrast to the approximately 90% loss in fresh weight recorded for the drought-sensitive positive control (<italic>abscisic acid insensitive 1-1 (abi1-1</italic>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leung <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webb and Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodd <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

By contrast, however, seedlings transformed with constructs containing the <italic>uidA</italic> gene fused to the genomic DNA flanking the inserts in K019-1 and E361-1 did not have any GUS activity in guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E&#x02013;G</xref>). Given the similarity of the GUS activity patterns to the GFP expression patterns in E1728, it was considered likely that the regulatory DNA sequences driving guard cell-specific GFP expression in E1728 were contained within the 1.391 kb genomic DNA fragment adjacent to the T-DNA RB. A motif analysis of this region using PLACE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE">http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE</ext-link>) indicated that it contains eight putative Dof transcription factor binding sites ([T/A]AAAG), which have previously been shown to be sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in guard cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plesch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbiati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). A series of five successive deletions of this region was constructed in an attempt to refine the identity of the guard cell regulatory elements.

The data therefore suggest that GUS expression in guard cells might be dependent on the presence of the six proximal dof transcription factor binding sites, and confirmed that sequences in the genomic DNA upstream of the T-DNA insert in E1728 were likely to be responsible for driving GFP expression in stomatal guard cells.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>GUS activity following fusion of DNA fragments adjacent to the T-DNA RB to the <italic>uidA</italic> reporter gene.

With the exception of E1728, all of the lines initially selected for study had GFP expression in multiple cell/ tissue types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This was not unexpected as many of the lines in the Haseloff <italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> enhancer trap database were initially selected for in a root GFP screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laplaze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and all lines contained more than one T-DNA insert. The presence of multiple inserts may account for the disappearance of GFP in antibiotic-resistant individuals and between generations in many of the lines, as the probability of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagard and Vaucheret, 2000</xref>) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagard and Vaucheret, 2000</xref>) increases with increasing copy number of highly expressed transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lechtenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). This appears to be supported by our observation that the four lines stably expressing GFP had 1&#x02013;2 inserts, while those with variable GFP expression had up to nine inserts. The findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lechtenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, (2003)</xref> that different transgene sequences appear to have different thresholds at which PTGS occurs may also account for the persistence of antibiotic resistance in plants in which no GFP expression was detected. Our data therefore indicate that determination of the number of inserts may be a useful initial step in future screens for stable GFP expressing lines.</p><p>However, not all unstable GFP expression patterns were attributable to gene silencing. The disappearance of GFP expression in some lines followed a clear developmental progression. In line E2306, for example, GFP expression appeared to track stomatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Stomatal development begins with the formation of a meristemoid mother cell (MMC), a stem cell committed to the stomatal pathway that undergoes division to produce a small meristemoid cell, and a larger neighbour cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nadeau and Sack, 2003</xref>). In E2306, the appearance of the meristemoid was marked by the activation of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). GFP expression was maintained through the differentiation of the guard mother cell (GMC), into the guard cells that delimit the stomatal pore, but disappeared entirely in the mature guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Consequently, E2306 may be useful as a marker of stomatal development and as a tool to mis-target genes during early stomatal development.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cary <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> demonstrated that the expression of the <italic>CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1)</italic> gene flanking the T-DNA insert in the <italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> enhancer trap line M0233 replicated the GFP expression pattern. However, our results, consistent with published guard cell microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leonhardt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), indicated that the expression of flanking genes did not mirror the patterns of GFP expression in any of the four lines studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). A similar result has been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsugeki and Fedoroff (1999)</xref> who demonstrated that <italic>ROOT CAP 1 (RCP1</italic>), a gene adjacent to the insert in an enhancer trap line with GUS activity specifically in root cap cells, was expressed throughout the roots and shoots. Instead, fusion of the genomic DNA adjacent to the insert in the enhancer trap line resulted in root cap-specific reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsugeki and Fedoroff, 1999</xref>). Likewise, our analysis indicated that elements in the intergenic region neighbouring the insert in E1728 may be responsible for the observed guard cell-specific GFP expression pattern since fusion of a DNA fragment incorporating the genomic DNA adjacent to the T-DNA insert in E1728 and the <italic>GAL4</italic> TATA box to the <italic>uidA</italic> reporter gene resulted in strong GUS activity in guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3L&#x02013;O</xref>).</p><p>Motif analysis of the intergenic region upstream of the insert in E1728 revealed the presence of at least eight putative Dof transcription factor binding sites. Dof (<underline>D</underline>NA binding with <underline>o</underline>ne <underline>f</underline>inger) transcription factors are a group of transcription factors found exclusively in plants (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yanagisawa, 2002</xref>). Dof transcription factors are thought to regulate plant-specific genes and mediate responses to plant-specific signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yanagisawa, 2002</xref>) including regulation of guard cell-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plesch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbiati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Short DNA fragments encompassing a <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory DNA sequence bound by Dof transcription factors, (T/A)AAAG, were necessary and sufficient for directing guard cell-specific reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plesch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Moreover, a Dof transcription factor, <italic>StDof1</italic>, expressed in potato epidermal fragments, interacts in a sequence-specific manner with a DNA fragment incorporating the TAAAG <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plesch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Dof binding sites have also been identified upstream of guard cell-specific gene traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbiati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and a number of guard cell-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cominelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Collectively, this suggests that the Dof motifs in the DNA upstream of the insert in E1728 might be responsible for driving guard cell GFP expression in E1728. Interestingly, deletion of a single distal Dof binding site terminated GUS expression driven by the DNA fragment upstream of the insert in E1728. This may reflect a requirement for a specific number of Dof binding sites in order to drive GFP expression. This is consistent with the observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plesch <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> that deletion of two of the three TATA box-proximal (T/A)AAAG elements in the <italic>KST1</italic> promoter resulted in a 35&#x02013;40% reduction in the number of independent transgenic lines with GUS activity in guard cells. It is unclear whether the putative guard cell elements identified in E1728 represent either genuine plant enhancer elements which activate expression of an endogenous plant gene in a distance and orientation independent manner, or whether they represent &#x02018;cryptic promoters&#x02019; which are not necessarily involved in the regulation of plant gene expression, but which drive expression of reporter genes when placed in close proximity to a TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plesch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their utility as markers of molecular determinants, GFP expressing lines are useful in tracking individual cell types <italic>in vitro</italic> during purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birnbaum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003, 2005</xref>). The isolation of guard cells from Arabidopsis is particularly problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), but these difficulties have been overcome to some extent by using either epidermal fragmentation or GCP purification. Epidermal fragmentation has been used to study genes involved in the ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> responses of stomatal guard cells of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hugouvieux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zimmermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desikan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The method circumvents the lengthy digestion times used for guard cell protoplasting and the changes in gene expression that occur as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grosset <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leonhardt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, the results indicate that RNA obtained via the epidermal fragmentation method might be heavily contaminated with vascular tissue RNA and, to a lesser extent, trichome RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). In addition, <italic>GFP</italic> was not enriched in epidermal fragments from E1728 (Fig 6B, C) and the guard cell markers <italic>KAT1</italic> and <italic>HIC1</italic> had low expression in epidermal fragments (Fig. 6D). This was despite being able to obtain epidermal fragments with similar purity on a cell count basis to that achieved in other studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hugouvieux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zimmermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desikan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The purity of guard cell samples is of particular importance, as even small contaminants have been shown to generate misleading results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Outlaw <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>). Our findings therefore suggest that epidermal fragmentation of Arabidopsis is unlikely to yield enriched guard cell RNA and that the RNA is contaminated by other cell types. It is demonstrated that GCP purification, by contrast, results in enriched guard cell RNA of high purity. However, care must be taken to control for changes in gene expression caused by protoplasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leonhardt <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). A promising alternative to both methods is laser capture microdissection (LCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kerk <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakazono <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbiati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) which, when coupled to T7 linear RNA amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Gelder <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>) and microarray analysis, may assist in the elucidation of the molecular components underlying guard cell physiology. It is probable that GFP enhancer trap lines such as those detailed in this report may have considerable utility in advancing these methods. Lines JR11-2, KC274, KC380, and KC464, which display GFP expression in mesophyll cells, vascular tissue, trichomes, and epidermal cells, may be used to assess the extent of the contamination of captured material by other cell types, while the guard cell GAL4 GFP lines may be used to confirm the successful capture of guard cells by LCM. Thus, the lines provide a simple measure by which the efficiency of various LCM protocols may be assessed during optimization of the method.</p><p>This report details the characterization of guard cell <italic>GAL4 GFP</italic> enhancer trap lines, and shows that although enhancer trap lines may be used directly for the identification of cell/tissue-specific genes and/or enhancer elements, the efficiency of the discovery process is relatively low. Instead, the lines appear to have greater utility in allowing the tracking of guard cells during development and through isolation procedures. As an illustration of this, use of the lines revealed that a common method of guard cell isolation may not yield samples of sufficient purity and should be re-examined in greater detail. It is hoped that the lines detailed here will aid future attempts to elucidate the molecular features governing the behaviour of stomatal guard cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern292/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> can be found at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Primers used in TAIL PCR, cloning and RT-PCR are provided as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern292/DC1">supplementary material in Tables S1, S2, and S3</ext-link>, respectively.
