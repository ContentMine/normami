A search for novel genes is needed to make a more comprehensive model of pistil and fruit development. Screening for mutants with alterations in fruit morphology generated by an activation tagging strategy resulted in the isolation of the <italic>ctf</italic> (<underline>c</underline>ons<underline>t</underline>ricted <underline>f</underline>ruit) mutant. It is characterized by a) small and wrinkled fruits, with an enlarged replum, an amorphous structure of the septum and an irregular distribution of ovules and seeds; b) ectopic carpelloid structures in sepals bearing ovule-like structures and c) dwarf plants with curled rosette leaves. The overexpressed gene in <italic>ctf</italic> was <italic>AtMYB117</italic>, also named <italic>LOF1 (LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1)</italic>. <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> transcripts were localized in boundary regions of the vegetative shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia and in a group of cells in the adaxial base of petioles and bracts. Transcripts were also detected in the boundaries between each of the four floral whorls and during pistil development in the inner of the medial ridges, the placenta, the base of the ovule primordia, the epidermis of the developing septum and the outer cell layers of the ovule funiculi. Analysis of changes of expression of pistil-related genes in the <italic>ctf</italic> mutant showed an enhancement of <italic>SHATTERPROOF1</italic> (<italic>SHP1</italic>) and <italic>SHP2</italic> expression. All these results suggest that <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> is recruited by a variety of developmental programs for the establishment of boundary regions, including the development of floral organs and the initiation of ovule outgrowth.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meristem activity determines plant development. All above-ground organs, vegetative and reproductive, originate from the shoot apical meristem (SAM). When plants initiate flowering, the vegetative SAM is transformed into an inflorescence meristem (IM). The IM, in turn, generates a collection of undifferentiated cells called floral meristems that give rise to flowers. The flower contains reproductive structures, such as stamens and pistils that enclose the ovules which develop into seeds upon fertilization. Therefore, the fruit with mature seeds is the final product of a developmental process initiated in floral meristems and ovule primordia <xref rid="pone.0018760-Girin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018760-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The transition of meristem into meristem or differentiated tissue involves the formation of boundary layers of cells, also present between adjacent organs, with characteristics of both meristem and fully differentiated cells, such as reduced growth activity. These boundaries are considered reference points for the generation of new meristems and lateral organ primordia <xref rid="pone.0018760-Aida1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> fruit are siliques that originate from pistils constituted of two fused carpels, which are essentially modified leaves <xref rid="pone.0018760-Roeder1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Pistils are composed of the ovary (with ovules and multiple tissues: replum, septum, valves and valve margin), the style and the stigma at the top. Twenty developmental stages have been proposed between the formation of the flower buttress and silique dehiscence, providing common landmarks to describe developmental events <xref rid="pone.0018760-Roeder1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Flower primordia form at stage 2 while the onset of pistil development occurs at stage 6. At stage 7 the pistil grows as a hollow tube. At stage 8, early repla give rise to two medial ridges flanked on both sides by placental tissues. At stage 9, the septum forms when the medial ridges fuse and the placenta produces ovule primordia. The ability to generate differentiated tissues indicates that the early repla possess meristematic characteristics. This meristematic zone does not correspond to a true meristem but a zone of active cell proliferation within the organ that gives rise to specialized and determinate tissues, such as all the marginal tissues of the fruit (replum, septum, ovules, style and stigma), and has therefore been termed a &#x0201c;quasi meristem&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0018760-Girin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The valves and valve margins are the only fruit tissues that develop independently of this meristematic activity. At stage 13, flowers reach anthesis and stigma are pollinated. After fertilization, at stage 14, the pistils are transformed into developing fruit.</p><p>Several genes implicated in pistil and fruit development have been identified. Some genes regulate development and tissue patterning in both SAM and fruit marginal tissues, or in both leaf and fruit lateral tissues, suggesting a common origin of these organs <xref rid="pone.0018760-Girin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018760-Roeder1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018760-Balanza1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. While previously identified genes are certainly important components of flower development, a search for novel genes is needed to form a more comprehensive model of pistil and fruit development.</p><p>Identifying novel genes involved developmental processes often requires bypassing the functional redundancy of genes constituting a family. In this regard, an activation tagging strategy that consists of the insertion of the <italic>Cauliflower Mosaic Virus</italic> (CaMV) 35S enhancers, that act differently than the complete CaMV 35S promoter, has been selected <xref rid="pone.0018760-Weigel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The activation tagging strategy has been successfully used <xref rid="pone.0018760-Kuromori1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> as mutant phenotypes are caused by overexpression rather than knock-out of the targeted gene. Therefore, we used this strategy to search for genes involved in pistil and fruit development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We selected a dominant mutant showing altered fruit morphology that we named <italic>ctf</italic> for <italic><underline>c</underline>ons<underline>t</underline>ricted <underline>f</underline>ruit</italic>. The overexpressed gene in <italic>ctf</italic> was <italic>AtMYB117</italic>, a member of the MYB family of transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0018760-Stracke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018760-Dubos1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>AtMYB117</italic> was recently described as <italic>LOF1</italic> (<italic><underline>L</underline>ATERAL <underline>O</underline>RGAN <underline>F</underline>USION1</italic>), functioning in organ boundary specification, meristem initiation and organ patterning <xref rid="pone.0018760-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. GUS activity in an enhancer-trap line suggests that <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> expression is localized to organ boundaries <xref rid="pone.0018760-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Additionally, in <italic>lof1-1</italic> lines, a T-DNA mutant with a partial phenotype, <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> expression was undetectable in both pedicel nodes and paraclade junctions, in conjunction with visible defects, but was only slightly reduced in inflorescence apex where no phenotypic defects were observed. These results <xref rid="pone.0018760-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and the alterations in the morphology of the fruit in <italic>ctf</italic> prompted us to examine in more detail the expression of <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. In addition, we generated an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) <xref rid="pone.0018760-Schwab1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to silence <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> and <italic>AtMYB105/LOF2</italic> (closely related to <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic>) expression to study a possible role for <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> in the development of reproductive organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and morphological characterization of <italic>ctf</italic> mutants</title><p>To isolate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants with alterations in pistil and fruit development we screened approximately 5000 activation-tagged primary lines and identified a mutant which was named <italic>ctf</italic>, according to its morphological characteristics, that is, a small and wrinkled fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018760-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). T<sub>2</sub> plants segregated for the constricted fruit characteristic in a 1&#x02236;2&#x02236;1 ratio, suggesting a single insertion locus. The fruit phenotype initially observed in heterozygous plants became more severe in homozygous individuals, indicating that the phenotype is determined by a semidominant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018760-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which is consistent with the overexpression of a gene caused by CaMV 35S enhancers. Other remarkable characteristics of homozygous <italic>ctf</italic> fruits were that the replum was wider and the stigmatic papillae were more elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018760-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Therefore, the alterations in fruit tissues might be explained by changes in the intensity of expression of <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic>. CaMV 35S enhancers lead primarily to an enhancement of endogenous expression patterns, the resulting phenotype being a consequence of such an enhancement, as opposed to ectopic overexpression, reflecting the normal role of the activated gene <xref rid="pone.0018760-Weigel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>A remarkable characteristic of <italic>ctf</italic> was the presence in sepals of ectopic carpelloid structures, including stigma, style, transmitting tissue and ovules.

These authors detected <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> expression in the adaxial boundary regions between the SAM and lateral organs during vegetative development and between the inflorescence meristem and flower primordia. We also observed <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> transcripts in the adaxial boundary regions between each of the floral organs, in the boundaries of ovule primordia where they derive from the placenta, in the septum and in the region of ovule primordia that will give rise to the funiculus. To examine a possible role of <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> in the funiculus/ovule development we used amiRNA to obtain a knock-down mutant. Total silencing of <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> and <italic>AtMYB105/LOF2</italic> genes in the inflorescence was not achieved in any of the amiRNA117/105 lines. In spite of the low levels of <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> and <italic>AtMYB105/LOF2</italic> transcripts, the flowers and fruits did not present clear morphological changes. However, we did observe alterations in cellular morphology in the funiculi of some plants. This result, together with the observations mentioned above on <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> expression and the putative genetic relationship with <italic>SHP1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>, might suggest a functional role for <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> in funiculus/ovule development. Further studies will be needed to understand if the <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> gene is essential in ovule initiation and development and if <italic>SHP1</italic> and <italic>SHP2</italic> can be directly or indirectly regulated by the <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> has a similar expression pattern to that of lateral organ boundary genes like <italic>CUC2</italic>, a member of the <italic>NAC</italic> family of transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0018760-Ishida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and <italic>JLO/LBD30</italic>, a member of the <italic>LBD</italic> gene family <xref rid="pone.0018760-Borghi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Like <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic>, these boundary genes are also expressed in the base of ovule primordia. <italic>NAC</italic>, <italic>LBD</italic>, and <italic>GRAS</italic> gene families have been identified as regulators involved in the definition of the boundaries of lateral organ regions <xref rid="pone.0018760-Majer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Some LBD proteins can interact with other partners bearing MYB domains, such as AtAS2/LBD6 and AtASL4/AtLOB, which interact with AtAS1/AtMYB91. Therefore, AtMYB117/LOF1 might be a partner in a multiprotein complex, with a role in different steps and processes of plant development involving lateral organ formation. Fine-scale regulation of developmental processes could be modulated by differential regulation of one or more components, allowing for a great degree of plasticity.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The characterization of the <italic>ctf</italic> mutant, the phenotype of amiRNA117/105 plants and the localization of <italic>AtMYB117/LOF1</italic> transcripts in boundary regions throughout different stages of development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including the initiation of ovule outgrowth, suggest that this gene is recruited in a variety of vegetative and reproductive developmental programs for the establishment of boundary regions and for funiculus/ovule development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>
