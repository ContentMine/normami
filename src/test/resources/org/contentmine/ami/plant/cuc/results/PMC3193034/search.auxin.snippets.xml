  <result pre="Discussion In contrast to the UPR, the NRP-mediated cell death" exact="signaling" post="pathway is a plant-specific ER-stress cell-death response that communicates"/>
  <result pre="plant cells to multiple environmental stimuli. Nevertheless, knowledge about this" exact="signaling" post="pathway is limited to the identification of NRP as"/>
  <result pre="cell death signals. GmNAC6 was linked to NRP-mediated cell death" exact="signaling" post="based on three criteria. First, we showed that GmNAC6"/>
