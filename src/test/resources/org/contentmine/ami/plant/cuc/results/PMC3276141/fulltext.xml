Eight Mutator elements have been fully characterized (<italic>Mu1</italic>, <italic>Mu2</italic> /<italic>Mu1</italic>.<italic>7</italic>, <italic>Mu3</italic>, <italic>Mu4</italic>, <italic>Mu5</italic>, <italic>Mu6/7</italic>, <italic>Mu8</italic>, <italic>MuDR</italic>), and three are defined by TIR (<italic>Mu10</italic>, <italic>Mu11</italic> and <italic>Mu12</italic>). The genome sequencing revealed a complex family of Mu-like-elements (MULEs) in the B73 genome. In this article, we report the identification of a new <italic>Mu</italic> element, named <italic>Mu13</italic>. <italic>Mu13</italic> showed typical <italic>Mu</italic> characteristics by having a &#x0223c;220 bp TIR, creating a 9 bp target site duplication upon insertion, yet the internal sequence is completely different from previously identified <italic>Mu</italic> elements. <italic>Mu13</italic> is not present in the B73 genome or a <italic>Zea mays</italic> subsp. <italic>parviglumis</italic> accession, but in W22 and several inbreds that found the Robertson&#x02019;s <italic>Mutator</italic> line. Analysis of mutants isolated from the UniformMu mutagenic population indicated that the <italic>Mu13</italic> element is active in transposition. Two novel insertions were found in expressed genes. To test other unknown <italic>Mu</italic> elements, we selected six new <italic>Mu</italic> elements from the B73 genome. Southern analysis indicated that most of these elements were present in the UniformMu lines. From these results, we conclude that <italic>Mu13</italic> is a new and active <italic>Mu</italic> element that significantly contributed to the mutagenesis in the UniformMu population.

The two-component system, one autonomous <italic>MuDR</italic> and many nonautonomous <italic>Mu</italic> elements, was exploited for efficient mutagenesis in maize. High copies of the elements offer a high forward mutation frequency, whereas limited copies of <italic>MuDR</italic> allowed turning off the transposition by removing the element through segregation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McCarty <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Preferential transposition into gene rich regions by <italic>Mu</italic> elements enhances mutagenesis frequency. And transposition not limited to linked loci facilitates genome wide mutagenesis. For these reasons, several mutant populations in maize were created by using the <italic>Mu</italic> system (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bensen <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">May <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Raizada 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McCarty <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>The well-characterized <italic>Mu</italic> elements (<italic>Mu1</italic> to <italic>Mu9/MuDR</italic>) were discovered exclusively in maize. Subsequent molecular analyses and genome sequencing revealed that <italic>Mu</italic> elements are present in plants (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lisch 2002</xref>), fungi (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chalvet <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), bacteria (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Eisen <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>), protozoans (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Pritham <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), and metazoans (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hua-Van and Capy 2008</xref>). Based on sequence similarity, these elements are classified as Mu-like elements (MULEs). MULEs belong to a superfamily of transposons with complex members and diverse sequences. Typical characteristics of this family include a conserved 50&#x02013;200bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR), unrelated internal sequences between the TIRs, and creating a 9bp target site duplication (TSD). In contrast, all the previously identified <italic>Mu</italic> elements from maize (<italic>Mu1-Mu9/MuDR</italic>) carry a &#x0223c;220bp TIR that is highly conserved. Transposition activity of the elements is thought to be associated with the TIR sequences. Inactive elements carry mutated TIRs.</p><p>Different from <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> and <italic>Spm/dSpm</italic> transposable elements where the non-autonomous elements are deletion derivatives of the autonomous elements, the internal sequences between TIRs among <italic>Mu</italic> elements are often unrelated. Some <italic>Mu</italic> internal sequences showed high similarity to host genome, suggesting a possible gene capture in the formation of these elements. This class of <italic>Mu</italic> elements was classified as Pack-MULEs (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). About 262 Pack-MULEs were identified in the B73 genome (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Schnable <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Because promoters are found in the TIRs, <italic>Mu</italic> internal sequences may be transcribed in convergent orientations (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hershberger <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lisch 2002</xref>). Hence, it was suspected that some of the Pack-MULEs may have regulatory function, as antisense transcripts may interfere with expression of the endogenous genes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lisch 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Juretic <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>Transposition of all <italic>Mu</italic> elements required the presence of an active <italic>MuDR</italic> element. The <italic>MuDR</italic> element contains two genes, <italic>mudrA</italic> encoding a transposase (MURA) and <italic>mudrB</italic> whose product (MURB) is of unknown function. MURA showed high similarity to bacterial transposase and the virus integrase (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Walbot and Rudenko 2002</xref>); hence, it is essential for transposition. Transposable elements containing only <italic>mudrA</italic>-like genes were found in both monocots and eudicots (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Saccaro <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The <italic>mudrB</italic> gene is only present in the genus <italic>Zea</italic> (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lisch <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). <italic>Jittery</italic>, an autonomous transposon identified in maize, contains a <italic>mudrA</italic>-like gene, but with TIR sequences distinct from <italic>Mu</italic> elements (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). <italic>Jittery</italic> exhibited high frequency of excision, causing somatic and germinal reversion, but apparently lost its activity for new insertions. Transposition of <italic>Mu</italic> elements employs two distinct mechanisms. In somatic cells, transposition mostly uses a &#x0201c;cut-and-paste&#x0201d; mechanism. The element cuts itself and reinserts it in a new locus elsewhere in the genome. High-frequency excision of <italic>Mu</italic> elements is restricted to the late stage of cells in development during organogenesis. In germinal cells, <italic>Mu</italic> transposition uses a &#x0201c;replicate-and-insert&#x0201d; mechanism where the element replicates just before meiosis or in the gametophytes and inserts in a new locus in the genome. Consequently, &#x0201c;cut and paste&#x0201d; transposition does not increase the copy number, whereas &#x0201c;duplicate-and-insert&#x0201d; transposition does. Excision of a <italic>Mu</italic> element left a footprint of the 9bp TSD, which sometimes restored the function of the donor gene such as in <italic>bz1-mum9</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McCarty <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>Prior to the sequencing of the maize genome, eleven <italic>Mu</italic> elements were reported in maize, of which eight were characterized by full sequences, (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>Mu1</italic>, <italic>Mu2</italic> /<italic>Mu1</italic>.<italic>7</italic>, <italic>Mu3</italic>, <italic>Mu4</italic>, <italic>Mu5</italic>, <italic>Mu6/7</italic>, <italic>Mu8</italic> and <italic>MuDR</italic>) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bennetzen <italic>et al.</italic> 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Walbot 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Talbert <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fleenor <italic>et al.</italic> 1990</xref>), and three were indicated by TIRs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). The sequencing of the B73 genome revealed a surprisingly complex view of the <italic>Mutator</italic> family, which accounts for approximately 1% of the 2.3 gbp genome (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Schnable <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). These include MULEs, Pack-MULEs, and SOLOs that contain only one TIR. Many of these elements contain a shorter TIR, suggesting that these elements may have lost the capacity for transposition. In this study, we report a new <italic>Mu</italic> element, <italic>Mu13</italic>, which was identified from the UniformMu population, a derivative <italic>Mu</italic> active line from the Robertson&#x02019;s <italic>Mu</italic> line. <italic>Mu13</italic> exhibits typical <italic>Mu</italic> characteristics and is active in transposition. It contributes significantly to mutagenesis. The finding of <italic>Mu13</italic> adds to the active <italic>Mu</italic> reservoir and facilitates cloning of causative insertions in the <italic>Mu</italic> tagged mutants in phenotype-driven forward genetics in maize.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Genetic stocks</title><p>The maize lines used in this study were derived from the UniformMu population, a <italic>Mutator</italic> line with the mutable <italic>bz1-mum9</italic> anthocyanin biosynthetic gene introgressed into the W22 genetic background (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McCarty <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).

As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the first highly similar ORF started from the first methionine and covered 73 amino acid (aa) residues in length. This region shared an 88% identity with the maize WD40 protein, and a similar identity with apparent orthologs in sorghum (Sb01g008680) and rice (Os03g0738700, also identified as Os03g52870, annotated as transducin family protein). The second highly similar region (95% identity) was about 42 aa long and coincided with the first repeat of the WD40 protein. In the maize WD40 protein, these two regions were separated by 26 amino acid residues, which were not found in the <italic>Mu13</italic>. This maize WD40 gene was expressed as indicated by ESTs, suggesting that it may be a functional gene.

The genotype of each F2 individual was scored by examining the ear.

Both insertions were novel, as they were not present in the progenitors and were segregated specifically in individual lines. We cloned and sequenced the inserted <italic>Mu</italic> elements.

We used the conserved 200bp <italic>Mu</italic> TIR sequences and performed a BLAST search of the maize genomic sequences in GenBank. A high stringency search (E value &#x0003c; e<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>) resulted in a low return of <italic>Mu</italic> elements. It appears that four types of <italic>Mu</italic> elements with distinct TIRs are present in the B73 genome. One class of <italic>Mu</italic> elements possesses TIRs with high similarity to known <italic>Mu</italic> elements in sequence and length (left and right TIR &#x0223c;210 bp). A second class contains a left TIR of &#x0223c;215bp and a short right TIR of &#x0223c;90bp. A third class contains both short TIRs (&#x0223c;100bp), and a fourth class is called SOLOs, which contain only one TIR. The previously known <italic>Mu</italic> elements only account for a very small fraction of this family. <italic>Mu1</italic>, <italic>Mu2</italic>, <italic>Mu8</italic>, and <italic>Mu13</italic> do not exist in the B73 genome.

Because of the absence of <italic>MuDR</italic>, these elements are dormant, and some may have lost their transposition activity due to accumulated mutations. To analyze the presence and possible activity of the unknown <italic>Mu</italic> elements in the UniformMu population, we identified a subset of MULEs from the B73 genome. The criteria are that the element <italic>1</italic>) contains a highly conserved &#x0223c;220bp TIR on both ends (&#x0003e;85% identity to consensus <italic>Mu</italic> TIR sequence); <italic>2</italic>) contains perfect TIR ends (GAGATA at the 5&#x02032; and TATCTC at 3&#x02032;); and <italic>3</italic>) possesses perfect TSD in the insertion site, which is indicative for recent transposition. The known active <italic>Mu</italic> elements all contain these features.

Sequence analysis strongly supports the notion that <italic>Mu1</italic> is a deletion derivative of <italic>Mu2</italic>, and that <italic>Mu5</italic> a deletion derivative of <italic>MuDR</italic>. <italic>Mu2</italic> contains a 140bp direct repeat in the internal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, box arrows). Its 3&#x02032; region (from 893 to 1330bp) showed a 91% identity to maize and rice genomic sequences, suggesting possible gene fragment capture. The conceptual translation product of this region showed high similarity (80% identity) to Os05g0128200, which was annotated as zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 33 in rice. In sequence alignment with <italic>Mu2</italic>, <italic>Mu1</italic> lacks most of this region, but still retains a residual 41 bp of the likely captured fragment. Similarly, <italic>Mu5</italic> contains two segments of the <italic>mudrA</italic> gene that codes for MURA transposase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>Mu15</italic> showed slight similarity to <italic>Mu19</italic>, in which three short segments of the internal sequences shared some similarity, suggesting that the two elements are likely of the same origin.

As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the <italic>Mu13</italic> element contains two regions that showed high similarity to a WD40 protein. <italic>Mu14</italic> contains a fragment highly similar (89% identity) to a putative cucumisin-like serine protease on chromosome 1. <italic>Mu15</italic> contains a fragment that is similar to xylem serine proteinase 1 on chromosome 1 (LOC100281759). <italic>Mu16</italic> contains a fragment similar to a receptor protein kinase TMK precursor (95% identity, Accession no.

HM004530, 97% identity at nt level) and a calmodulin (LOC100286292, 98% identity at nt level). <italic>Mu19</italic> contains a fragment of a putative xylem serine proteinase 1 (Accession no.

All of these elements except <italic>MuDR</italic> are between 1.4 and 2.5 kb in length.</p><p>We cloned the internal sequences of these <italic>Mu</italic> elements and used them as probes to test their presence in inbred lines Mo17, W22, and six randomly selected UniformMu mutant lines. As shown in a Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), <italic>Mu14</italic> to <italic>Mu18</italic> elements were found in W22 and the UniformMu lines. The identical sizes of the fragments between W22 and the UniformMu lines strongly suggested that these elements were likely derived from W22. <italic>Mu19</italic> was not found in Mo17, W22, or the UniformMu lines, but was found in B73. The analysis revealed that these elements represent part of the non-colinear genome fraction of the three inbred lines. B73, Mo17, and W22 were all variable for these six elements in terms of copy numbers and RFLP size. <italic>Mu19</italic> was not present in either Mo17 or W22. It was also not detected in the six UniformMu lines. Some elements showed identical size among the three inbred lines, indicating likely early transposition events prior the separation of these inbreds. These <italic>Mu</italic> elements in the UniformMu population were derived from W22. Within the limited number of the UniformMu samples, new transposition events were not detected.</p><fig id="fig6" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 6&#x02002;</label><caption><p>Presence of the new <italic>Mu</italic> elements in W22, Mo17, and the UniformMu line.

Different <italic>Mu</italic> elements are defined by the internal sequences between the TIRs. <italic>Mu13</italic> has a TIR of 223bp that is highly similar to the conserved TIR sequences of known <italic>Mu</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and yet the internal sequence is completely different from known <italic>Mu</italic> elements. <italic>Mu13</italic> element was not found in the sequenced B73 genome, nor was it detected by Southern hybridization analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Of the two <italic>Mu13</italic> insertions identified in this study, each created a 9bp TSD. Hence, we concluded that <italic>Mu13</italic> is a new <italic>Mu</italic> element.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title><italic>Mu13</italic> contributes significantly to mutagenesis in the UniformMu population</title><p>Among the previously identified <italic>Mu</italic> elements, not all are equally active in transposition. <italic>Mu</italic> element transposition was driven by the autonomous element <italic>MuDR</italic> (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hershberger <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>). <italic>Mu4</italic> and <italic>Mu5</italic> were found inactive (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Talbert <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>), which may likely be due to the absence of the <italic>MuDR</italic> element. However, in a large scale tagging of <italic>gl8</italic> locus, 58% insertions were caused by <italic>Mu1</italic>/<italic>Mu2</italic>, 25% by <italic>MuDR</italic>, 7% by <italic>Mu11</italic>, and the remaining elements (<italic>Mu8</italic>, <italic>Mu12</italic>, <italic>Mu4</italic> and <italic>Mu10</italic>) collectively merely contributed to 10% (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Our analysis of the known <italic>Mu</italic> element transposition events in the UniformMu population showed somewhat different presentation. <italic>Mu1</italic> showed higher frequency of transposition, followed by <italic>Mu3</italic>, <italic>Mu8</italic>, and <italic>MuDR</italic> (B. C. Tan and D. R. McCarty, unpublished data).</p><p>We have provided evidence that <italic>Mu13</italic> is active by analyzing new transposition events in a random selection of the UniformMu mutant lines, as well as by identification of <italic>Mu13</italic> insertions in two functional genes. After the initial identification of <italic>Mu13</italic>, we recovered another <italic>Mu13</italic> insertion in one of two insertions analyzed. These results indicated that <italic>Mu13</italic> is highly active in transposition in the UniformMu population. Conceivably, if <italic>Mu13</italic> is present in other <italic>Mu</italic> active lines, it should contribute significantly to mutagenesis as well. All the <italic>Mu</italic> active lines were derived from a single line from which <italic>Mu</italic> transposable elements were discovered (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chandler and Hardeman 1992</xref>). The UniformMu population was derived by introgressing Robertson&#x02019;s <italic>Mu</italic> active line into inbred W22. Robertson maintained the <italic>Mu</italic> activity by out-crossing with W23; thereby <italic>Mu13</italic> could have been derived from W23. However, our Southern blot analysis as well as PCR detection confirmed the presence of <italic>Mu13</italic> in W22. Comparison of the fragment sizes of <italic>Mu13</italic> inserted elements between W22 and the UniformMu lines indicated that they are identical. Unless W23 contained the similar <italic>Mu13</italic> insertions, the <italic>Mu13</italic> elements in the UniformMu population appeared to be derived from W22. Hence, it is possible that the introgression of <italic>MuDR</italic> elements from the <italic>Mu</italic> active line activated the <italic>Mu13</italic> element in the W22. It would be interesting to test the presence of the <italic>Mu13</italic> element in other mutagenesis populations, such as the Maize-targeted mutagenesis population (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">May <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and the Pioneer Hi-Bred International&#x02019;s Trait Utility System in Corn collection (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bensen <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Unidentified <italic>Mu</italic> elements in the maize genome and their activity</title><p>The identification of active <italic>Mu13</italic> in the maize genome suggested that there are many more unknown <italic>Mu</italic> elements in the genome. The sequencing of the B73 genome recovered many of these elements (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Schnable <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), but evidence suggested that there are more. We have analyzed six <italic>Mu</italic> elements identified in B73, and <italic>Mu19</italic> was not detected in the UniformMu population, which is largely W22 introgressed with the Robertson&#x02019;s active <italic>Mu</italic> line. <italic>Mu13</italic> was not found in the B73 genome, and in the tagging of 80 alleles of <italic>gl8</italic>, <italic>Mu13</italic> was not detected in the population that derived from the Robertson&#x02019;s Mu-active line. <italic>Mu13</italic> apparently was present in W22 and was activated during introgressing with Mu-active lines. The W22 line did not contain any active <italic>MuDR</italic> element (B. C. Tan and D. R. McCarty, unpublished data), hence <italic>Mu13</italic> was inactive. Because different maize inbred lines harbor different spectrums of <italic>Mu</italic> elements, more unknown <italic>Mu</italic> elements are expected. It is highly likely that most of the maize inbred lines did not contain any active <italic>MuDR</italic> elements, hence all the <italic>MuDR</italic> driven <italic>Mu</italic> elements are dormant. Upon introducing the <italic>MuDR</italic> element, <italic>Mu</italic> element activity may be restored. If this is the case, Southern blot based cosegregation analysis using known <italic>Mu</italic> internal sequences as probes may encounter some problems. But this will not affect analysis based on the TIR sequences such as AIMS (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Frey <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), Mu-TAIL PCR (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Settles <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), AIMS and Mu-TAIL-PCR combined (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Yi <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and the use of PCR-coupled with pyrosequencing (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Williams-Carrier <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). In addition, if the creation of new <italic>Mu</italic> elements is associated with the <italic>MuDR</italic> activity, it will be expected that there will be many new <italic>Mu</italic> elements in Robertson&#x02019;s Mu-active line. It will be interesting to know the <italic>Mu</italic> landscape in the Robertson <italic>Mu</italic> active line.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center for providing genetic materials, Donald R.
