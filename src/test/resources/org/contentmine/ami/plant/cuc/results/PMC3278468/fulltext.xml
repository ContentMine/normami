Given LCOs' structural similarity to pathogen-response-eliciting chitin oligomers, foliar application of LCOs was tested for ability to induce stress-related genes under optimal growth conditions. In order to study the effects of LCO foliar spray under stressed conditions, soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) seedlings grown at optimal temperature were transferred to sub-optimal temperature. After a 5-day acclimation period, the first trifoliate leaves were sprayed with 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO (NodBj-V (C<sub>18&#x02236;1</sub>, MeFuc)) purified from genistein-induced <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic> culture, and harvested at 0 and 48 h following treatment. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; Soybean Genome Arrays. Compared to the control at 48 h after LCO treatment, a total of 147 genes were differentially expressed as a result of LCO treatment, including a number of stress-related genes and transcription factors. In addition, during the 48 h time period following foliar spray application, over a thousand genes exhibited differential expression, including hundreds of those specific to the LCO-treated plants. Our results indicated that the dynamic soybean foliar transcriptome was highly responsive to LCO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) validated the microarray data.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="22"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The legume-rhizobia N<sub>2</sub>-fixation symbiosis is one of the most intensively studied and best characterized plant-microbe interactions because it is the most inexpensive and environmental-friendly source of nitrogen for crop production <xref rid="pone.0031571-Gage1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The establishment of the symbiotic relationship involves a signal exchange between the host legume and the N<sub>2</sub>-fixing rhizobia. Legume roots exude (Iso) flavonoids that act as a chemoattractant to rhizobia and induce the rhizobial <italic>nod</italic> genes <xref rid="pone.0031571-Currier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Firmin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As a result, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), also known as Nod factors, are synthesized by rhizobia and excreted as the host-specific rhizobia-to-plant signals <xref rid="pone.0031571-DHaeze1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Denarie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. They can be perceived by multiple receptors in host roots and trigger a cascade of signaling events, which are essential for bacterial invasion of the host roots, leading to the formation of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing root nodules <xref rid="pone.0031571-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The host plant responses upon exposure to LCOs can be categorized as nodulation-related and non-nodulation-related. The former consists of four events: 1) root hair curling and deformation, 2) electrophysiological responses including ion fluxes, 3) formation of infection threads and development of nodules, 4) activation of early <italic>nodulin</italic> (<italic>enod</italic>) genes in host plants, which encode proteins responsible for early nodule development <xref rid="pone.0031571-Denarie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031571-Ramu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. LCOs are viewed as a potential class of plant growth regulators <xref rid="pone.0031571-Denarie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and are known to participate in plant development and morphogenesis <xref rid="pone.0031571-Dyachok1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031571-Khan2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, as well as abiotic and biotic stress responses <xref rid="pone.0031571-Duzan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031571-Atti1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Hence, the effects of LCOs outside the context of nodulation are of particular interest.</p><p>Microarray studies have previously been carried out on several legume-rhizobia symbiotic systems, illustrating differentially expressed plant genes due to rhizobia infection, nodule development and the onset of N<sub>2</sub>-fixation <xref rid="pone.0031571-Asamizu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031571-ElYahyaoui1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The numerous differentially expressed genes identified in various studies are diverse in class, function, expression level and pattern, however, in general 1) nodulation strongly affects metabolism, 2) plant defense mechanisms are engaged, particularly during the early stages of rhizobial infection, 3) genes usually involved in a variety of regulatory components, such as transcription factors, are affected <xref rid="pone.0031571-Brechenmacher1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Colebatch1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031571-Mitra1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nonetheless, the profile of the host transcriptome upon the perception of LCOs in the absence of rhizobia has not been well characterized.</p><p>Lindsay <xref rid="pone.0031571-Lindsay1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> found that under optimal growth conditions over 600 soybean genes were differentially expressed 48 h after foliar spray with of LCO (NodBj-V (C<sub>18&#x02236;1</sub>, MeFuc), the bulk of these being related to defense and stress responses. <italic>Nodulin</italic> homologues were also found to be differentially expressed, indicating the possible presence of LCO receptors in the leaves <xref rid="pone.0031571-Lindsay1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast to root application, foliar application of LCOs is a relatively new approach for studying their effects and possible roles. It is quite intriguing that a signal compound from the rhizosphere can trigger responses when applied elsewhere on a plant. However, this novel finding facilitates investigation of LCO effects outside the context of nodulation. Among the thousands of differentially expressed genes revealed so far by microarray investigations of nodulating roots, a significant percentage are clearly nodulation-related <xref rid="pone.0031571-Brechenmacher1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Because foliar application of LCOs will not lead to the formation of nodules, it will allow us to elucidate general LCO responses, in the absence of specific nodulation related responses. Furthermore, the early signaling events in roots following the exposure of LCOs are highly localized, with only a small portion of the root tissue responding. In this regard, harvesting the entire root system may result in tissue dilution, while separating the root sections at harvest are not practically achievable <xref rid="pone.0031571-Brechenmacher1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Using leaf material avoids such problems and may increase the sensitivity of gene expression detection. Moreover, leaves are above-ground and clearly visible, hence it is easier to control the uniformity of the material and the amount of LCO spray applied, which are important in reducing variability in the microarray data analysis.</p><p>A number of lines of evidence indicate a relationship between LCOs and host stress response in the absence of external stress; hence the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of LCOs under stress. Low temperature is an appropriate stress condition and a common stress factor during early spring growing conditions for soybean in Eastern Canada. It has previously been reported that the symbiotic interaction is temperature-sensitive, especially during rhizobial infection and nodule development <xref rid="pone.0031571-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, yet the rhizobia-legume symbiosis is almost always established under sub-optimal temperatures in temperate zones <xref rid="pone.0031571-Prevost1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. With this in mind, we considered that our investigation would be particularly meaningful if carried out under naturally-occurring conditions. The objective of this work was to investigate the gene expression profile of soybean leaves, under stressed and non-stressed conditions, after foliar application of the LCO NodBj-V (C<sub>18&#x02236;1</sub>, MeFuc) using Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; analysis to screen a large number of soybean transcripts, with a particular focus on genes involved in stress regulation. Thus, we have examined changes in the patterns of gene expression, particularly stress response related genes, of plants already under stressful conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We have studied the effects of LCO from <italic>B. japonicum</italic> strain 532C on the gene expression profile of soybean leaves following spray application at a sub-optimal growth temperature (15&#x000b0;C), corresponding to typical spring field conditions of eastern Canada.</p><p>The first trifoliate leaves of the control and LCO-treated soybean plants (cv.

Due to the very strict criteria for difference detection during data analysis (the selection of relevant genes was based on the overlap of the sets of genes whose expression levels were altered as detected by all 3 alogrithms used) it is possible that some genes responding to LCO treatment may have been missed. However, treated leaves with a material normally thought to be active when applied to roots and, because truly exceptional findings require exceptionally reliable proof. We have used a very cautious approach by using the same stringent statistical approach for all gene sets examined and conclude that the results are unbiased and reliable .

Four gene lists were compiled based on the four pair-wise comparisons (or contrasts) of gene expression profiles i.e., list 1 is a set of genes differentially expressed in the dH<sub>2</sub>O control and 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO-treated plants when the leaves were harvested at 0 h after foliar spray; whereas list 2 contains the genes differentially expressed between the dH<sub>2</sub>O control and 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO-treated plants 48 h after the foliar spray.

Although, contrast 1 was excluded from further bioinformatics analysis due to the empty gene list, its importance should not be overlooked; it serves a number of important functions crucial to an accurate interpretation of the other three gene lists. First, the zero output of contrast 1 testifies to the rigor of the statistical methodology used in this study. While some studies in the literature have used only one statistical algorithm for microarray data analysis, such as Cyber-T or LPE <xref rid="pone.0031571-Patten1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, three algorithms were used in this study, and only the overlapping output was deposited into the final gene list. While this data &#x0201c;trimming&#x0201d; procedure might lead to the discovery of fewer differentially expressed genes, it is necessary to minimze false positives and avoiding misleading data. Our evidence indicated that EB (Rocke) was the most stringent algorithm. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031571-t001">Table 1</xref>, with the exception of contrast 3, EB (Rocke) yielded the smallest number of differentially expressed genes, and the lowest percentage excluded output. In contrast 1, a number of differentially expressed genes were identified by the Cyber-T and LPE statistical algorithms, but none was identified by EB (Rocke); on the other hand, although stringent, EB (Rocke) still had an exclusion percentage between 10 to 30&#x00025; in the other three contrasts. The use of three algorithms instead of one has provided results that can be accepted with a high degree of confidence, avoiding data points that could otherwise be misleading. Further, the seven genes chosen from gene list 2 were successfully validated through the qPCR approach. Collectively, these lines of evidence demonstrate that the statistical method used for data analysis in this study was reliable and rigorous in distinguishing signal from noise, providing a reliable basis for the correct interpretation of all other results. In addition, the average CV for the data from control and LCO-treated plants harvested at 0 h were both below 10&#x00025;. This argues that the absence of statistical significance in contrast 1 data was not a result of high variability. Furthermore, the zero output in gene list 1 indicated the absence of detectable very early signaling events triggered by 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO foliar spray. According to previous studies, subnanomolar concentrations of LCOs caused rapid electrophysiological changes within minutes on host root hairs and non-host cell suspension cultures <xref rid="pone.0031571-Felle1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Kuchitsu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It is possible that the sub-optimal temperature desensitized soybean trifoliates, so that they responded to the LCO treatment slowly; lower growth temperatures are almost certain to result in slower responses in a non-homeotherm. Another explanation is that the early responses to LCOs are strictly physiological, where existing proteins were activated to pump ions across membranes, without any changes in gene expression activity. In fact, if differential gene expression were detected in contrast 1, it would have been uncertain as to whether this, or any other of the changes, resulted from background noise, experimental variability, error, or true effects triggered by LCO treatment. The zero output in contrast 1 eliminates all of these possibilities; therefore we can be affirmative regarding the stringency of statistical methods, uniformity of plants and experimental conditions, as well as the absence of early signaling events at the gene expression level.</p><p>A total of 482 down-regulated genes and 355 up-regulated genes were shared by contrasts 3 and 4; the overlapping genes account for 53&#x00025; of the genes in list 3, and 66&#x00025; of the genes in list 4, indicating that over half of the genes that were differentially expressed as the plants developed genes were common to both control and LCO-treated plants, although the magnitude of differential expression sometimes differed between the two groups. Functional categorization of these overlapping genes has indicated common transcription activities in the two groups of plants. The data indicate that plants in both contrasts were subject to maturation and aging, as reflected by a number of the gene activity changes, while adapting to the low temperature at the same time. There was also a significant number of overlapping components involved in both secondary metabolism and stress response. The overlapping gene lists of contrasts 3 and 4 also revealed the differential expression of an abundance of genes involved in various aspects of protein metabolism, such as protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, folding, translation, and proteolysis, including a variety of differentially expressed protein kinases. These genes may be involved in signaling and transcription regulation.</p><p>After eliminating overlapping genes indicated by contrast 4, 393 down-regulated and 339 up-regulated genes were unique to contrast 3. Taken together with the overlapping genes described above, this gene list provides further information regarding gene expression activities unique to the control plants during the biological events occurring by 48 h after treatment, including aging, development, cold acclimation, and stress responses.</p><p>The differential expression of genes related to defence and abiotic stress at 15&#x000b0;C indicated by contrast 3 followed a similar temporal pattern to that of the overlapping gene list. The annotation for many of these genes were the same as that in the overlapping gene list, suggesting that the genes unique to gene list 3 were transcribed from different loci of the same gene family. After removal of overlapping genes demonstrated through contrast 3, 226 down-regulated and 197 up-regulated genes were unique to contrast 4. Genes in this list were differentially expressed, during the 48 h post treatment period, in response to LCO foliar spray. The presence of genes unique to contrast 4 suggests that apart from fine-tuning existing signaling pathways, LCO foliar application induces novel signaling pathways, which eventually leads to differential gene expression by 48 h after treatment, as indicated by contrast 2.</p><p>Genes encoding defence-related products unique to contrast 4 were detected, including the down-regulated defence resistance protein, as well as the up-regulated PAL, chitinase, multi-antimicrobial extrusion protein (MatE), and lipoxygenase. Accepted as a PR-protein, chitinase is represented by subfamilies of PR-3, 4 and 8 <xref rid="pone.0031571-Felle1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Chitinase can be induced by a variety of biotic and abiotic stress conditions, as well as SA, JA and ethylene; in addition to enhancing disease resistance during pathogen attack, chitinase suppresses host defence responses in plant-rhizobial and plant-mycorrhizal interactions; chitinase also plays roles in growth, embryogenesis and cold resistance <xref rid="pone.0031571-Kasprzewska1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is very interesting that chitinase has been shown to accumulate under frost conditions and contributes to plant freezing tolerance <xref rid="pone.0031571-Kasprzewska1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The induction of chitinase genes in contrast 4 may have indicated interactions between LCO treatment and cold stress. Encoded by a large gene family, MatE proteins are transporters responsible for the detoxification of heavy metals and toxic secondary metabolites; they have also been shown to participate in SA-dependent defence signaling <xref rid="pone.0031571-Moriyama1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>A number of genes associated with development and organization were found to be unique to contrast 4, such as the down-regulated expansin, together with the up-regulated histone H1, and NAC secondary cell wall thickening promoting factor (NST). Histone H1, a linker histone in eukaryotic chromatin, stabilizes chromatin higher-order structures <xref rid="pone.0031571-Wierzbicki1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>). It is noteworthy that as histone H1 exists in numerous isoforms, the differential expression of a few orthologue genes is not likely to cause any fluctuation in global histone H1 level <xref rid="pone.0031571-Wierzbicki1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NSTs include the functionally-redundant NST1 and NST2, which are NAC-domain containing transcription factors regulating secondary cell wall thickening in various tissues <xref rid="pone.0031571-Mitsuda1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Given the suppression of expansion and induction of NSTs, it is apparent that plants in contrast 4 had ceased expansion and started the synthesis of secondary cell walls. The same conclusion was drawn from contrast 3; nonetheless, in the control and LCO-treated plants, different gene loci were involved regarding secondary growth.</p><p>Similar to contrast 3, genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in contrast 4 were mostly down-regulated, while those involved in secondary metabolism were mainly up-regulated, such as flavonoid biosynthesis-related CHS and CHI, as well as the JA biosynthesis-related LOX, and secondary cell wall synthesis-related cellulose. As discussed above, many of these genes were members of the cytochrome P450 family. It is interesting that CHS, CHI and LOX are defence-related genes as well. The induction of these genes in contrast 4 may be related to the elicitor-nature of LCO, or cross-talk between secondary development and LCO-induced responses.</p><p>The data obtained from microarray analysis of soybean first trifoliate leaves sprayed with 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO at 15&#x000b0;C revealed the differential expression of 147 genes at 48 h after treatment, compared with the water control. Functional analysis of these genes led to the identification of genetic components associated with biotic/abiotic stress, signal transduction, development, primary and secondary metabolism, as well as transport. Of all the functional categories, unknown genes comprised the largest proportion (close to 30&#x00025;), followed by stress-related genes (around 17&#x00025;). A further breakdown of the stress-related genes led to the revelation of components involved in defense, oxidative stress, cold acclimation, hormonal response, MAPK cascade, phosphate deficiency and sulfolipid metabolism. Evidence also indicated probable cross-talk between LCO-induced response and cold acclimation.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Effects of 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO foliar application on soybean gene expression at 15&#x000b0;C after 48 h</title><p>A total of 147 genes were differentially expressed 48 h after treatment with 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M LCO foliar spray at 15&#x000b0;C, including 65 down-regulated genes and 82 up-regulated.

The plant immune system is of two types, 1) transmembrane pattern recognition receptors acting in response to gradually evolving microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns and 2) a response that is basically inside the cell, using the polymorphic NB-LRR protein products of R genes that are named after their characteristic nucleotide binding (NB) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains. Pathogen effectors can be recognized by NB-LRR proteins, and mediate matching defence responses. NB-LRR-mediated immune reponse is noticeable against pathogens that propogate on living host tissue, such as obligate biotrophs, or hemi-biotrophic pathogens, however it is not effective against necrotrophs i.e. pathogens that result in host tissue death following colonization <xref rid="pone.0031571-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Two genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism were up-regulated, including sphingolipid long chain base &#x00394;-8 desaturase and glucoceramide synthase, which may also be involved in the LCO-induced defense signaling. Ceramide is the core component of sphingolipid metabolic pathways. Interestingly, as the product of &#x00394;-8 desaturase serves as the substrate of glucoceramide synthase, it was observed that &#x00394;-8 desaturase activity is enhanced in the presence of glucoceramide <xref rid="pone.0031571-Sperling1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, which explains why both genes were up-regulated in our study. Plant sphingolipids are involved in signal transduction, membrane stability, host-pathogen interactions and stress responses <xref rid="pone.0031571-Sperling1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Sphingolipid confers membrane stability to plants, thus contributing to plant acclimation to drought and cold stress.

Thus in our case, the induction of these two genes may be an indication of cross-talk between cold and LCO signaling, but it cannot be determined whether this induction contributes to cold tolerance of the LCO-treated plants. In addition, fungal cerebrosides, which are glycosylated sphigolipids, are pathogenic elicitors leading to hypersensitive response, phytoalexin accumulation and cell death; this elicitation is dependent on the &#x00394;-8 double bond <xref rid="pone.0031571-Sperling1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Changes in the expression levels of many protein kinases and phosphatases were detected, including the down-regulated homologues of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C). The MAPK cascade is an important signal transduction pathway in plants, functioning in cell devision, differentiation, and hormonal response, as well as a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses; the cascade is a series of phosphorylation-dependent activations of MAPK components, starting with the activation of MAPK upon phosphorylation by MAPKK (MAPK kinase), which itself is activated by MAPKKK (MAPKK kinase) <xref rid="pone.0031571-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.

Since most of the qPCR p-values were higher than 0.3, it is reasonable to assume that the expression levels of these genes were not affected by LCO treatment at 0 h. However, our results also indicate that qPCR validation is still necessary for microarray discoveries, as some minor disagreement in statistical significance was still found for one of the 7 validated genes. The qPCR results revealed a down-regulation of the <italic>TCP</italic> gene by 1.2 fold, but it was not statistically significant. A number of factors might have contributed to this disagreement. First, the amplification-based qPCR method is more sensitive and accurate in gene quantification, while the hybridization-based microarray technique is more powerful in large-scale gene expression analysis <xref rid="pone.0031571-Czechowski1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Kawasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Also, only 3 biological replicates were used for microarray analysis in this study, while 6 biological replicates were used for qPCR validation. Thus, it is reasonable that the fold change and significance levels derived from the two methods were similar but not identical. Further, the TCP gene encodes a transcription factor generally expressed at low levels. It is suggested in other studies that accurate quantification by microarray is challenged by low transcript abundance, such as in the case of transcription factors; the low hybridization signal of rare transcripts is often treated as background noise, while lowering the detection threshold leads to higher rates of false positives <xref rid="pone.0031571-ElYahyaoui1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Colebatch1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031571-Colebatch2" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. High throughput qPCR profiling was shown to be a better alternative to quantify transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0031571-Czechowski1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. As indicated by previous studies, more emphasis should be placed on the direction of gene expression change indicated by microarray, rather than the magnitude of change <xref rid="pone.0031571-Yauk1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>.</p><p>Although previous studies have shown that LCO foliar spray may trigger differential expression of stress-related genes in the absence of external stress, this study revealed that in the presence of external stress (low temperature), LCO foliar spray also caused differential expression of stress-related genes, possibly through re-programming of host stress response. In addition to the analysis carried out at 48 h after treatment, a temporal analysis of control and LCO-treated plants during the 48 h following foliar spray was performed, which had led to the identification of thousands of differentially expressed genes in both treatment-groups. Over half of temporally altered genes in the control and LCO-treated plants were overlapping. Both the overlapping and treatment-specific genes were functionally categorized. Similar to findings at the 48 h time point, stress-related genes occupied the second largest percentage (around 17&#x00025;), after unknown genes (around 30&#x00025;). These stress-related genes are known to be involved in defence, cold acclimation, hormonal response, transcription regulation, and secondary metabolism. Notably, cold acclimation-related genes were mostly down-regulated, along with components responsible for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; while genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids and lignin were mainly up-regulated. The data indicate that plants in both treatment-groups were subject to maturation and aging, while adapting to the low temperature stress conditions at the same time. The data also suggest that under sub-optimal temperature, soybean plants respond to LCO foliar spray by both re-programming existing signaling pathways and activating novel pathways.</p><p>To summarize, the genes differentially expressed as a result of LCO foliar spray under sub-optimal temperature, were those related to enhancement of various stress resistances, senescence and development-related genes, especially those involved in defence, cold, oxidative stress, and phosphate deficiency. It is also interesting that most plant hormone-related genes were down-regulated, together with the MAPK-related components. This suggests that LCO can be perceived by an unknown receptor(s) in non-symbiotic tissues under sub-optimal temperature, leading to the reprogramming of plant stress responses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Approach to the data</title><p>We exerted strict criteria at every stage, from data collection to statistical analysis.

Our results showed no obvious defect in the intensity maps of any of the 12 arrays we performed, indicating good physical conditions of all the arrays used in this study. The expression data was normalized using the RMA algorithm. The microarray experiment in this study was designed in a circular manner, comprising 4 gene lists generated by 4 contrasts of biologically relevant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031571-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the normalized arrays which simplify data sets by capturing the major sources of variance in the study, leading to reduced dimensions, indicating that the biological replicates were uniform in nature and responded similarly to the same treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>LCO purification via HPLC</title><p>

After RMA normalization, the median log-scale expression measure of each GeneChip&#x000ae; was zero, as the base 2 logarithm of RMA signals were median-centered. Three separate algorithms were used to calculate p-values: Cyber-T, Local Pooled Error (LPE) and Empirical Bayes (EB; Rocke). For each algorithm, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction procedure was used, with the Benjamini Hochberg algorithm. As a result, an adjusted p-value (<italic>q</italic>-value) was produced for each comparison. The corrected data was then filtered with two criteria: data points with <italic>q</italic>-values of &#x02264;0.05 were considered statistically significant, and genes expressed at fold-changes of &#x02265;1.6 or &#x02264;&#x02212;1.6 were considered biologically significant.
