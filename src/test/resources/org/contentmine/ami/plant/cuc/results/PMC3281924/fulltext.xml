Exhaustive transcriptome analysis of developing rice embryo and endosperm will help to characterize the genes possibly involved in the regulation of seed development and provide clues of yield and quality improvement.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Our analysis showed that genes involved in metabolism regulation, hormone response and cellular organization processes are predominantly expressed during rice development. Interestingly, 191 transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes are predominantly expressed in seed and 59 TFs are regulated during seed development, some of which are homologs of seed-specific TFs or regulators of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seed development. Gene co-expression network analysis showed these TFs associated with multiple cellular and metabolism pathways, indicating a complex regulation of rice seed development. Further, by employing a cold-resistant <italic>cultivar</italic> Hanfeng (HF), genome-wide analyses of seed transcriptome at normal and low temperature reveal that rice seed is sensitive to low temperature at early stage and many genes associated with seed development are down-regulated by low temperature, indicating that the delayed development of rice seed by low temperature is mainly caused by the inhibition of the development-related genes. The transcriptional response of seed and seedling to low temperature is different, and the differential expressions of genes in signaling and metabolism pathways may contribute to the chilling tolerance of HF during seed development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results provide informative clues and will significantly improve the understanding of rice seed development regulation and the mechanism of cold response in rice seed.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice seed (strictly caryopsis) is a highly specialized storage organ for nutrient materials including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Study of the regulatory networks of seed development is of significance for understanding the mechanisms controlling plant reproductive development and crop improvement.</p><p>The grass caryopsis is a single-seeded fruit composed of three genetically distinct tissue types: the filial embryo, the triploid endosperm, and the maternal pericarp and seed coat. A staging system of rice embryo development, containing 10 stages, had been proposed based on the landmark events during embryo development <xref rid="pone.0031081-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Embryonic shoot apical meristem (SAM) is formed during early embryogenesis and is the center of organogenesis during post-embryonic development <xref rid="pone.0031081-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. SAM differentiates after late globular stage (3 days after fertilization, DAF), and first leaf primordium emerges at 5&#x02013;6 DAF. After formation of the second and third leaf primordial at 7&#x02013;8 DAF, seed organs enlarge and morphogenesis completes at 9&#x02013;10 DAF, and embryo matures at 11&#x02013;20 DAF <xref rid="pone.0031081-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Genetic and molecular mechanisms governing embryonic SAM formation have been extensively investigated and several key genetic components have been characterized, including OSH1, a class I Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor that involves in embryonic SAM formation and maintenance <xref rid="pone.0031081-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The development of rice endosperm belongs to the <italic>ab initio</italic> nuclear type. At early days after fertilization, a large number of free endosperm nuclei locate in the peripheral region of embryo sac. Cell wall formation occurs centripetally at 3 DAF and then mitotic phase starts at 4 DAF <xref rid="pone.0031081-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Cellularization of endosperm is completed at approximately 6 DAF followed by endoreduplication at 8&#x02013;10 DAF <xref rid="pone.0031081-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Programmed cell death (PCD) in the endosperm begins at 16 DAF, and as a result, only the cells in aleurone layer are alive in the mature endosperm <xref rid="pone.0031081-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Many efforts have been made to characterize the regulatory mechanism of seed development. A large number of mutants with alteration in various aspects of rice seeds have been reported (reviewed by Kurata et al., <xref rid="pone.0031081-Kurata1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>) and many mutants with defective embryo development are caused by the mutation of genes regulating SAM formation. Mutations of rice <italic>SHOOTLESS2</italic> (<italic>SHL2</italic>), <italic>SHL4</italic>/<italic>SHOOT ORGANIZATION2</italic> (<italic>SHO2</italic>), and <italic>SHO1</italic> result in the defective expression of homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) family transcription factors (TFs), which play important roles in SAM initiation and maintenance during embryo development <xref rid="pone.0031081-Nagasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

However, most of the studies focused on various metabolic pathways such as nutrient partitioning. In rice, different technologies including EST <xref rid="pone.0031081-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031081-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, cDNA <xref rid="pone.0031081-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and DNA microarray <xref rid="pone.0031081-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031081-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031081-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and deep sequencing <xref rid="pone.0031081-Venu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> have been applied to analyze the transcriptional profiles in seeds. In most of these studies (except in 14), RNAs were collected from seed tissues at single time point of multiple genotypes/cultivars. For example, genes required for grain endosperm chalkiness determination are identified by comparing the seed transcriptomes of high chalkiness near-isogenic line and its normal parental line <xref rid="pone.0031081-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and genes related to grain quality are identified by comparing five rice cultivars through deep sequencing <xref rid="pone.0031081-Venu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition, characterization of the transcriptional dynamics during seed development provides informative clues of gene regulation and a <italic>cis</italic> element, AACA, is identified to be over-represented in genes up-regulated during grain filling (MYB TFs are possibly involved in the regulation of seed development through similar cis-elements <xref rid="pone.0031081-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>). Our previous studies by using cDNA microarray indicated that homeobox TFs are actively expressed in developing rice seed, suggesting the essential roles of them in regulation of seed development <xref rid="pone.0031081-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>As a species mostly planted in tropical and subtropical regions, rice is sensitive to chilling temperature (0&#x02013;15&#x000b0;C), especially at reproductive stage, which is a serious problem at high latitudes and in uplands at low latitudes. During bolting and flowering stages, low temperature causes a significant decline in spikelet fertility due to the failure of microspore development <xref rid="pone.0031081-Satake1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, the effect of low temperature on seed development has not been well characterized, although several TFs have been identified being crucial in cold response during vegetative stage <xref rid="pone.0031081-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. C-repeat (CRT)-binding factors (CBFs)/dehydration-responsive-element-binding proteins (DREBs), which belong to APETALA2 (AP2)/Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) family, are induced during cold acclimation and activate the transcription of cold-responsive genes, including COR (cold regulated), KIN (cold-induced), LTI (low-temperature induced) and RD (responsive to dehydration) genes, through binding to their promoters <xref rid="pone.0031081-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Some TFs, such as Inducer of CBF Expression1 (ICE1) and AtMYB15, regulate the expression of CBF/DREB genes <xref rid="pone.0031081-Agarwal2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, there are still few studies on the transcriptional regulation by low temperature in rice seeds.</p><p>To characterize the transcriptional networks controlling rice seed development, especially at low temperature, we analyzed the transcriptome of developing embryo and endosperm, and seeds under chilling temperature using Affymetrix rice genome array.

Expression data of these samples were compared to identify genes regulated by low temperature and genes involved in cold resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microarray hybridization and data normalization</title><p>GeneChip&#x000ae; rice genome array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used in DNA microarray analysis. Total RNAs from embryo and endosperm of seeds, leaf, root, seedling, ovary and developing seeds with and without low temperature treatment were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 10 &#x000b5;g cRNA was used for hybridization. Washing, staining, and scanning were performed as described in the supplier's protocol. The hybridization signals were normalized using GC-Robust Multichip Average (GC-RMA) from Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) Suite of tools for the statistical package R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">www.R-project.org</ext-link>). All the data can be accessed at GEO. The series GSE11966 includes data from rice seedling, leaf, root, embryo and endosperm at 6 DAF, GSE27856 includes data from rice ovary, embryo and endosperm of other developmental stages in ZH. The dataset from cold treatment experiments in ZH and HF seed is under GSE31077. Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) were carried out for each sample to check the replicate quality of microarray data.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Data Statistical Analysis</title><p>The linear statistical model in Limma package <xref rid="pone.0031081-Wettenhall1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> from Bioconductor was used to identify significant differentially expressed genes between two groups. ANOVA tool in TIGR MeV (version 4.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org/mev.html">http://www.tm4.org/mev.html</ext-link>) was used to identify genes differentially expressed in embryo and endosperm in time course. False discovery rates (FDRs) for various P value thresholds were later determined by described method <xref rid="pone.0031081-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. To identify genes predominantly expressed in embryo and endosperm, the threshold was set as FDR adjusted P value&#x0003c;0.0005 and change ratio &#x0003e;2.0. For time course genes, the threshold was P value&#x0003c;0.001. For low temperature regulated genes, the threshold was set as P value&#x0003c;0.05 and change ratio &#x0003e;2.0. The raw data of cold response transcriptome of rice seedling was downloaded from GEO at NCBI (GSE6901), which included materials treated by low temperature (4&#x000b0;C). The analysis pipelines were same as performed in rice seed.</p><p>A recently published microarray dataset (GSE21494 in GEO, <xref rid="pone.0031081-Sato2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) of Agilent platform (GPL6864) was compared with data of this study to validate the gene expression patterns. Firstly, the probes with low expression levels (&#x0003c;0) were filtered out and expression data of ten embryo and endosperm samples were then summarized by gene models in TIGR rice genome annotation (V6.1). The expression trends of genes regulated during embryo or endosperm developments were compared.</p><p>To annotate the functions of identified gene sets, the gene ontology information from gene ontology website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link>), Rice Genome Annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/</ext-link>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Ontologies/Gene_Ontology/">ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Ontologies/Gene_Ontology/</ext-link>) were used.

For each sample, cDNA was synthesized from 1 &#x000b5;g of total RNA using PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa DRR047A). qRT-PCR analysis was performed on Rotor-Gene RG-3000A (Corbett) using SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO QPK-201), with three biological replicates of each tissue.

The ratio of each cis-element in a particular group was compared with that in the whole genome followed by performing Chi-square test. Because &#x0223c;200 known cis-elements were analyzed for each group, FDRs for various P value thresholds were determined.

The probe sets on the array with very low intensity through all the hybridizations were excluded (determined using MAS5 method). The Pearson correlation coefficients between probes representing each TF gene and other genes on the array were calculated. The GO terms were used to annotate the top 500 related genes of each TF gene.
