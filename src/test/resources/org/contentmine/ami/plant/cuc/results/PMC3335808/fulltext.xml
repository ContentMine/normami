This capacity is associated with both cell cycle reactivation and acquisition of specific cellular characters. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming of protoplasts into stem cells remain largely unknown. Protoplasts of the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> easily regenerate into protonema and therefore provide an ideal system to explore how differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to produce stem cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal findings</title><p>We obtained genome-wide digital gene expression tag profiles within the first three days of <italic>P. patens</italic> protoplast reprogramming. At four time-points during protoplast reprogramming, the transcript levels of 4827 genes changed more than four-fold and their expression correlated with the reprogramming phase. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified a set of significantly enriched GO terms and pathways, most of which were associated with photosynthesis, protein synthesis and stress responses. DEGs were grouped into six clusters that showed specific expression patterns using a K-means clustering algorithm. An investigation of function and expression patterns of genes identified a number of key candidate genes and pathways in early stages of protoplast reprogramming, which provided important clues to reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for protoplast reprogramming.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified genes that show highly dynamic changes in expression during protoplast reprogramming into stem cells in <italic>P. patens</italic>. These genes are potential targets for further functional characterization and should be valuable for exploration of the mechanisms of stem cell reprogramming. In particular, our data provides evidence that protoplasts of <italic>P. patens</italic> are an ideal model system for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiated plant cell reprogramming.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell reprogramming is an important biological phenomenon whereby cells regress from a specialized, differentiated state to a simple, undifferentiated cell type reminiscent of stem cells with the capability for both self-renewal and to give rise to most other cell types in multicellular organisms <xref rid="pone.0035961-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Slack1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Asymmetric division of a stem cell generates two different daughter cells: a self-renewed stem cell daughter that retains the stem cell's pluripotent characteristics, and a differentiated non-stem cell daughter <xref rid="pone.0035961-McKay1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Stem cells in plant shoot and root meristems are maintained throughout the life of plants and produce somatic daughter cells that make up the body of plants <xref rid="pone.0035961-Byrne1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Commonly, specialized cells are formed by a one-way process as a fertilized egg develops into an adult, and the cells become increasingly, and normally irreversibly, committed to their fate. However, certain experimental procedures can reverse the cell differentiation process and cause cells to acquire a new fate by reprogramming, a term that describes a switch in nuclear gene expression in one kind of cell to induce it to differentiate into a different cell type. A distinctive feature of cell reprogramming is the withdrawal from a given differentiated state into a stem cell-like state that confers pluripotentiality, a process that precedes the switch in cell fate <xref rid="pone.0035961-Grafi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This process underlies the totipotency, regeneration and formation of new stem cells. Elucidation of how cell reprogramming takes place is important to help us understand the mechanisms by which cell division and differentiation occur.</p><p>Reprogramming of a differentiated cell to become a pluripotent stem cell is frequently observed in plants and is more easily induced in plants than in animals. Differentiated plant cells, in contrast to those of animals, hold multiple developmental potentialities during development and retain a plasticity that enables dedifferentiation <xref rid="pone.0035961-Ondej1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the genetic and molecular bases of this difference between plant and animal cells are mostly unknown.</p><p>Recently, artificial expression of two transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, together with other factors made it possible to reprogram differentiated somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells in mice and humans <xref rid="pone.0035961-Masip1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The study of cellular reprogramming in animals is limited because of the lack of a suitable, convenient experimental system <xref rid="pone.0035961-Takebe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Plant protoplasts (plant cells devoid of cell walls) provide an outstanding experimental tool for the study of the biochemical and molecular basis of cellular reprogramming into stem cells <xref rid="pone.0035961-Ondej1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Tessadori1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Application of phytohormones, such as auxins and cytokinins, stimulate protoplasts from different tissues to reenter the cell cycle, proliferate, and undergo regenerative processes to give rise to new plantlets <xref rid="pone.0035961-Cocking1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0035961-Takebe2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Using a plant protoplast system, Zhao et al. <xref rid="pone.0035961-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> demonstrated that protoplasts can be isolated easily from fully differentiated, non-dividing mesophyll cells of tobacco leaves, and reenter the cell cycle and proliferate following treatment with auxin and cytokinin. These authors also found that the reprogramming of tobacco mesophyll cells proceeds by two functionally distinct phases of chromatin decondensation: the first is a transitory phase that confers competence for a switch in cell fate followed, under appropriate hormonal conditions, by a second phase that represents commitment to the mitotic cycle. Subsequent studies of protoplast reprogramming concentrated on the relationship between transcription and the structure of chromatin that is involved in heterochromatin decondensation and histone modification <xref rid="pone.0035961-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Tessadori1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-vanDriel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Tessadori2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Compared to vascular plants, bryophytes and ferns have a single stem cell in the protonema tip and leafy shoot apex, lack a stem cell niche and organization center, and possess an accessible haploid and relatively simple structure <xref rid="pone.0035961-Deveaux1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and thus represent a simpler experimental system. Although they diverged hundreds of millions of years ago, bryophytes share similar fundamental genetic and physiological features with seed plants <xref rid="pone.0035961-Rensing1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and are phylogenetically intermediate between algae and seed plants <xref rid="pone.0035961-Reski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Among bryophytes, the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> has emerged recently as the bryophyte model of choice for studies of development, genetics and stress responses <xref rid="pone.0035961-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0035961-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>P. patens</italic> apical stem cell system has received much attention following its description in 2007 ().

A recent study on reprogramming of excised leaf cells indicated that a cell cycle protein kinase A (CDKA) regulates cell division and acquisition of new cell characteristics in the reprogramming of differentiated cells to become stem cells in plants <xref rid="pone.0035961-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

The objectives of the present study were to: (1) characterize changes in gene expression associated with protoplast reprogramming, (2) investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for protoplast reprogramming, and (3) identify candidate genes and key factors involved in protoplast reprogramming into stem cells. By combining the <italic>P. patens</italic> protoplast system with a digital gene expression tag profiling (DGEP) strategy, we obtained spatiotemporal-specific gene regulation models for protoplast reprogramming.

The DEGs were significantly enriched in the processes of a variety of biotic and abiotic responses (including responses to salt stress, cold, cadmium ions and bacterial infection), photosynthesis-related processes, glycolysis, ribosome biosynthesis and translation. However, the number, expression level and description of DEGs differed at different stages during protoplast reprogramming. These results indicated that these biological processes played important roles in protoplast reprogramming. The expression changes of DEGs involved in photosystem II repair and responses to blue light, high light intensity and heat occurred within the first 24 h of protoplast reprogramming. In addition, alteration in expression of DEGs involved in thylakoid membrane organization, protein importation into chloroplast stroma, photorespiration, chloroplast organization, and response to abscisic acid (ABA) might also be necessary for stem cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Similarly, a requirement for stem-cell division and differentiation was reflected in expression of DEGs involved in purine nucleotide biosynthesis, embryo development, fatty acid biosynthesis, protein folding, photoinhibition and response to wounding. Significantly enriched molecular functions of DEGs were 3-chloroallylaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, poly (U) RNA binding, chlorophyll binding, structural constituent of ribosome, copper ion binding and catalytic activity. Some DEGs that functioned in glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, <italic>p</italic>-<italic>p</italic>-bond-hydrolysis-driven protein factor activity, translation initiation factor activity binding and rRNA binding were significantly enriched from 24 and 72 h.

Furthermore, DEGs that functioned in phosphoglycerate kinase activity, aminomethyltransferase activity, acetyl-coA carboxylase activity, glutamate-ammonia ligase activity, oxidoreductase activity that acted on paired donors, glutathione binding, ATPase activity coupled to transmembrane movement of substances and calmodulin binding (from 0 to 24 h), alpha-amylase activity, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity and GTP binding (from 24 to 48 h), and phosphoglucomutase activity, ubiquitin binding, protein histidine kinase activity and cobalt ion binding (from 48 to 72 h), might also be vital for the transition from protoplasts to stem cells and stem-cell division and differentiation.</p><p>The cellular components of DEGs were mainly enriched in the chloroplast stroma, chloroplast thylakoid, and chloroplast envelope, followed by the vacuolar membrane, ribosome, stromule and apoplast, which indicated that the molecular biological reactions mainly occurred in the chloroplast, vacuolar membrane, ribosome, stromule and apoplast.

Some genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and selenoamino acid metabolism pathways were specifically enriched within the first 24 h of protoplast reprogramming, early stage of stem cell reprogramming. Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, lysine degradation, fatty acid metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and pentose phosphate pathways and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were specifically enriched from 24 to 48 h, a stage of stem cell re-entering cell cycle.

<italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> is an excellent system for exploration of the mechanisms of protoplast reprogramming into stem cells</title><p>At recent annual moss meetings (2007) and the 21<sup>st</sup> International Conference on Arabidopsis Research in 2010, the <italic>P. patens</italic> apical stem cell system received considerable attention. In addition to the advantages of the system already outlined, cell divisions can be followed easily in time and space because nearly all gametophytic cells are in direct contact with the environment (i.e., there are no &#x02018;hidden&#x02019; cell layers). In addition, the control of cell fate over time and space can be studied both in the protonemal cell lineage and in the more complex tissue of the gametophore. Orthologues for many genes are present in angiosperms and close paralogs are present in gymnosperms. The genome of <italic>P. patens</italic> encodes homologues of stem cell-related genes, such as three WOX paralogs and NAC transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0035961-Deveaux1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Richardt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, how these genes function during development or protoplast regeneration is still unclear. The morphological and structural characteristics allow us to track the mechanisms both at the single-cell level and in living plants. Compared to other protoplast systems, <italic>P. patens</italic> protoplasts are readily isolated from young protonemal tissue <xref rid="pone.0035961-Slack1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A major advantage of the <italic>P. patens</italic> system is the ease with which cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells. Another advantage of the <italic>P. patens</italic> &#x02018;protoplast&#x02013;stem cell system&#x02019; is that protoplast regeneration occurs at a high frequency, does not require supplementation of the medium with hormones, and results directly in the formation of chloronemal filaments or even a whole gametophyte and does not undergo a callus stage <xref rid="pone.0035961-Cove1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In these respects the process thus resembles spore germination <xref rid="pone.0035961-Cove1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

The communication between cells is interrupted. In order to survive, protoplasts must first cope with the alteration of the surrounding environment and renew the cell configuration. We propose that a cascade of stress signal reactions is generated when a protoplast is completely separated from a cell wall. Such reactions might be similar to those accompanied by plasmolysis of plant cells caused by drought or salt. Changes in the expression levels of stress-response genes in the protoplasts might be partially associated with the process of protoplast separation <italic>per se</italic>. This process is likely to be stressful for a protonemal cell because the cell wall is enzymatically degraded and the protoplast is separated from its mechanically rigid, protective polysaccharide envelope into a hypertonic solution. The process of protoplast separation from a cell wall is a type of cell wounding. To survive, the protoplast must initiate the repair mechanism to confront the damage induced by cell wall removal, which represent alteration of metabolism of other materials and energy supply. Our results show that the significantly enriched pathways, which were concentrated in decreased photosynthesis, increased fatty acid, O-glycan, flavonoid, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, and propanoate metabolism, contribute to the survival and rejuvenation of the protoplast.</p><p>Results from morphogenetic observation and FCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035961-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) show that after culture for 48 h most protoplast-derived cells have been successfully reprogrammed into stem cells and re-enter the cell cycle.

In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in pollen mother cells.</p><p>In Arabidopsis, stem cell identity maintenance is dependent on the WUS-CLV feedback regulation loop in the shoot apical meristem or on WOX5-SCR/SHR feedback regulation in root apical meristems, which are both dependent on stem niche <xref rid="pone.0035961-Sablowski1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. <italic>P. patens</italic> lacks a stem cell niche and only one apical stem cell is present in the protonema tip and leafy shoot apex <xref rid="pone.0035961-Deveaux1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the present study, the higher expression levels of homologues of <italic>WOX13</italic> and <italic>BAM2</italic> indicate that the two genes may play pivotal roles in protoplast transformation into stem cells. We further hypothesize that protoplast reprogramming into stem cells and maintenance of the single stem cell identity may be partially determined by interaction of WOX and BAM proteins. However, further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>2. Epigenetic/methylation modification of protein during stem cell reprogramming</title><p>Genetic evidence indicates that, similar to animals, stem cells in plants possess a specialized chromatin structure. This may reflect their capacity for a variety of gene-expression programs, as well as their ability to divide repeatedly without either differentiation or senescence. In recent years, epigenetic mechanisms that control chromatin structure and function, including DNA methylation and histone modification, have emerged as key factors in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and, thereby, the nuclear reprogramming necessary for dedifferentiation <xref rid="pone.0035961-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Protein methylation is one type of protein post-translational modification and has been most studied for histones, which can act epigenetically to repress or activate gene expression <xref rid="pone.0035961-Grewal1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035961-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.</p><p>Several genes that encode homologues of methyltransferase in Arabidopsis, including Pp1s233_104V6 (protein arginine methyltransferase 4B, PRMT4B), Pp1s271_68V6 (cobalamin-independent synthase family protein, ATMS1), Pp1s31_85V6 (protein-l-isoaspartate methyltransferase 1, PIMT1), Pp1s35_262V6 (protein-l-isoaspartate methyltransferase 2, PIMT2) and Pp1s8_46V6 (homocysteine methyltransferase 2, HMT2), are preferentially expressed within 24 h of protoplast isolation, a stage of stem cell reformation. These results indicate that protein methylation may be an additional important epigenetic mechanism for establishment and/or maintenance of the undifferentiated state during protoplast reprogramming into stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>3. Endogenous phytohormones and phytohormone-responsive genes</title><p>How the regulators described above actually control the behavior of protoplast reprogramming into stem cells in <italic>P. patens</italic> is still largely unknown. Phytohormones are the most likely candidates as regulators of developmental switches, and it has been proposed that hormones play a central role in mediating the signal transduction cascade that leads to the reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that the requirement for a wide variety of endogenous phytohormones during protoplast reprogramming into stem cells is largely determined by the stage of the cultures.</p><p>Cytokinins have many roles in plant development, one of which is to stimulate cell division in the shoot in vascular plants <xref rid="pone.0035961-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Cytokinins induce bud formation in mosses in a concentration-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0035961-Decker1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Cytokinin biosynthesis and signal transduction might be necessary for the activation of protoplast reprogramming processes, but not for subsequent stem cell reprogramming processes. For example, isopentenyl transferase 9 (IPT9), which catalyzes the first step in isopentenyl-type cytokinin (a major cytokinin in moss) <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0035961-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, shows maximal expression in freshly isolated protoplasts.</p><p>Moreover, several ethylene-response genes show preferential expression during both stages of initiation of reprogramming and chloronemal cell division and differentiation after stem cell formation. However, some genes related to the synthesis and signaling of auxin, ABA and jasmonic acid are also altered the transcriptional levels throughout the reprogramming process after removal of the cell wall. Thus, we speculate that a dynamic balance in the interactions among phytohormones, especially of auxin, ABA and jasmonic acid may be pivotal in distinct stages of protoplast reprogramming and switching cell fate during protoplast reprogramming into stem cells, through coordinated interactions with many metabolic pathways (for example, photosynthesis, cell respiration, and protein synthesis and degradation). Nevertheless, further experiments are necessary to verify this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome during <italic>P. patens</italic> protoplast reprogramming into stem cells. The transcript levels of 4827 genes were significantly increased or reduced, of which the majority changed only during a specific stage. Our results provide an extensive catalogue of regulatory factors and related genes involved in protoplast survival, reprogramming, and cell division during protoplast reprogramming into stem cells in <italic>P. patens</italic>. Potential applications of these data include identification of candidate genes and as targets for reverse genetic studies of stem cell maintenance and its evolution, and as tools for exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell reprogramming in plants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Preparation of protoplasts and culture conditions</title><p>Protonemal tissue of the Gransden 2004 wild-type strain of <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> subsp. <italic>patens</italic> was subcultured at weekly intervals on solid BCDAG medium overlaid on cellophane and containing 5 mM ammonium tartrate <xref rid="pone.0035961-Ashton1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.
