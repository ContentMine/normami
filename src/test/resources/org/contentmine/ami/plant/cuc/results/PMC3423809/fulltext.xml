In the angiosperm model plant, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the establishment of cotyledonary boundaries and the embryonal SAM is dependent on PAT and the expression of the <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</italic> (<italic>CUC</italic>) genes, which belong to the large <italic>NAC</italic> gene family.

Meristem formation has been extensively studied in the model angiosperm <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, but to a much lesser extent in gymnosperms. Angiosperms and gymnosperms separated approx. 300 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C46">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and, apart from the distinctive feature of having enclosed or open (naked) seeds, there are many developmental differences between the two groups. For example, during embryogenesis of most conifers, the cotyledons develop as a crown surrounding the incipient shoot apical meristem (SAM). This contrasts with the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> embryo, in which a symmetry-breaking event (from radial to bilateral symmetry) is associated with the emergence of the SAM and the two opposing cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C14">Chandler, 2008</xref>). Pattern formation in conifer embryos has been difficult to study as many conifers set cones irregularly, and the embryo development within one cone is highly unsynchronized. However, we have established a protocol for somatic embryogenesis in <italic>Picea abies</italic>, which allows us to regenerate a large number of somatic embryos at specific developmental stages at specific time points. This protocol has proven to be most valuable for studying pattern formation in conifer embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C4">von Arnold and Clapham, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The NAC family constitutes one of the largest plant-specific families of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C40">Riechmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Members of this family have a DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region known as the NAC domain, an acronym derived from the first characterized <italic>NAC</italic> genes, <italic>NO APICAL MERISTEM</italic> (<italic>NAM</italic>) in <italic>Petunia</italic>, and <italic>ATAF1</italic>, <italic>ATAF2</italic> and <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2</italic> (<italic>CUC2</italic>) in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The function and the expression pattern of reported <italic>NAC</italic> genes are highly diverse, and include roles in SAM formation and organ separation, cell division, hormone signalling, senescence, growth of floral organs, lateral root formation, stress responses and wood formation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C36">Olsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C44">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Despite the importance of NAC proteins in fundamental processes, to our knowledge, nothing is presently known about the role of <italic>NAC</italic> genes in conifers.</p><p>The first <italic>NAC</italic> gene to be characterized was <italic>NAM</italic>, which was discovered in a seedling-lethal mutant with no SAM in <italic>Petunia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C47">Souer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). A similar phenotype was later discovered in <italic>cuc1cuc2</italic> double mutants of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). To date, three <italic>CUC</italic> genes (<italic>CUC1</italic>, <italic>CUC2</italic> and <italic>CUC3</italic>) have been characterized in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C49">Takada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C54">Vroemen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). They act together with the <italic>KNOTTED1-like homeobox</italic> (<italic>KNOXI</italic>) gene <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (<italic>STM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C8">Barton and Poethig, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C2">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) to establish the embryonal SAM and to promote formation of two separated cotyledons. The <italic>CUC</italic> genes are expressed in the intercotyledonary regions, where the gene activity presumably prevents cell proliferation and cotyledon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C13">Breuil-Broyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The restriction of <italic>CUC</italic> gene expression is regulated by <italic>PINFORMED1</italic> (<italic>PIN1</italic>), <italic>PINOID</italic> (<italic>PID</italic>) and <italic>MONOPTEROS</italic> (<italic>MP</italic>), which are genes involved in auxin transport and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C3">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C19">Furutani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). PIN-mediated polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for pattern formation, and studies of auxin-responsive gene expression have revealed that cotyledon outgrowth occurs at positions of PAT-mediated auxin response maxima (Benkova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003). Furthermore, blocked PAT leads to the development of seedlings with fused cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C35">Okada <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C29">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C20">Hadfi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In addition to being regulated by PAT, the abundance of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by the microRNA miR164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C28">Laufs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C31">Mallory <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that PAT is crucial for correct pattern formation in somatic embryos of <italic>P. abies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C26">Larsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Blocked PAT resulted in increased endogenous indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) levels, abnormal cell divisions, decreased programmed cell death, fused cotyledons and aborted SAM. Furthermore, we recently showed that the expression of two <italic>KNOXI</italic> genes (<italic>HBK2</italic> and <italic>HBK4</italic>) was affected by blocked PAT during embryo development in <italic>P. abies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C27">Larsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). As a first step to characterize the <italic>NAC</italic> gene family in conifers, and specifically the role of <italic>CUC</italic> genes during embryogenesis, we have here identified 16 <italic>P. glauca NAC</italic> genes in GenBank and allocated them to different clades within the <italic>NAC</italic> gene family. Furthermore, two <italic>P. abies NAC</italic> genes, <italic>PaNAC01</italic> and <italic>PaNAC02</italic>, highly similar to the <italic>A. thaliana CUC</italic> genes, were characterized. The expression profile of <italic>PaNAC01</italic> showed that the gene is regulated by PAT, and associated with SAM differentiation and cotyledon formation. Together the results show that <italic>CUC-</italic>like genes existed before the separation between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and suggest a conserved function between PaNAC01 and CUC1/CUC2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>NAC domains from <italic>Picea glauca</italic> were retrieved by a tblastn search in the nucleotide collection at NCBI (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast</uri>; 30 May 2011), using the NAC domains of representative <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> proteins as query (i.e. CUC2, NAC1, ATAF1, RD26 and TIP1). The obtained sequences were further analysed to ensure that only sequences representing full-length NAC domains were included.

A heuristic search of replicates with 1000 random stepwise taxon additions was performed. All equally parsimonious trees were retained for analysis, and the Tree Bisection&#x02013;Reconnection (TBR) algorithm was used for branch swapping. Gaps were treated as missing data. Bootstrap support for nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C17">Felsenstein, 1985</xref>) were estimated with 1000 heuristic search replicates using the same settings as the original search, with 100 random stepwise additions for each bootstrap replicate. Bayesian analysis was performed using Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo methods as implemented in MrBayes V. 3&#x000b7;1&#x000b7;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C22">Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C41">Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003</xref>). The chain was run for 20 million generations without enforcing a molecular clock with a random starting tree. The chain was sampled every 5000 generations for a total of 8002 trees, and used to calculate posterior probabilities for clades (clade credibility values; CVs). The first 1000 trees were discarded as &#x02018;burn-in&#x02019; (trees generated before likelihood values reached stationary). The General Time Reversible model with gamma distributed rates across sites was used, and the number of discrete categories was set to 4.

In addition to three previously described L, V and W motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C49">Takada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C50">Taoka <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), one new motif was found to be conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F2">2</xref>A). This motif was named the K-motif, since two lysines (K) were found in the beginning of the motif in all but one sequence. Based on the composition of the motifs, the analysed sequences were divided into four groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F2">2</xref>A). The sequences in group I harboured all four motifs. These were CUC2, NAM and most of their orthologues in other dicots, but also ANAC100 and ANAC79/80, which have not yet been characterized. The sequences in group II lacked the K-motif. Some of these sequences, such as CUC1 and the monocot sequences ZmNAM1 and ZmNAM2, as well as the <italic>P. abies</italic> sequence PaNAC01 were highly similar to the sequences in group I. In addition, NAC1, which is involved in auxin signalling and lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C57">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), ORE, which regulates age-dependent programmed cell death in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C24">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), as well as not yet characterized <italic>A. thaliana</italic> proteins such as ANAC059, and AT3G12977 joined this group. All 21 sequences in groups I and II, including PaNAC01, harboured the V-motif, which has also been assigned as a microRNA (miR164) recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C39">Rhoades <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Six of these 21 genes have been shown to be post-transcriptionally regulated by miR164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C45">Sieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and, based on sequence similarity, it seems likely that other members of groups I and II are also recognized by miR164 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F2">2</xref>B). PaNAC02 formed group III together with seven sequences from <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and StCUC3. All these sequences harboured the K-motif but lacked the V-motif and at least one of the other two motifs. Group IV consisted of sequences lacking both the K-motif and the V-motif. Here, most CUC3 sequences clustered together with four uncharacterized proteins from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The phylogenetic analysis together with the motif analysis demonstrate that sequence elements of functional importance in CUC1 and CUC2 from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are conserved in PaNAC01, and that corresponding sequence elements have diverged or are lost in PaNAC02. This suggests that PaNAC01 might have a function similar to that of CUC1 and CUC2, while the function of PaNAC02 might be more diverse.

To test the relevance of this motif for gene expression, the complete 21 bp motif was deleted from the <italic>CUC2</italic> promoter, which was subsequently fused to the GUS reporter, and introduced into <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. In transformed seedlings harbouring the intact promoter&#x02013;GUS construct, GUS expression was detected in the boundaries between the cotyledons, the first true leaves, and the SAM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F4">4</xref>A). In contrast, the GUS expression became extended into the leaves and petioles in transformed seedlings harbouring a promoter&#x02013;GUS construct with the 21 bp motif deleted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F4">4</xref>B).

Both control somatic embryos and somatic embryos treated with NPA were divided into eight consecutive developmental stages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>). Stage 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>A) represented proliferating PEMs, and stage 8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>H) represented fully mature cotyledonary embryos. Early embryos started to differentiate at stage 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>B), and developed further at stages 3 and 4 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>C, D). At stage 5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>E), the SAM primordium became visible, and cotyledon primordia could be seen as small protuberances encircling the SAM. During stages 6&#x02013;8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>F&#x02013;H), the embryos continued to increase in size, the cotyledons expanded further, and finally fully spread out at stage 8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>H). When the developing embryos were treated with NPA, the development was disturbed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C26">Larsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C27">2012</xref>). Briefly, NPA-treated embryos developed more slowly. However, no distinct morphological differences between control embryos and NPA-treated embryos could be seen before the cotyledon primordia were clearly visible at stage 5 (cf. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>E, I). The small cotyledon protuberances that could be seen in control embryos were instead represented by a ring-shaped structure in NPA-treated embryos. As the embryos matured it became evident that the cotyledons were fused, giving the apex a doughnut appearance when observed from above. At stage 8, when the cotyledons of control embryos burst, the doughnut thinned out at the edges and there was a deep cavity in the centre (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>L).

In contrast to the self-fertilized M<sub>2</sub> progeny of host plants, these T<sub>2</sub> seedlings were all viable and did not display a cup-shaped cotyledon phenotype (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS151TB1">1</xref>). Rather, seedlings with either a partially fused cotyledon or a wild-type phenotype were predominant. No wild-type plants transformed with the construct showed a partially fused cotyledon phenotype (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS151TB1">1</xref>), excluding the possibility that the increase in this category among the complemented host lines was an artefact from the transformation process. The frequency of T<sub>2</sub> seedlings with a wild-type phenotype ranged between 28 % (line 386) and 91 % (line 396) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS151TB1">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F7">7</xref>D).

To avoid misleading interpretations, we suggest that all new NAC domain-encoding genes should be annotated as <italic>nnNACxx</italic>, where <italic>nn</italic> is the species initials and <italic>xx</italic> is a number, until further functional characterization has been made. Thus, all <italic>P. glauca</italic> and <italic>P. abies</italic> sequences in the present study were annotated accordingly.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis of NAC domain-encoding genes encompassing sequences from angiosperms, lycophytes and bryophytes has been carried out before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C44">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Here, we extended the analysis also to include sequences from a gymnosperm. The <italic>P. glauca</italic> sequences used in this study were retrieved from GenBank (30 May 2011) by searching with different <italic>NAC</italic> genes from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> representing the sequence variation in the entire <italic>NAC</italic> gene family. The same set of 16 mRNA clones was obtained repeatedly, independently of the query sequence used, which indicates that these 16 sequences constitute all <italic>NAC</italic> genes in <italic>P. glauca</italic> presently available in the databases. The established genome sequences from the green algae <italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic> and <italic>O. tauri</italic> were also analysed for the presence of <italic>NAC</italic> genes, although no such genes were found. It is therefore likely that the ancestral <italic>NAC</italic> gene or genes arose at the time of land plant colonization of Earth, dated to approx. 480 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C46">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, it cannot be excluded that an ancestral <italic>NAC</italic> gene has evolved, and today shows such a sequence divergence that it cannot be recognized as a <italic>NAC</italic> gene with the search settings used in this study.</p><p>All <italic>NAC</italic> sequences from <italic>P. glauca</italic> could be deployed to different clades (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F1">1</xref>), previously characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C44">Shen <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>. However, clades f and g did not harbour any <italic>P. glauca</italic> genes and there was no support for clade h. Since one <italic>P. patens</italic> sequence clustered with clade g, we assume that there exists at least one, as yet unidentified, <italic>P. glauca</italic> gene in this clade. On the other hand, the lack of both <italic>P. glauca</italic> and <italic>P. patens</italic> sequences in clades f and h suggests that these clades might be more recent than the other six clades.</p><p>It has been shown that NAC-encoding genes that are evolutionarily closely related often exert similar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C44">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C23">Jensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In clade c, <italic>PgNAC14</italic> is an orthologue to <italic>VND5</italic>, which is one of seven <italic>VND</italic> genes believed to be important for xylem vessel element formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C25">Kubo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition, <italic>PgNAC15</italic> clusters with clade c, which also harbours <italic>NST2</italic>, a gene involved in secondary wall thickening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C32">Mitsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>PgNAC14</italic> and <italic>PgNAC15</italic> are interesting candidates for studying wood formation in economically important conifers. The phylogenetic analysis also indicated that <italic>PgNAC07</italic> might have similar functions to the drought-inducible <italic>ATAF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C30">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which could also be of interest for future studies. <italic>PgNAC01</italic> and <italic>PgNAC02</italic> cluster with the <italic>CUC</italic> genes. Hence, provided that the phylogenetic relationship is indicative of functional similarity, <italic>PgNAC01</italic> and <italic>PgNAC02</italic> are likely to be involved in the establishment of cotyledonary boundaries and embryonal SAM.</p><p>The two cDNA sequences isolated from <italic>P. abies</italic> somatic embryos showed high similarity to <italic>PgNAC01</italic> and <italic>PgNAC02</italic>. PaNAC01 has conserved motifs that suggests a function similar to that of CUC1 and CUC2, while PaNAC02 is more reminiscent of other NAC sequences within the clade. An important difference between PaNAC01 and PaNAC02 is the presence of the W-motif in PaNAC01, but its absence in PaNAC02 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F2">2</xref>A). Similarly, CUC1 and CUC2, but not CUC3, carry the W-motif. This motif seems to be important for the function of at least the CUC1 protein, since a deletion of five amino acids around this motif in combination with the <italic>cuc2</italic> mutation results in cup-shaped cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C49">Takada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The new K-motif presented in this study is spread among the genes of the <italic>CUC</italic> clade. It is specific for the CUC2 orthologues, while it has been lost in the CUC1 lineage. Interestingly, the presence of the conserved 21 bp promoter motif in <italic>PaNAC01</italic>, <italic>PaNAC02</italic> and in all three <italic>A. thaliana CUC</italic> genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F3">3</xref>) suggests a common regulation for all five genes. The increased GUS expression in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants transformed with a promoter&#x02013;GUS fusion where the 21 bp motif has been deleted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F4">4</xref>) indicates that the motif mediates a negative regulation.</p><p><italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> but not <italic>CUC3</italic> are post-transcriptionally downregulated by miR164 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C28">Laufs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C31">Mallory <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>PaNAC01</italic> harbours the miR164 recognition site, and miR164 has been identified in a microRNA screen of <italic>P. abies</italic> (U. Lagercrantz, pers. commun.). However, it remains to be investigated whether this microRNA cleaves the <italic>PaNAC01</italic> mRNA. The miR164 recognition site could not be found in any NAC gene in <italic>P. patens</italic> or <italic>Selaginella moellendorffi</italic>, and large-scale sequencing of small RNAs has not identified miR164 in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C5">Axtell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This indicates that miR164-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of the <italic>CUC</italic> genes was established after the origin of seed plants but before the separation between angiosperms and gymnosperms.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Expression of <italic>PaNAC01</italic> coincides with the differentiation of the shoot apical meristem and formation of separated cotyledons</title><p>We have previously shown that PAT is crucial for the correct patterning of <italic>P. abies</italic> somatic embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C26">Larsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Mature embryos that have been treated with the PAT inhibitor NPA develop an abnormal apical part with fused cotyledons and aborted SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C26">Larsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C27">2012</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F5">5</xref>). The aberrant morphologies of NPA-treated <italic>P. abies</italic> embryos are comparable with several auxin response and transport mutants in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> such as <italic>mp</italic> and <italic>pin1</italic>, which also show abnormal expression patterns of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C3">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The relative expression of <italic>PaNAC01</italic> increases as early embryos differentiate, and remains at a steady level until the separated cotyledons are clearly visible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS151F6">6</xref>A). However, the upregulation of <italic>PaNAC01</italic> is reduced in embryos that form fused cotyledons and lack a functional SAM after being treated with NPA. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the expression of <italic>CUC2</italic> is reduced, while <italic>CUC1</italic> has a higher and broader expression when PAT is hampered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C3">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). With regards to this, the auxin-induced regulation of <italic>PaNAC01</italic> seems to be most similar to the regulation of <italic>CUC2</italic>. In accordance with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C53">Vialette-Guiraud <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> suggested that the <italic>CUC1</italic> lineage within the Brassicales has evolved more rapidly through positive selection than the <italic>CUC2</italic> lineage. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the cotyledons initiate at sites of auxin response maxima, presumably generated by the localization of PIN1 in the epidermal cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C10">Benkov&#x000e1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The <italic>CUC</italic> genes are first expressed in a region across the apical part of the early globular embryo, but as the embryo attains a bilateral symmetry, their expression is restricted to the marginal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C12">Bowman and Floyd, 2008</xref>). Although we have not been able to localize where <italic>PaNAC01</italic> is expressed, our results show that the temporal expression coincides with the differentiation of separated cotyledons and formation of the SAM.</p><p>The relative expression of <italic>PaNAC02</italic> is high in PEMs and early differentiating embryos but decreases as the embryos develop and mature. Interestingly, the downregulation occurs at about the same time as the cotyledons are delineated. However, the lack of previously described motifs and the similarity to as yet uncharacterized genes make it difficult to assign a function to PaNAC02. The expression of <italic>PaNAC02</italic> is not dependent on PAT. However, this does not rule out that PaNAC02 can act redundantly with PaNAC01, just like CUC3 acts redundantly with CUC1 and CUC2, despite its lack of functional motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C54">Vroemen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>PaNAC01 can induce cotyledon separation</title><p>Similar to what has been shown for CUC1 and CUC2, PaNAC01 harbours all motifs that have been proven to be functionally important, and its expression is dependent on PAT. Hence, it was interesting to investigate if PaNAC01 functionally could complement the <italic>A. thaliana cuc1cuc2</italic> double mutant. Indeed, it was possible to restore the wild-type phenotype of these plants by expressing <italic>PaNAC01</italic> from the <italic>A. thaliana CUC2</italic> promoter. A fraction of the mutant seedlings expressing <italic>PaNAC01</italic> showed a heart-shaped phenotype. This phenotype has been considered as a weaker phenotype of <italic>cuc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), and is particularly abundant in offspring of plants carrying multiple heterozygote mutations in two or more of the <italic>CUC</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS151C54">Vroemen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Expressing a conifer gene in an angiosperm does not necessarily provide functional information relevant for conifers. However, a functional substitution is indicative of an evolutionary conservation of a regulatory pathway.</p><p>We have shown here that the temporal expression of <italic>PaNAC01</italic>, and its regulation by PAT during somatic embryo development, is similar to that of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Our phylogenetic reconstruction and motif analysis, together with the fact that PaNAC01 can functionally substitute for CUC2, indicate that PaNAC01 and CUC1 and CUC2 act in an evolutionarily conserved pathway. Central parts of the regulatory network for SAM and cotyledon formation can thus be regarded as conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms, indicative of a common ancestral function present already 300 million years ago.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aob/mcs151/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available online at www.aob.oxfordjournals.org and consist of the following.
