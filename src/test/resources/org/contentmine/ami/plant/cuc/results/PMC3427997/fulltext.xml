Although eukaryotic cold shock domain proteins have been extensively studied as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators during various developmental processes, their functional roles in plants remains poorly understood. In this study, AtCSP3 (At2g17870), which is one of four <italic><underline>A</underline>rabidopsis <underline>t</underline>haliana</italic>
<underline>c</underline> old <underline>s</underline> hock domain <underline>p</underline>roteins (AtCSPs), was functionally characterized. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed high expression of <italic>AtCSP3</italic> in reproductive and meristematic tissues. A homozygous <italic>atcsp3</italic> loss-of-function mutant exhibits an overall reduced seedling size, stunted and orbicular rosette leaves, reduced petiole length, and curled leaf blades. Palisade mesophyll cells are smaller and more circular in <italic>atcsp3</italic> leaves. Cell size analysis indicated that the reduced size of the circular mesophyll cells appears to be generated by a reduction of cell length along the leaf-length axis, resulting in an orbicular leaf shape. It was also determined that leaf cell expansion is impaired for lateral leaf development in the <italic>atcsp3</italic> loss-of-function mutant, but leaf cell proliferation is not affected. <italic>AtCSP3</italic> loss-of-function resulted in a dramatic reduction of <italic>LNG1</italic> transcript, a gene that is involved in two-dimensional leaf polarity regulation. Transient subcellular localization of AtCSP3 in onion epidermal cells confirmed a nucleocytoplasmic localization pattern. Collectively, these data suggest that AtCSP3 is functionally linked to the regulation of leaf length by affecting <italic>LNG1</italic> transcript accumulation during leaf development. A putative function of AtCSP3 as an RNA binding protein is also discussed in relation to leaf development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>cold shock domain proteins</kwd><kwd>leaf development.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cold shock domain (CSD) is regarded as one of the most conserved protein domains that is widespread from bacteria to mammals. The CSD contains two consensus RNA binding motifs (RNP-1 and RNP-2) which facilitate functions such as nucleic acid binding, RNA chaperone activity, post-transcriptional regulation, and transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Graumann and Marahiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Sommerville, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Horn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In eukaryotes, cold shock domain proteins contain various N-terminal and C-terminal auxiliary domains in addition to the CSD. The well studied human cold shock domain protein (Y-box binding protein-1, YB-1) performs pleiotropic roles in gene transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and external stimuli response such as drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Kohno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). YB-1 activation by Akt-mediated phosphorylation results in its translocation to the nucleus, leading to the regulation of cell proliferation in human ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Basaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition, phosphorylation of YB-1 mediated by Akt-1 is regarded as the inducer for increased expression of genes related to cell proliferation and stress response by the translation of silent mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Since Kingsley and Palis first described plant cold shock domain proteins (CSPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Kingsley and Palis, 1994</xref>), functional studies have been initiated in rice, wheat, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. A subsequent phylogenetic analysis of plant CSPs confirmed that they are highly conserved in the Plant Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Karlson and Imai, 2003</xref>). A wheat CSP (WCSP1), two rice CSPs (OsCSP1, OsCSP2), and four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CSPs (AtCSPs, CSDPs) have been confirmed as functional nucleic acid binding proteins. Collective studies in plants suggest a putative functional role as RNA chaperones, although the precise biological role of cold shock domain proteins <italic>in planta</italic> remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Nakaminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Fusaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Chaikam and Karlson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">Yang and Karlson, 2011</xref>). The first functional analysis for an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CSP (<italic>AtGRP2</italic>/<italic>AtCSP2/CSDP2</italic>; At4g38680) by RNAi-induced gene silencing resulted in early flowering, reduced stamen number, and abnormalities during seed embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Fusaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The relationship of plant CSPs to plant development was further supported by a recent detailed investigation monitoring the entire <italic>AtCSP</italic> gene family throughout all stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Nakaminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Recently, two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cold shock domain proteins (AtCSP3; At2g17870 and AtCSP1/AtCSDP1; At4g36020) have been functionally linked to abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Leaf organogenesis is divided into three stages: leaf initiation, establishment of leaf polarity, and cell expansion resulting in the final leaf shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">Tsukaya, 2005</xref>, 2006). In general, these stages are regulated by different gene groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Byrne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Barkoulas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Leaf shape is initially established in two parts; leaf petioles and leaf blades. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf blades expand in two-dimensions which are defined as leaf-length (longitudinal) and leaf-width (lateral) axes. The ratio of the two directions is used as the criterion to determine leaf blade shape, which is further determined by the cell distribution, cell size, and their interaction in the leaf lamina. Both directions of leaf expansion are regulated by the <italic>ANGUSTIFOLIA</italic> (<italic>AN</italic>) and <italic>ROTUNDIFOLIA</italic> (<italic>ROT</italic>) genes which regulate two independent directional processes, respectively. <italic>ROTUNDIFOLIA 3</italic> (<italic>ROT3</italic>) and <italic>ROTUNDIFOLIA 4</italic> (<italic>ROT4</italic>) are involved in the regulation of leaf length polarity growth. A null allele of <italic>rot3</italic> exhibits stunted leaf and floral growth and <italic>ROT3</italic> encodes Cytochrome P450 (CYP90C1) which is a late-step regulator in the brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Tsuge <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>, 2005). Over-expression of <italic>ROT3</italic> results in longer leaves in the longitudinal direction but is not altered in leaf width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). An activation tagging line (<italic>rot4-1D</italic>), whose protein encodes a membrane-bound small peptide, possesses a similar leaf shape phenotype as that of <italic>rot3</italic>, but its small leaf shape is caused by a decrease in cell proliferation unlike that of <italic>ROT3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Narita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Two other leaf-length regulation genes (<italic>LONGIFOLIA</italic>; <italic>LNG1</italic> and <italic>LONGIFOLIA2; LNG2</italic>), were shown to function independently of <italic>ROT3</italic>. An activation tagged line of <italic>lng1-1D</italic> exhibited a long leaf blade phenotype along with serrated margins and other elongated tissues. Loss-of-function mutants for <italic>lng1</italic> and <italic>lng2</italic> exhibited a shortened length of leaf blades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Regarding the regulation of leaf width, loss-of-function of <italic>ANGUSTIFOLIA</italic> (<italic>AN</italic>), <italic>SPIKE1</italic>, <italic>ANGUSTIFOLIA3</italic> (<italic>AN3</italic>)/<italic>GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR1</italic> (<italic>AtGIF1</italic>), and over-expression of <italic>AtHB13</italic> (<italic>OxAtHB13</italic>) caused a similar narrow leaf shape in the leaf-width direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Hanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Folkers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Qiu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Kim and Kende, 2004</xref>).

A loss-of-function mutant of <italic>AN3/AtGIF1</italic> and <italic>GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 5</italic> (<italic>AtGRF5</italic>) showed a narrow leaf phenotype in the leaf-length direction which is caused by the defect of cell numbers in leaf blades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Kim and Kende, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Horiguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). <italic>AN3</italic>, a homologue of the human transcription factor <italic>SYT</italic>, accumulated in leaf primordia and this pattern was in accordance with other AtGRFs, <italic>AtGRF5</italic> and <italic>AtGRF9</italic>, but not with <italic>AtGRF8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Horiguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

Our semi-quantitative RT-PCR data for <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (<italic>STM</italic>), <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1</italic> (<italic>AS1</italic>), <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> (<italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>), and <italic>PIN-FORMED 1</italic> (<italic>PIN1</italic>) genes using shoot apex and early leaf tissues did not identify any alteration in expression patterns (data not shown). These observations support the hypothesis that <italic>AtCSP3</italic> primarily functions during lateral leaf development. Our histological observations, which determined that the abnormal leaf cell shape and size of <italic>atcsp3</italic> are initiated during lateral leaf expansion, are in good accordance with this scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Expression analysis of a cell division marker gene (<italic>CYC3D;1</italic>) at 28 DAG did not reveal abnormalities as a result of <italic>atcsp3</italic> loss-of-function. Therefore, AtCSP3 appears to affect <italic>LNG1</italic> mRNA abundance independent of cell division regulation via an unknown mechanism. Observations of leaf phenotypes from the <italic>atcsp3</italic> mutants are in good accordance to published results from functional studies of LNG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Specifically, a correlation of reduced <italic>LNG1</italic> expression to a reduction in leaf-length was observed. LNG1 is a regulator of leaf-length specific cell expansion that functions independently of ROT3 and does not regulate expression of AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Our RT-PCR data for <italic>ROT3</italic> and <italic>AN</italic> genes in <italic>atcsp3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) are similar to those previously published in a study characterizing a <italic>lng1</italic> loss-of-function mutant; suggesting that AtCSP3 does not function in relation to ROT3 and AN during two-dimensional leaf expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Over-expression of <italic>LNG2</italic>, a homologue of <italic>LNG1</italic>, results in a narrow and long leaf phenotype. In addition, an <italic>lng1-3 lng2-1</italic> double mutant has an additive effect in leaf-length cell expansion. As revealed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, <italic>LNG1</italic> expression was majorly altered in the <italic>atcsp3</italic> mutants with no apparent effect on <italic>LNG2</italic> expression. However, independent data obtained from a comparative microarray study between the <italic>atcsp3-1</italic> mutant and the wild type revealed a minor reduction in <italic>LNG2</italic> transcript (data not shown). Thus, it is hypothesized that AtCSP3 primarily affects <italic>LNG1</italic> gene function, contributing to a reduction in cell length along the leaf-length direction and there may be additive contribution from <italic>LNG2</italic> due to a marginal reduction in transcripts. Although this targeted investigation of a sub-set of leaf-development related genes identified a predominant change in <italic>LNG1</italic> expression, additional transcriptome analyses may reveal additional development-related genes that are affected by the disruption of AtCSP3 function and may also function to regulate cell expansion in the <italic>atcsp3</italic> mutants.</p><p content-type="indent">To date, all plant CSPs tested including OsCSP1, OsCSP2, <italic>AtGRP2</italic>/<italic>CSDP2</italic>/<italic>AtCSP2</italic>, AtCSDP1, AtCSP3, and WCSP1 exhibit nucleic acid binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Karlson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Nakaminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Fusaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Chaikam and Karlson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). AtCSP3 melts nucleic acids and complements a bacterial mutant lacking four endogenous cold shock proteins, supporting the hypothesis that AtCSP3 functions as an RNA chaperone in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Our transient subcellular localization experiment confirmed that AtCSP3 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), consistent with a previous report of stably transformed AtCSP3:GFP fusion protein in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In humans, the RNA binding activity of the YB-1 cold shock domain protein activates the translation of silent RNA for genes relating to cell proliferation, malignant transformation, and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, the NAB1 cold shock domain protein also regulates LHCBM mRNA stabilization, resulting in the induction of LHCBM protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Mussgnug <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Importantly, biochemical analysis of recombinant AtCSP3 protein confirmed that it possesses nucleic acid chaperone activity which induces the unwinding of double-stranded DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that AtCSP3 may exert a similar role and positively affect <italic>LNG1</italic> transcripts during leaf cell expansion during the generation of lateral leaves.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Analysis of flowering time and seedling size</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flowering time (DAG)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fresh weight (mg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sample size (n)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Col-0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5 &#x000b1; 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.88 &#x000b1; 1.28</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">395.5 &#x000b1; 14.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">atcsp3-3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5 &#x000b1; 0.90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.58 &#x000b1; 1.62</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">371.5 &#x000b1; 17.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">atcsp3-2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.25 &#x000b1; 0.97</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.83 &#x000b1; 2.53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">256.5 &#x000b1; 26.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">atcsp3-1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.58 &#x000b1; 0.79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.33 &#x000b1; 2.31</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">189.6 &#x000b1; 13.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec>
