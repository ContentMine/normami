Rice is considered to be a salt-sensitive crop, and excess salt levels adversely affect all the major metabolic activities, causing cell wall damage, cytoplasmic lysis or genomic instability
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In order to cope with salt stress, plants have evolved high degrees of developmental plasticity, including adaptation via cascades of molecular networks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and changes in gene expression profiles
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Post-transcriptional regulation also plays an important role in the plant response to salinity conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The microRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of endogenous, non-coding, small RNAs (21&#x02013;24 nucleotides in length) that were demonstrated to play crucial roles in the modulation of gene expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Plant miRNAs originate from hairpin precursors (pre-miRNA) after two sequential cleavages performed by DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1). Mature miRNAs are then incorporated into the RISC complex (RNA-induced silencing complex) and negatively regulate the expression of specific mRNA targets through mRNA cleavage, decay or translational repression by base-pairing with its targets
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The first miRNA (lin-4) discovered in 1993 was reported to be involved in the regulation of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> larval development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since then, an increasing interest has been devoted for the study of miRNAs both in animals and plants. After the first identification of miRNAs in <italic>Arabidopis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a great number of plant miRNAs have been identified by computational means
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Many miRNA genes are conserved in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, indicating that their origin forfeit the divergence between monocotiledonate and dicotiledonate plants. In plants, miRNAs generally interact with their targets through near-perfect complementarity and leads to target mRNA cleavage. The high degree of sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their target mRNAs allowed the prediction of targets using algorithms that scan the genome for mRNA-miRNA complementarity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the predicted targets must be experimentally validated in order to confirm their function.</p><p>Plant miRNAs have been predicted or confirmed to regulate a wide variety of developmental and physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, plant development, signal transduction, stress response and pathogen invasion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recent findings have demonstrated that many plant miRNAs can be induced by biotic or abiotic stress and they may play an important role in the process of adaptation to adverse environmental conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For example, miR398 and miR408 were up-regulated in response to water deficit in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], miR393 was found to be strongly up-regulated by cold, dehydration, NaCl and ABA treatments, while miR389a proven to be down-regulated in response to these treatments in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, miR171e was demonstrated to be involved in the resistance to blight while the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miR399 was induced by low-phosphorus, and miR160 and miR167 are UV-B-responsive
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In rice, a set of miRNAs that putatively control different helicase genes were recently identified by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Helicases are enzymes that catalize the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an energy-dependent manner. Among helicases, the DEAD-box family is by far the largest family and it is characterized by the presence of nine conserved motifs that were demonstrated to be involved in the ATPase and helicase activities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Helicases are implicated in a wide range of processes such as recombination, replication and translation initiation, double-strand break repair, maintenance of telomere length, nucleotide excision repair, cell division and proliferation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recent reports indicate that the expression of genes encoding helicases is also regulated in response to changes in specific environmental conditions, including temperature, light, oxygen or osmolarity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, the ectopical expression of PDH45 (Pea DNA Helicase 45) helicase, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, resulted into salinity stress tolerance both in tobacco and rice plants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. <italic>PDH45</italic> gene was shown to confer high salinity stress tolerance also in bacteria (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, BL2 cells)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the expression profiles of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR408 and osa-MIR164e along with their targeted genes, were investigated in relation with the early response to salinity stress. The present miRNAs were predicted to target the putative helicases <italic>OsABP</italic> (ATP-Binding Protein), <italic>OsDSHCT</italic> (DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase) and <italic>OsDBH</italic> (DEAD-Box Helicase) included in the DEAD-box family. No information concerning the activity of these helicases are currently available in plants. An <italic>in silico</italic> characterization of the proteins was performed and the miRNAs predicted targets were validated by RLM-5&#x02032;RACE. Wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the <italic>PDH45</italic> gene were used in the present study in order to assess if there are differences between sensitive and tolerant rice plants to early salinity stress conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and treatments</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> subsp<italic>. indica</italic>) cultivar IR64 was used in the present study.

The short-term response to salinity stress may be particularly relevant to better understand the biological significance of stress status in plant responses to salinity.</p><p>A preliminary characterization of the stress response in rice was carried out by measuring the chlorophyll content and the free proline levels. The damage caused by salt stress was evident from the degree of bleaching observed in the leaf tissues, along with a decrease in chlorophyll content. However, the reduction in chlorophyll content was significantly higher in WT plants, compared with TR plants. Since the goal of this study was to test the plant response to early-induced salinity stress, the free proline levels were measured at 3 and 6 h post-treatment. Significant increase in free proline was observed in response to both NaCl concentrations (100 and 200 mM) at 6 h after treatment.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The NAC-domain genes are required for organ separation. When miR164 was ectopically expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, it resulted into floral organ fusion and cotyledon fusion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>No information regarding the activity of OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT helicases are currently available in plants. In consequence, a thorough bioinformatic investigation was carried out to analyze and compare in detail the structural features of the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT proteins. The three proteins harbour the DEAD domain and the helicase C-terminal domain, typically conserved motifs found in helicase superfamily. The similarity search showed that OsABP and OsDBH were close to RNA helicase 31 and DNA helicase RecQl5, respectively, while the OsDSHCT revealed high similarity with the SKI2/DOB1 protein. RNA helicase 31 is a member of the DEAD-box family, possessing ATP-dependent helicase activity and RNA-binding property
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The RecQ helicases have been shown to play important roles in DNA repair, recombination and replication, consistent with their intrinsic DNA helicase activities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Recently it was proved that the RecQl5 helicase promotes genome stabilization through interaction with RNA polymerase II
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The SKI/DOB1 proteins are essential ATP-dependent RNA helicases that play crucial roles in ribosome synthesis and the degradation of cytoplasmic mRNAs following poly (A)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A recent report on OsABP revealed that the gene is up-regulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments including NaCl, dehydration, ABA, blue and red light
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Although a large number of DEAD box proteins were identified by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis as putative predicted helicases, the confirmation of helicase activity was demonstrated only for few of them
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In plants, two DEAD-box-related helicases termed PDH47 and PDH45 were proven to be induced by a variety of abiotic stresses including salinity, cold, heat and ABA treatments, suggesting that they are components of a general stress response mechanism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Recently, a single subunit of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MCM6) from pea was reported to function as DNA helicase and to promote salinity stress tolerance without affecting yield
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Nonetheless the few references, genes encoding helicases were proven to be induced in response to salinity stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The stress-responsive gene expression results in metabolites accumulation, alteration of biochemical and physiological pathways, vital for the plant adaptation to stress conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the present study, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the <italic>OsABP</italic>, <italic>OsDBH</italic> and <italic>OsDSHCT</italic> genes are up-regulated in response to salinity stress in both WT and TR plants. However, a higher accumulation of the gene transcripts was observed in WT plants, except for the <italic>OsABP</italic> transcript that showed the highest level in TR plants treated with 200 mM NaCl. The differences observed between the experimental conditions and the control might be due to changes in transcriptional activity. However, some differences might result from the action of miRNAs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The effects of miRNA directed mRNA degradation can be detectable through changes in the expression profiles of miRNA targeted genes. Our results shown that osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408 were down-regulated in WT and TR rice plants challenged with salinity stress. Considering the fact that the targeted helicases were up-regulated and the miRNAs were down-regulated in relation to early-induced salt stress, we can state that the negative correlation between these miRNAs and their validated targets is certified. The levels of accumulation or decrease in the transcript levels is most visible in the case of TR plants, where the 0.9-fold decrease in the osa-MIR414 expression resulted into 15.1-fold up-regulation of <italic>OsABP</italic> gene.</p><p>Several recent papers have described the miRNAs involvement in the response to various stress conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. miR408 was shown to accumulate at low levels in plants under standard conditions and its accumulation was highly induced by drought and heavy-metals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since miRNAs can be targeted by more than one gene, a recent study demonstrated that AGO1 and AGO2 could act redundantly in the miR408-mediated plastocyanin regulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miR164 family comprises three members, miR164a, miR164b and miR164c, which negatively regulate several genes that encode NAC-like transcription factors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In the present study, osa-MIR164e was identified and its target, a DEAD-box helicase, validated. Both osa-MIR408 and osa-MIR164e are responsive to early salinity stress conditions. miR164 and miR408 were proven to be responsive also to cold and drought conditions in Euphorbiaceae plants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several miRNAs that displayed different activities during salt stress were recently identified in <italic>Zea mais</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The authors shown that miR164 was down-regulated after 24 h of salt shock, while its target NAC1 (an early auxin-responsive gene) was up-regulated. A similar study showed that miR156, miR166, miR171, miR172, miR319, miR164 along with their target genes, were differentially expressed in stress-tolerant maize hybrids compared with stress-sensitive lines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. As for osa-MIR414, no other information was available in the literature. It was predicted to target six different helicases in rice plants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we validated the <italic>OsABP</italic> gene as one of its targets and shown the changes in their expression profiles under early salt stress conditions. However, further analysis is still needed in order to better characterize the miRNAs involvement in salinity stress as well as the function of their validated targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408 were experimentally validated for the first time in plants as targeting the <italic>OsABP</italic>, <italic>OsDBH</italic> and <italic>OsDSHCT</italic> genes. OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT represent newly identified DEAD-box helicases in rice. Their function still needs to be experimentally validated. The expression profiles of the miRNAs and their validated targets were tested under early-induced salinity stress conditions both in wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the PDH45 helicase. Our data showed that that the genes were up-regulated and the miRNAs were down-regulated in relation to salt stress. The negative correlation between the miRNAs and their targets was proven. The present results also highlights higher accumulation of the gene transcripts in WT plants when compared with TR plant, correlated with decrease in the miRNAs expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>miRNA: microRNA; RLM-5&#x02032;RACE: RNA ligase-mediated 5&#x02032; rapid amplification of cDNA ends; qRT-PCR: quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; OsABP: ATP-Binding Protein; OsDBH: DEAD-Box Helicase; OsDSHCT: DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase; PDH45: Pea DNA Helicase 45; NaCl: Sodium chloride; WT: Wild type; EV: Empty vector control; TR: Transgenic plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AM planned and performed all the experimental work.
