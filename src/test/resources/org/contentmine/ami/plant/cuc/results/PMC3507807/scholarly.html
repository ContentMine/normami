Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p>Control of the host transcriptome represents a key battleground in the interaction of plants and pathogens. Specifically, plants have evolved complex defense systems that induce profound transcriptional changes in response to pathogen attack while pathogens have evolved mechanisms to subvert or disable these defenses. Several NAC transcription factors such as ATAF2 have been linked to plant defense responses, including those targeting viruses. The replication protein of <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) has been shown to interact with and target the degradation of ATAF2. These findings suggest that the transcriptional targets of ATAF2 are involved in defense against TMV. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p>To detect potential ATAF2 transcriptional targets, a genomic pull-down assay was utilized to identify ATAF2 promoter binding sequences. Subsequent mobility shift and DNA footprinting assays identified a 30-bp ATAF2 binding sequence. An <i>in vivo</i> GUS reporter system confirmed the function of the identified 30-bp binding sequence as an ATAF2 specific transcriptional activator <i>in planta</i>. Gel filtration studies of purified ATAF2 protein and mutagenesis studies of the 30-bp binding sequence indicate ATAF2 functions as a dimer. Computational analysis of interacting promoter sequences identified a corresponding 25-bp A/T-rich consensus sequence with repeating [GC]AAA motifs. Upon ATAF2 induction real-time qRT-PCR studies confirmed the accumulation of select gene transcripts whose promoters contain this consensus sequence. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>We report the identification of a <i>cis</i>-regulatory binding sequence for ATAF2. Different from other known NAC protein binding sequences, the A/T-rich ATAF2 binding motif represents a novel binding sequence for NAC family proteins. Combined this information represents a unique tool for the identification of ATAF2 target genes. </p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Background</div> <p>Plants have evolved sophisticated sensing systems that utilize a multitude of components to translate the perception of a pathogen into the induction of defense responses. In particular, alterations in gene expression as directed by defense-associated transcription factors (TFs) such as ERF, NAC, WRKY, and bZip represent important host responses that occur during pathogen attack [ <a href="#B1">1</a>- <a href="#B3">3</a>]. In contrast, reprograming gene expression is an important strategy pathogens use to disable host defenses and enhance their ability to establish an infection. To counter the induction of these defenses pathogens have evolved mechanisms to override host transcriptional responses either through the targeted disruption of defense associated TFs or through the production of their own factors for controlling transcription [ <a href="#B4">4</a>, <a href="#B5">5</a>]. Characterization of pathogen targeted TFs and the regulatory networks they control are thus essential to developing a full understanding of plant defense responses. </p> <p>Previously, we reported that the Arabidopsis TF ATAF2 (At5g08790) is induced in response to a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) infection and that TMV subsequently targets ATAF2 for degradation through an interaction with the viral 126 kDa replication protein [ <a href="#B6">6</a>] . ATAF2 is a member of the NAC ( <div class="u_UNKNOWN">N</div>AM, <div class="u_UNKNOWN">A</div>TAF1/2, <div class="u_UNKNOWN">C</div>UC2) family of plant specific TFs and is induced in response to tissue wounding and pathogen infection [ <a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B7">7</a>]. We also observed that overexpression of ATAF2 resulted in the induction of salicylic acid (SA) mediated defense associated marker genes <i>PR1</i> and <i>PR2</i>, conversely these genes had reduced transcript levels in ATAF2 knockout or repressor lines [ <a href="#B6">6</a>]. Furthermore, ATAF2 overexpression inhibited TMV accumulation in inoculated tissues. These findings suggest that ATAF2 plays a role in the regulation of host basal defense responses and that TMV targets ATAF2 for degradation as a means to disrupt these defense pathways. </p> <p>NAC domain TFs such as ATAF2 make up a large plant specific family of proteins with ~105 NAC genes in Arabidopsis and ~ 75 in rice [ <a href="#B8">8</a>]. All members within this family contain a highly conserved N-terminal NAC domain and a divergent C-terminal transcription activation region (TAR). NAC genes have been widely reported to be involved in plant morphogenesis/organ development, senescence and abiotic/biotic stresses [ <a href="#B9">9</a>- <a href="#B13">13</a>]. In addition, several NAC proteins are reported to interact with viral proteins. These include interactions between the NAC containing GRAB proteins and the Geminivirus RepA protein [ <a href="#B14">14</a>] and the Arabidopsis TIP protein with the <i>Turnip crinkle virus</i> coat protein [ <a href="#B15">15</a>]. These interactions are implicated in the modulation of virus replication and the induction of host defense responses. Combined these findings suggest that NAC domain proteins are key TFs controlling molecular pathways that are of importance to virus biology. </p> <p>To further understand the role of ATAF2 in virus biology we utilized a genomic pull-down assay to identify potential ATAF2 target sequences from the Arabidopsis genome. An analysis of the DNA sequences bound by ATAF2 led to the identification of a 25-bp ATAF2 specific consensus binding sequence. This binding sequence is sufficient to promote ATAF2 mediated gene transcription and is unique in comparison to previously reported NAC protein binding domains [ <a href="#B16">16</a>, <a href="#B17">17</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Identification of ATAF2 binding sequences</div> <p>ATAF2 binding sequences were identified via an immuno-pull-down assay using purified hexa-histidine tagged ATAF2 and genomic DNA isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Shahdara. In addition, a hexa-histidine tagged ATAF2 deletion construct, ΔATAF2, lacking the putative DNA binding subdomains C and D, nucleotides 172 – 377, was used as a negative control (Figure <a href="#F1">1</a>A). In this assay the hexa-histidine tagged ATAF2 or ΔATAF2 proteins were mixed with <i>EcoR</i>I and <i>Taq</i>I cut Shahdara genomic DNA and precipitated using anti-PolyHis antibody [ <a href="#B18">18</a>]. Both ATAF2 and ΔATAF2 bound DNA fragments were subsequently PCR-amplified and cloned into a plasmid vector. The number of DNA clones derived from ATAF2 bound complexes (~600 clones) were 50-fold higher than that derived from ΔATAF2 bound complexes (12 clones), reflecting the deletion of the putative DNA binding regions. Of 97 ATAF2 clones randomly selected for sequencing 47 were located upstream and within 3000 basepairs (bp) of a known or predicted genomic translational start site (Table <a href="#T1">1</a>). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p> <b>ATAF2 binds DNA sequences from the genomic pull-down assay.</b> ( <b>A</b>) Schematic representation showing ATAF2 and <b>∆</b>ATAF2 deletion constructs.

Identification of a 30-bp ATAF2 binding sequence</div> <p>One clone showing a strong mobility shift in the presence of ATAF2, designated C34, was selected for further studies aimed at identifying the specific DNA sequences targeted by ATAF2. The C34 DNA clone is located upstream (−64 nt to −982 nt) of the coding region for the Arabidopsis defensin-like protein At1g68907. To determine the likelihood that the defensin-like gene was regulated by ATAF2 and thus a good candidate gene for further analysis, we examined its expression levels in two independent Arabidopsis ecotype Shahdara ATAF2 overexpression lines as well as in response to tissue wounding (Figure <a href="#F2">2</a>A) [ <a href="#B6">6</a>].

ATAF2 30-bp binding sequence functions in transcriptional activation</div> <p>To determine if the identified 30-bp segment was sufficient to promote <i>in vivo</i> transcriptional activation by ATAF2, we first used a yeast lacZ reporter system to determine if the ATAF2 and ΔATAF2 constructs, both of which contain the putative transcriptional activation region, can function as transcriptional activators in yeast when fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (Figure <a href="#F4">4</a>A). Results indicated that when fused to the LexA DNA binding domain both ATAF2 and ΔATAF2 proteins function in the transcriptional activation of the <i>LacZ</i> open reading frame (Figure <a href="#F4">4</a>A).

The resulting GUS reporter constructs were agroinfiltrated into leaves of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> in combination with 35S agro-expression constructs for ATAF2, ΔATAF2 or an empty cassette vector.

However, when the ATAF2 expression vector was co-infiltrated with either the 2X or 4X repeat constructs, GUS activity dramatically increased (Figure <a href="#F4">4</a>B). In contrast, the 35S minimal promoter construct yielded little GUS activity when co-expressed with the ATAF2 expression vector. Furthermore, the co-expression of 2X or 4X repeat constructs with the ΔATAF2 construct, which lacks the putative ATAF2 DNA binding domain, also failed to induce significant GUS activity (Figure <a href="#F4">4</a>B).

TMV infection increases GUS activity driven by the 30-bp ATAF2 binding element</div> <p>Previously, we demonstrated the transcriptional induction of ATAF2 within TMV inoculated leaf tissues [ <a href="#B6">6</a>].

GUS activity was quantified two days post agro-infiltration. Both the levels of ATAF2 mRNA as well as GUS activity increased within agro-infiltrated mock-inoculated tissues, indicating that agro-infiltration alone is sufficient to induce ATAF2 (Figure <a href="#F5">5</a>A). However, within TMV infected tissues, both 2X and 4X constructs containing the 30-bp regulatory sequence displayed significantly greater increases in GUS activity (averaging ~2-fold increases across treatments) than observed in mock-inoculated tissues or tissues infiltrated with the 35S minimal promoter construct (Figure <a href="#F5">5</a>C). This result corresponds with the higher levels of ATAF2 mRNA detected in the TMV infected leaves (Figure <a href="#F5">5</a>A and B).

Mutational analysis of the ATAF2 binding element</div> <p>To analyze the identified ATAF2 binding element, three substitutions replacing 5 to 6 nucleotides within the 30-bp binding sequence were created and tested both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> (Figure <a href="#F6">6</a>A). Substitutions were designed to alter segments of the binding element to determine if any specific region played a greater role in ATAF2 binding.

Discussion</div> <p>The induction of basal resistance responses can significantly impact virus accumulation and spread even within a susceptible host [ <a href="#B23">23</a>]. Thus, methods aimed at enhancing basal resistance could provide novel approaches for creating new forms of disease resistance. A number of studies indicate that SA mediates several anti-viral pathways that contribute to host basal defenses [ <a href="#B23">23</a>, <a href="#B24">24</a>]. Recent studies by Lee et al., [ <a href="#B25">25</a>] suggest that during TMV infections SA-mediated signaling controls resistance mechanisms that involve the alternative oxidase pathway, RDR1 mediated RNA silencing systems, and other as yet uncharacterized defenses. These findings indicate that anti-viral defenses require the regulation of multiple host processes. Subsequently, viruses likely encode multiple countermeasures aimed at overcoming these defenses. The targeted degradation of ATAF2 by TMV suggests that this TF regulates host processes that affect the infection cycle. This possibility is supported by studies that show overexpression of ATAF2 leads to the induction of defense related genes and enhanced plant resistance to TMV [ <a href="#B6">6</a>]. In contrast, T-DNA knockout or transcription repressor plant lines show a marked decrease in the activation of these defense-associated genes. In particular, SA associated defense genes including <i>PR1</i> and <i>PR2</i> are reduced in transcriptional activation in the absence of ATAF2, either by knockout, transcriptional repression or TMV directed degradation [ <a href="#B6">6</a>]. These findings indicate that ATAF2 functions to enhance host basal defense processes and that its targeted degradation represents a potential TMV-directed counterdefense mechanism. </p> <p>To better understand the ability of ATAF2 to regulate host gene expression we sought to characterize ATAF2’s function in the transcriptional regulation of cellular processes. The highly divergent C-terminal TAR regions of NAC proteins are thought to confer transcriptional activation of specific cellular functions including developmental and defense signaling pathways [ <a href="#B19">19</a>, <a href="#B26">26</a>, <a href="#B27">27</a>]. In yeast, the C-terminal TAR region of ATAF2 functioned to induce lacZ gene expression (Figure <a href="#F4">4</a>A), confirming ATAF2’s role as a transcriptional activator. Subsequently, a hexa-histidine-tagged ATAF2 protein readily functioned to pull-down Arabidopsis genomic DNA derived from the promoter regions of diverse genes. A representative sequence located within 1000 bp of the translational start site for the defensin-like protein At1G68907 was subsequently used to identify a 30-bp sequence that functioned as a <i>cis</i>-regulatory binding sequence for ATAF2. Most notably when co-expressed <i>in planta</i> with ATAF2 this 30-bp sequence directed the expression of a GUS reporter construct (Figure <a href="#F4">4</a>B). This 30-bp sequence also directed <i>in planta</i> GUS expression in response to a TMV infection (Figure <a href="#F5">5</a>). Thus, the induction of endogenous ATAF2 in response to infection is sufficient to drive gene expression from the identified ATAF2 binding sequence. Tissue wounding is also known to induce the transcription of ATAF2 [ <a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B7">7</a>]. Subsequent analysis of the transcript levels from nine of the original ATAF2 pull-down clones showed that eight were transcriptionally reduced by at least 2 fold in wounded tissues of the ATAF2 KO line in comparison to wounded tissues of the wild-type plant line (Table <a href="#T2">2</a>). The reduced transcriptional activation of these genes in the absence of ATAF2 indicates that ATAF2 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of these genes, further confirming the importance of the identified ATAF2 binding sequence within the promoters of these genes. </p> <p>Wound induced activation of genes identified in the original ATAF2 pull-down assay indicated that these genes contain ATAF2 specific binding sequences. Motif analysis searches using the identified 30-bp binding sequence and promoter sequences shown to regulate gene expression upon the induction of ATAF2 or bind ATAF2 directly showed the presence of a 25-bp consensus sequence that was subsequently found in all analyzed pull-down sequences (Table <a href="#T1">1</a>). The identified 25-bp sequence is A/T rich and contains repeats of a [CG]AAA motif either consecutively or in reverse orientation. Previous studies have identified several NAC family DNA binding elements. In one study, <i>in vitro</i> selection was used to identify the DNA binding site of two functionally diverse NAC proteins: ANAC019, implicated in stress, and ANAC092, implicated in morphogenesis [ <a href="#B16">16</a>]. A core binding element of CGT[GA] was identified. This sequence is the reverse complement of the core binding sequence identified from three NAC proteins (ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072) that recognizes a 63-bp sequence harboring CACG as the core DNA binding site [ <a href="#B28">28</a>]. Combined these findings suggest that diverse NAC proteins can bind similar sequences. However, other NAC proteins appear to bind different sequences. For example, NAC1 binds to a 21-bp DNA fragment containing an <i>as-1</i> element (TGACG) [ <a href="#B19">19</a>]. In wheat, a NAC protein binding consensus sequence was identified as [AG]G[AT]NNCGT[AG]NNNNN[CT]ACGT[AC]A[CT][CT] [ <a href="#B29">29</a>]. These previously identified NAC binding sequences including their core binding motifs are not present within the identified ATAF2 binding sequence, suggesting that ATAF2 recognizes a binding sequence different from that used by other NAC proteins. The A/T rich nature of the ATAF2 binding domain does have similarities to other plant based transcription binding domains. For example, the regulatory region of the pea plastoxyanin gene promoter is similarly A/T rich and is recognized by proteins containing high mobility group box domains that presumably modulate gene expression [ <a href="#B30">30</a>]. This diversity in sequence recognition reflects the large family of NAC proteins and the wide range of functions assigned to this TF family. </p> <p>The 30 bp length of the DNA nuclease protected fragment and its nearly complete requirement for activity as determined by mutagenesis studies (Figure <a href="#F6">6</a>, <a href="#F7">7</a>) suggested ATAF2 functions as a multimer. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown several NAC proteins form and function as dimers [ <a href="#B19">19</a>, <a href="#B20">20</a>]. In addition, crystallographic data for ANAC019 reveals an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices with a defined dimer interface that promotes both homo- and hetero-interactions along with a positively charged face that is thought to promote DNA binding [ <a href="#B1">1</a>, <a href="#B31">31</a>]. To confirm the oligomeric status of ATAF2, purified ATAF2 NAC domain was examined through a size exclusion chromatography and a peak representing a dimeric form of the NAC domain was observed (Figure <a href="#F8">8</a>). Oligomerization of bacterial purified ATAF2 NAC domain suggests that ATAF2 likely functions as a dimer. Whether the functional ATAF2 oligomer is a homodimer or heterodimer formed with another NAC protein is unknown, but it is clear that the induction of ATAF2 in response to wounding or stress is required for the transcriptional activation of gene promoters encoding the identified binding sequence. </p> <p>The role of ATAF2 in basal defense is not as yet resolved. However, it is interesting to note that several of the ATAF2 target genes identified in this study have links to defense responses. For example, Polyamine Oxidase 3 protein (PAO3) displays significant transcript reductions within ATAF2 KO tissues, indicating it is positively regulated by ATAF2 (Table <a href="#T2">2</a>). Furthermore, polyamines are known to accumulate in response to a number of environmental stresses including pathogen attack [ <a href="#B32">32</a>]. PAO3 functions within the peroxiosome, catalyzing accumulated polyamines and producing H <sub>2</sub>O <sub>2</sub>[ <a href="#B33">33</a>]. Uehara et al. [ <a href="#B34">34</a>] proposed the production of H <sub>2</sub>O <sub>2</sub> from the catalysis of polyamines functions as a signal transducer for the activation of defense responses. Another example is the Oxidative Stress 3 protein (OXS3), which is also positively regulated by ATAF2. OXS3 is required for resistance to cadmium and co-localizes to the nucleus with the nucleosomal histone protein H4 where it is thought to function as a remodeling factor, moving the location of the nucleosome and altering gene expression [ <a href="#B35">35</a>]. Interestingly, cadmium treatment is linked to TMV resistance in plants and is correlated with the deposition of callose within the plasmodesmata and vascular tissues [ <a href="#B36">36</a>, <a href="#B37">37</a>]. Ueki and Citovsky [ <a href="#B38">38</a>] identified a cadmium induced <div class="u_UNKNOWN">G</div>lycine- <div class="u_UNKNOWN">R</div>ich <div class="u_UNKNOWN">P</div>rotein (cdiGRP) that localizes to the vascular cell walls and promotes callose deposition. Overexpression of cdiGRP enhanced TMV resistance while its knockdown results in increased virus spread. In both of the above examples, ATAF2 directed regulation of PAO3 and OXS3 could enhance virus resistance via the production of H <sub>2</sub>O <sub>2</sub> and the induction of cdiGRP, respectively. Such defense responses indicate that TMV’s targeted degradation of ATAF2 functions as an anti-defense countermeasure. However, confirming the role of ATAF2 in regulating these resistance pathways and their effect on mediating defense against TMV requires additional studies. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
