In this study, female gametophyte microarray data from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were integrated into the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> interactome database to generate a putative interaction map of the female gametophyte development including proteome map based on biological processes and molecular functions of proteins. Biological and functional groups as well as topological characteristics of the network were investigated by analyzing phytohormones, plant defense, cell death, transporters, regulatory factors, and hydrolases.

Flowering plants have two gametophytes: the female gametophyte (FG) and the male gametophyte. The FG (embryo sac) most commonly consists of seven cells and four different cell types, including one egg cell, one central cell, two synergid cells and three antipodal cells. The FG cells control many steps of the fertilization process. During pollen tube growth, the synergid cells produce a guidance cue that directs pollen tube growth to the ovule <xref rid="pone.0049931-Kasahara1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Following fertilization, the egg cell gives rise to the seed's embryo, and the central cell develops into the endosperm. Differentiation and development aspects of this tiny organ have been studied by many groups, resulting in the identification of many specific genes that are necessary for FG development. Several expression-based studies have complemented forward genetics approaches which led to the identification of hundreds, but not all of the FG-expressed genes <xref rid="pone.0049931-Pagnussat1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, there are some efforts to understand how the FG derives its specificity; which genes are expressed differentially in the embryo sac cell types and how these genes are regulated. A few of these genes have been analyzed functionally, such as <italic>FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE)</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0049931-Portereiko1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>There is no report, however, about the interaction networks that underlie these biological processes. It should be noted that proteins have many important roles, not only at the single cell level but also at the tissue level. They act as catalysts, structural components, messengers, regulators and interact in a very concerted network of different pathways. The protein interaction (PI) network helps researchers to better understand these biological systems.</p><p>PI networks can be constructed using both experimental and computational methods. Experimental methods, such as yeast two-hybrid and tandem affinity purification, are reliable methods to extract direct interactions, but these methods are difficult to use on a large scale, which results in incomplete networks and a limited number of discovered interactions <xref rid="pone.0049931-Skrabanek1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In fact, these methods also suffer from the low coverage of protein interactions. In addition, a complete interactome for many organisms is not available. Therefore, computational methods play pivotal role to predict interactions using available biological data.</p><p>Several computational methods have been developed to predict dynamic PI networks based on their action at the molecular level (molecular function) or their performance at the cellular level (biological process) including co-evolution pattern, co-expression, co-occurrence in interacting proteins, protein domains and phenotypes, sequence and protein structure <xref rid="pone.0049931-Shoemaker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Co-occurrence hypothesis assumes that some proteins with related functions are co-regulated as gene clusters or presented in unit-like operons. The main idea in co-evolution based methods is that functionally linked proteins have correlated evolution changes and mutual selective pressure. In co-expression method, the hypothesis proposes that a protein complex is composed of functional subunits, and consequently, expression levels of all subunits should be correlated. To predict protein-protein interactions, co-expression method searches for the relative expression levels of subunits in gene expression data and finds significant correlation between them <xref rid="pone.0049931-Shoemaker2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Large amounts of PI data have been generated by both computational and experimental methods. These data are stored and are available for biological researches. Two of most comprehensive interaction databases are the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Bader1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Salwinski1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Studies aimed at elucidating the PI networks, involved in different human biological processes, have been carried out by integrating available transcription and interaction data <xref rid="pone.0049931-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. By exploiting this method, He <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0049931-He1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> constructed a dynamic protein-protein interaction network for the floral transition process in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In addition, Yu <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) constructed a chloroplast PI network based on literature-mined data and computational methods <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since genome sequences of many organisms are now available, different groups have tried to predict PI networks of them using computational methods. The predicted interactions are integrated into softwares such as Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD). Besides protein-protein interactions, Pathway Studio enables us to understand other interaction types of proteins with small molecules, their relations with biological processes and molecular function of PIs <xref rid="pone.0049931-Nikitin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Indeed, experimental based data can be used to draw out more specific and reliable PI networks involved in different biological mechanisms of an organism.</p><p>This work is the first attempt to construct <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> FG developmental PI networks based on the molecular functions and biological processes of proteins by integrating computational and experimental based data. The main strategy was to select upregulated and downregulated genes using available microarray data. Then the data were employed to construct PI network, based on shortest path algorithm by Pathway Studio software. In shortest path method, shortest paths between selected protein and any protein in the biological group can be found. Consequently, this method finds the closest protein in biological group regulating genes in FG development.</p><p>PathwayStudio is a pathway analysis tool supplied with RESNET database. PathwayStudio harvests latest information from deposited literature in PubMed and other public sources. The software also uses a number of public and commercial databases such as KEGG (metabolic database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>), BIND (protein interaction database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bind.ca">http://www.bind.ca</ext-link>), and GO (Gene Ontology) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Nikitin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. RESNET product includes database of relations for mammalians and plants as well as molecular network databases for model organisms such as plant model, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Plant RESNET contains protein-protein relations which include protein-protein binding, expression regulation, promoter binding, protein modification, effects of different proteins and environmental conditions on small molecule and metabolite synthesis, molecular synthesis relations, regulation of proteins by plant hormones, and unknown regulation from small molecule to a protein.</p><p>In next step, we carried out a deep analysis on both structural and biological aspects of the constructed network to provide comprehensive information on different interactions which may happen in the cell such as protein-protein interactions, protein complexes, small molecule synthesis, and expression regulation. Furthermore, since a network is composed of subnetworks, we extracted small subnetworks of some specific proteins to find the possible relations with other subnetworks.</p><p>In addition, we sought for essential proteins based on topological analysis of the networks. Several algorithms were designed to find essential nodes/hubs in the networks. The bottleneck (BN) and double screening scheme (DSS) methods were used in our analysis. Bottleneck nodes are defined using topological feature &#x0201c;betweenness&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is the total number of nonredundant shortest paths going through a certain node or edge <xref rid="pone.0049931-Girvan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Nodes with the high betweenness are major intersections between clusters. If bottlenecks are removed, a network can be partitioned and biologically they are usually essential proteins. Idowu <italic>et al.</italic> (2004) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Idowu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> used degree and Bottleneck methods to identify the possible-essential proteins in the PI network of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.</p><p>DSS employs two methods for scoring: Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC) and Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component (DMNC). Lin <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> applied different scoring algorithms to analyze yeast PI dataset and evaluate the performance of all algorithms by the coverage of the essential proteins. Interestingly, in their study, 80% and 60% of the top 10 proteins found by DMNC and MNC have been identified as yeast essential proteins by previous experimental methods. However, they integrated DMNC and MNC methods as DSS and found that DSS improves hit rates up to 100%. After DSS, BN method has the high hit rate (60%) on the essential protein list.</p><p>In this investigation, novel upregulated and downregulated genes were identified in the networks and their predicted functions were discussed. Interestingly, novel genes were identified as critical/essential proteins which had not been reported previously. Furthermore, we uncovered relations of some important proteins with other proteins, molecules, and biological processes.

Much of this information is scattered throughout numerous scientific publications. Software systems can bring the relevant information together, organize and prepare the information for further analysis.</p><p>To construct our PI network, Pathway Studio software (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD) was used. Pathway Studio uses the RESNET Plant database, which is a comprehensive pathway and molecular interaction database in plant science. This database includes new aliases for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes and new entries from six other plants, including rice, barely, corn, tomato, potato and tobacco. The database also includes other data directories, such as PubMed and TAIR. Additionally, it has information on functional relationships and molecular interactions that have been obtained from the literature.</p><p>The software collects information using text-mining tool MedScan and process undertaken data by natural language processing (NLP). The language interprets them to logical concepts and extracts functional relationships between proteins, small molecules, and cellular processes. The software is equipped with several layout algorithms for drawing links and visualization of the network <xref rid="pone.0049931-Nikitin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>In an interaction network, each node is a protein or small molecule, and the nodes are connected to each other by edges. Connectivity, or degree, is the number of edges linked to a single node, which can be interpreted as the number of interacting partners of a given protein. The shortest paths between a given entity and its group were selected to construct the networks <xref rid="pone.0049931-Managbanag1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The shortest path length is the path with the smallest number of links between a pair of nodes <xref rid="pone.0049931-Barabasi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>The software defines two types of entities: simple or complex. Simple entities including proteins or small molecules have no components themselves and are atomic objects. Simple entities may be part of a network. By contrast, complex entities may also be part of a pathway. They differ from simple entities in that they may contain proteins involved in cell processes, functional classes such as enzyme families and protein complexes (a group of two or more proteins linked by non-covalent protein-protein interactions). To predict protein interactions, the software makes different groups of proteins and finds a relation between a protein and its group. So a biological group is container of one or more simple or complex entities and used for enrichment analysis using algorithms such as Fischer's Exact Test. Proteins in the groups can be moved to a pathway based on found relationships.</p><p>Networks were constructed based on molecular functions (to draw out clusters based on their related function) and biological processes with defined genes. The excel format of the networks are provided at the corresponding supplementary files. Each excel file of the networks has all relations and entities of the network. Non-directed links and arrows represent PIs and regulatory effect of interactions, respectively. Left- right arrow shows reciprocal interaction. Effects can be activation (+) or downregulation (&#x02212;) forms. PI modes of proteins include binding (physical interaction), protein modification of target molecule, direct regulation of target by physical interacting the protein with it, expression (changing the protein level of the target), promoter binding, molecular synthesis (changing the concentration of the small molecule by protein), molecular transport (protein changes the localization of the target), regulation (protein changes the activity of the target), and chemical reaction (protein works in e.g. enzyme catalyzing reactions). Additionally, the references of relations coming from literature are provided in &#x0201c;MedlineReference&#x0201d; column.</p><p>To analyze in depth, we subtracted (reduced) the primary network based on the biological processes into smaller networks or subnetworks.

Although different groups have studied FG transcriptome using various experimental methods such as forward genetics or microarray technique and produced informative expression data, but none of previous studies has investigated FG protein interaction network <xref rid="pone.0049931-Pagnussat1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Here in this study, PIs based on biological processes and small molecules were analyzed. Due to complexity of FG development which has been previously indicated by other researcher groups <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, PI network offers more visualize and understandable approach in analyzing FG development. Furthermore, this network can predict undiscovered proteins in FG development and highlight key proteins based on network topology.</p><p>To construct PI network, we obtained microarray output data produced by Yu <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and Steffen <italic>et al</italic>. (2007) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Upregulated genes as well as downregulated genes were selected and used to construct the PI network. An implication of this is the possibility of interactions between upregulated and downregulated proteins. We also hypothesized that downregulated proteins may help us to find bottleneck proteins or easily to say &#x0201c;bridges&#x0201d; between an activated and inactivated processes. On the other hand, by including downregulated proteins, the probability of a bias in the network toward the upregulated proteins reduces. There are potential biases in large interaction networks because of incomplete coverage of the networks and high number of edges for most studied proteins but interaction network is still the first choice for deciphering complex biological systems <xref rid="pone.0049931-Chautard1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>For construction of the networks, the shortest path method was used. The method identifies the shortest path length between two nodes to connect them <xref rid="pone.0049931-Managbanag1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This approach has been previously validated for construction of biological networks <xref rid="pone.0049931-Managbanag1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. They found that the shortest path method is a useful method for construction of longevity network. Also, they demonstrated that this method can reduce the size of the network and increase the possibility of the positive interactions compared to other methods.</p><p>Various pathways were observed in the network, such as reproduction, hormone-mediated signaling, response to stress, developmental process, signal transduction, seed development, flowering, pollen development and defense response. Previous functional studies indicated that different biological processes such as plant defense, regulation, signaling, reproduction and phytohormones are involved in FG development <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. PI network of such complex tiny organ would be considerably large. Therefore, we extracted subnetworks of previously identified up- and downregulated proteins from our constructed networks and analyzed their relations. Interconnections of these biological processes combined with the expression patterns of proteins provided the opportunity of analyzing the specification mechanism of different cell types of FG.</p><p>In the network based on the biological processes, PR-4 had interaction with salicylate and ethylene signal transduction pathways which is consistent with the findings of Glarebrook <italic>et al.</italic> (2003) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Glazebrook1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and Norman-Setterblad <italic>et al.</italic> (2000) <xref rid="pone.0049931-NormanSetterblad1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These investigations showed that PR-4 expression is induced in the JA and ethylene pathways. PR-4 also had a direct link to plant defense proteins. PR-4 also was found as critical node in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049931-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049931-g004">4B</xref>). Several plant defense proteins have been identified with significant fold changes using microarray experiments <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Steffen <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> identified several defensin-like proteins specific to synergid and central cells (DD2, DD25 and DD37). Defensin-like proteins are thought to have roles in plant disease resistance; however, they may also have other important roles in plant development. The maize defensin-like protein ZmES4 is active in synergid cells and is required for pollen tube burst. This protein is active on the potassium channel KZM1 as well <xref rid="pone.0049931-Amien1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>The Pc proteins have an important role in epigenetic control of development. MEA, one of the Pc proteins, was present as a bottleneck protein in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049931-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Mutations in MEA cause endosperm development in the absence of fertilization <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yadegari1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MEA showed an interesting subnetwork connected to PR-4, DFR and FAH1 subnetworks. MEA had connection to AT3G59380 with prenylation activity. This function is necessary for many proteins involved in cell division, growth and signaling. Prenylation facilitates membrane association and protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Mutation in AT3G59380 produces self-fertile flowers and fewer seeds in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0049931-Running1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Regarding to MEA and ORC2 relation, it was previously found that ORC2 is expressed in central cell and synergids <xref rid="pone.0049931-Collinge1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Various interactions of MEA with proteins involved in different biological processes such as proliferation, programmed cell death and plant defense are implications for being as a bottleneck protein.</p><p>Anthocyanin, a class of chemicals, plays a role in the pigmentation of fruits and flowers, developmental processes, and stress tolerance. DFR is one of the seven different flavonoid enzymes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that is a single-copy gene <xref rid="pone.0049931-Burbulis1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It is interacted with PR-4 and FAH-1 in the network.</p><p>The signaling pathways involved in FG development are not well understood, but these pathways are likely to be crucial for linking different processes during growth, differentiation, specification, and crosstalk between different cell types in the embryo sac and pollen <xref rid="pone.0049931-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The role of JA in signaling pathways has been extensively studied, and JA was shown to have important roles in reproductive processes <xref rid="pone.0049931-Kazan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In addition, some JA mutants in tomatoes were shown to have a sterile female phenotype <xref rid="pone.0049931-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Although transporters have been studied in relation to biotic and abiotic processes, little is known about their function in FG development. As an important node in the network, SEC14 is a major phospholipid in eukaryotic cells and is considered to be critical in different developmental and cellular processes. Various phosphatidylinositol-regulated genes are expressed specifically during different environmental conditions <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. AtSUC1 and ATPDIL1-2 were other transporters in the network. AtSUC1 has been shown expression in the FG of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0049931-Feuerstein1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. ATPDIL1-2 had also high level of expression in FG. PDI proteins have key roles in a variety of cells, especially in cells involved in protein secretion and storage <xref rid="pone.0049931-Houston1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Interestingly, CAT1 was identified as a critical node in the network implying central possible roles for transporters during FG development.</p><p>The results of this study indicate numerous interactions of phytohormones in the network. According to the network and the findings of Zhang and O'Neil <xref rid="pone.0049931-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, auxin and ethylene coordinate in the development of the female and male gametophytes. Pagnussat <italic>et al.</italic> (2009) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Pagnussat2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> showed that the patterning of FG depends on an asymmetric distribution of auxin during syncytial development, and its biosynthesis is location-specific.</p><p>ARF6 and ARF8 were found in the network based on the biological processes. ARF6 was also identified as a critical node in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049931-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). ARF8 is expressed in FG, and its expression stops after fertilization <xref rid="pone.0049931-Goetz1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Mutations in ARF8 and ARF6 result in female sterility <xref rid="pone.0049931-Nagpal1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This is consistent with the proposed role of ARF8 as a negative regulator of signal transduction in the ovules and during pistil growth before fruit initiation. The fold change for this gene was less than 0.66, but the protein plays an important role in ovules according to Goetz <italic>et al.</italic> (2006) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Goetz1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Recently, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> showed that ARF15 is expressed in antipodal cells. Auxin was linked to AT2G26740. Previously, Kiyosue <italic>et al.</italic> (1994) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Kiyosue1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> found that AT2G26740 expression is induced by auxin. Another interesting interaction was between DD31 and ethylene. It was shown that DD31 is expressed specifically in synergids <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Another considerable finding was the presence of calmodulin and calcium binding proteins in the network, including AT5G43035, ANNAT1, and ANNAT4. Using forward genetics, Pagnussat <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Pagnussat1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> showed that these two types of proteins are involved in the fusion of polar nuclei.</p><p>The interesting point is that distinct proteins belonging to certain families, such as those from the calmodulin and GGT families, are expressed in FG. It will be worthwhile to compare the promoters of all of the genes in a distinct family in future studies to find the answer of this phenomenon.</p><p>Surprisingly, there were some nodes related to cell death in the network. AMC6 is a member of the caspase family and induces apoptosis in yeast. FAH1 is a negative regulator of cell death. Cell death occurs in three types of cells during FG development, including three of four megaspores during megasporogenesis, antipodal cells during the late stage of FG development, and one of the synergid cells after entrance of the pollen tube. To date, a few mutation events affecting antipodal cells have been found <xref rid="pone.0049931-Kagi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Expression pattern analysis on these genes during FG development could be worthy to uncover more details.</p><p>Upregulated MYB98 was observed in the network. MYB98 plays specific roles in synergids and pollen tube guidance during FG development <xref rid="pone.0049931-Kasahara1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although little is known about cell-cell communication, recently Chevalier <italic>et al.</italic> (2011) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Chevalier1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> pointed evidences for existence of cell-cell communication and signaling pathways during FG development. Interestingly, in the present network, signaling pathways and signal transduction were predicted as overrepresented GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049931.s006">Table S6</xref>). Additionally, downregulated AHP2 (one of the six <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> histidine phosphotransfer proteins) involved in phosphorelay signaling system was predicted in the network. It appears that AHP2 plays a central role in signaling pathway during FG development <xref rid="pone.0049931-Chevalier1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The current network also shows interaction for DD39 with pollen development and ECA3. Besides expression in anthers, DD39 displays relatively strong expression in synergids and weak expression in egg cells <xref rid="pone.0049931-Steffen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. DD39 encodes a polygalacturonase that plays a role in degrading the pollen mother cell wall during microspore development. It may have the same role in egg and synergid cells during fertilization. EOSTRE as another predicted protein in the network, controls synergid cell fate. In <italic>eostre</italic> mutant, one of two synergids displays polarity similar to egg cell <xref rid="pone.0049931-Pagnussat3" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Analyzing subnetworks of genes affecting both male and female gametophytes in the context of PI network in future studies can uncover more secrets about their functional relations and differential regulatory mechanisms during reproduction.</p><p>According to Johnston <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, some genes downregulate in FG but upregulate in ovules of mutant <italic>coatlique</italic> lacking embryo sac. These genes such as AUXIN RESISTANT 2/3 (AXR2 and AXR3), SHORT INTERNODES (SHI), and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (SHM1) were observed in the network. Interestingly SHI, SHM1 and AUX3 were critical proteins in the network based on biological processes.</p><p>GO analysis based on biological processes and molecular function showed similar results to previous reports <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Metabolic and cellular processes were the largest categories. Involvement of many different pathways implies complexity of this tiny organ. Signaling and transporters among molecular function categories are interesting unknown choices for future studies. The significantly overrepresented GO terms were also related to hydrolase activity. This is consistent with the analysis of the microarray data showing upregulation of different hydrolase family proteins, such as glycosyl hydrolase proteins AT5G24540 and AT5G24550. As reviewed by Yang <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, a series of genes control cell cycle, embryo sac polarity, cell plate formation and cell specification during female gametogenesis. Consistent with these findings, our network has predicted all of significant biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049931.s006">Table S6</xref>). The glycoside hydrolase family has role in many biological processes, such as control of hormone levels and the defense response <xref rid="pone.0049931-Falk1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049931-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>Recently Wuest <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> reported cell type-specific expression profiles in the female gametophyte of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> using laser-assisted microdissection and microarray techniques. Additionally, Johnston <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> identified embryo sac expressed genes by genetic subtraction and microarray approaches. We looked for the identified genes by them are present in the network. Thirty six and 58 of FG identified genes by Wuest <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and Johnston <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> were found in our network, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049931.s008">Table S8</xref>). This analysis suggests that PI network can be extended by importing more FG expressed genes as preys. On the other hand, a number of selected upregulated and downregulated genes for construction of the networks could not build any edges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049931.s009">Table S9</xref>). This could be due to a lack of information about the function and biological process of many of these genes and their interactions which can be considered as a major factor for uncoverage of networks. Consequently, it is possible that many other proteins are not able to come into the network. It should be noted that the embryo sac and FG are arrested inside diploid tissues, and this makes mRNA isolation of the embryo sac cells difficult. Therefore, it is important to stress that the microarray data must be of the highest quality for constructing networks. Commonly, microarray data are verified by quantitative, reverse-transcriptase PCR; however, validations of this kind were not performed for all these data sets. Although, Wuest <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0049931-Wuest1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> used laser-assisted microdissection to carry out more precise expression analysis, they might have lost due to hard amplification of low abundant transcripts. In the other hand, they used additional methods such as promoter:reporter gene fusions but it is really hard to apply for all genes. Therefore, it is possible that some unrelated proteins were falsely included in the network. The PI database also potentially contains false positives and false negatives which can affect the networks.</p><p>In this study, a variety of computational biology approaches were used to address and reduce false positives or false negatives errors in the network. Here, literature was used as references for predicted relations in the network and also microarray output data was applied into the network as another evidence for expression of the network members in FG. In this case, it should be noticed that some level of errors (false positives or false negatives) in the inferred network are accounted for the software and its false interpretation from cited database. However, many other important nodes were identified that the structure of the network can be disrupted by removing them. These nodes are important proteins involved in FG development. For this claim, we used evidences for verification of predicted protein interactions including different computational methods, experimental based data and microarray output data. However, further experiments should be carried out in order to obtain a general validation the obtained results as a limitation of the work.</p><p>This study presents PI network of FG development based on the transcriptome and interactome data. For the first time, the network demonstrates functional relations among a large number of previously identified genes. Analysis of the previously identified proteins predicts that they interact with novel proteins which had not been reported before. PI network also provides considerable clues for further functional analysis by identifying critical or essential proteins for FG development using topological analysis of the network. This study highlights the unique capability of network construction in prediction of novel undiscovered proteins. Furthermore, this study shows that a more clear image of complex phenomena such as FG development can be prepared based on network analysis and finding essential proteins/hubs in network trough computational biology methods. The discovered essential proteins will serve as a basis for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0049931.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
