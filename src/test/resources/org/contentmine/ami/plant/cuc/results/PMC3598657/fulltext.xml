RNA was sequenced from seven different stages of seed development, yielding between 12 million and 78 million sequenced transcripts. These have been aligned to the 79,000 gene models predicted from the soybean genome recently sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Over one hundred gene models were identified with high expression exclusively in young seed stages, starting at just four days after fertilization. These were annotated as being related to many basic components and processes such as histones and proline-rich proteins. Genes encoding storage proteins such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin had their highest expression levels at the stages of largest fresh weight, confirming previous knowledge that these storage products are being rapidly accumulated before the seed begins the desiccation process. Other gene models showed high expression in the dry, mature seeds, perhaps indicating the preparation of pathways needed later, in the early stages of imbibition. Many highly-expressed gene models at the dry seed stage are, as expected, annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and dehydrins, which help preserve the cellular structures and nutrients within the seed during desiccation. More significantly, the power of RNA-Seq to detect genes expressed at low levels revealed hundreds of transcription factors with notable expression in at least one stage of seed development. Results from a second biological replicate demonstrate high reproducibility of these data revealing a comprehensive view of the transciptome of seed development in the cultivar Williams, the reference cultivar for the first soybean genome sequence.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Illinois Soybean Association, the United Soybean Board, and the Illinois-Missouri Biotechnology Alliance.

The recent sequencing of the soybean genome <xref rid="pone.0059270-Schmutz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> coupled with improvements in next-generation RNA sequencing technology allow a powerful way to study expression changes in thousands of genes throughout multiple stages of soybean seed development which influence such agronomically-important traits as oil and protein production, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. A recent increase in large scale soybean seed development studies using technologies such as microarrays <xref rid="pone.0059270-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and cDNA sequencing <xref rid="pone.0059270-Sha1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> emphasizes the importance of understanding the genetics underlying this crop's seed development pathway.</p><p>Carlson and Lersten <xref rid="pone.0059270-Carlson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> have reviewed the events in early soybean seed development, which may vary in exact timing depending on cultivar and environmental conditions. Soybeans are largely self-fertilizing and the first day the flower is fully open is usually considered the first day of fertilization. The stage when the soybean plant begins flowering is also known as R1 <xref rid="pone.0059270-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Around 3&#x02013;5 DAF (days after flowering) the embryo has a spherical shape (known as the globe or globular stage) with an acellular endosperm and a rudimentary vascular system developing through the outer integument (which will become the seed coat). The cotyledons initiate during the heart stage at about 8&#x02013;10 DAF, by which point the endosperm is almost entirely cellular; the inner and outer integuments have thickened to ten to fifteen cell layers each.</p><p>By 12&#x02013;14 DAF, approximately half of the available space in the seed is taken up by the endosperm, the cotyledons have begun to elongate, and the vascular system running through the outer integument becomes much more extensive. Around 17&#x02013;19 DAF, the endosperm begins to degenerate and its cellular contents are assimilated by the cotyledons, where organelles as well as protein and lipid globules have begun to form. By 22&#x02013;24 DAF, the cotyledons and primary leaves are well on their way towards their full size in the seed, and the primordium of the first trifoliate leaf begins to develop. The stages from 12 DAF to 24 DAF tend to occur between R3 and R4 in this experiment, with seeds found in pods between 5 mm and 15 mm long <xref rid="pone.0059270-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Later stages of soybean seed development have been well-described by <xref rid="pone.0059270-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Between the stages of R4 and R7 the seeds grow rapidly, accumulating nutrients and storage proteins. During R6, the vegetative parts of the parent plant start to turn yellow and leaf senescence begins. The accumulation of nutrients slows down in the seeds and by R7, virtually all the seed&#x02019;s dry weight has been acquired. In the cultivar Williams used here, the total fresh weight of the seed peaks around 400&#x02013;500 mg. After this point the seed starts to desiccate and turn yellow, and the total fresh weight of the seed decreases as water is lost. At this point the seed contains a large embryo with cotyledons, primary leaves, and a primordium for the first trifoliate leaf, all surrounded by a three-layer dry seed coat <xref rid="pone.0059270-Carlson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. By stage R8, almost all of the pods and seeds have turned brown and dry and the embryos are quiescent. Later, when the seed imbibes water and begins germination, metabolic activity can restart immediately using enzymes, initiation and elongation factors, and other compounds that were produced during development and stored <xref rid="pone.0059270-Bewley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Previously, we examined gene expression changes during stages from mid-maturation to full maturation, the period of the most intensive seed fill, using microarrays <xref rid="pone.0059270-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Here, we use the power of high-throughput RNA sequencing technology, including very young stages starting at just a few days after flowering, as well as later mature seed stages, to elucidate expression patterns across a broad period of seed development revealing the entire transcriptome.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Stages and Replicates Used</title><p>Seven stages of soybean seeds were studied, encompassing major milestones in development such as tissue differentiation, nutrient accumulation, storage protein synthesis, and desiccation as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t001">Table 1</xref>.

Most of the gene models have comparatively low RPKMs at all the other stages of development, with a maximum RPKM of 125 throughout the first five stages. Of the 108 transcription factor genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, 21 models (19.4%) are annotated as AP2/ERF transcription factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t006">Table 6</xref>). Another 10% are annotated as CCAAT-binding transcription factors. Other transcription factor annotations found in this cluster included bZIP, no apical meristem (NAM), and zinc fingers. These gene models show similar expression in Biological Replicate 2 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor genes can also be grouped into families according to their annotations (gene models listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059270.s005">Table S2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4E</xref> shows that transcription factors annotated as AP2/ethylene responsive factors (with RPKM&#x02265;25 in at least one stage) display a variety of shapes throughout seed development. Some members of the family are most highly expressed during the early stages, such as 12&#x02013;14 DAF or 22&#x02013;24 DAF whole seed, while others appear to peak in expression at the final, dry seed stage. A similar variety in expression patterns is found in data from Biological Replicate 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>The no apical meristem (NAM) transcription factors have a much more uniform expression pattern, at least those gene models with RPKM&#x02265;25 in at least one stage of seed development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Most of these gene models clearly peak in expression at the dry seed stage, with the highest RPKM around 700. At the five earliest stages of seed development (4 DAF through 100&#x02013;200 mg cotyledon), the highest RPKM is only about 37. This pattern of expression is repeated in Biological Replicate 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the early stages of development, the seeds are undergoing rapid growth and differentiation as discrete structures such as the embryo, seed coat, cotyledons, endosperm, and primary leaves form. This can be seen in the annotations for genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figures 1A and 1C</xref>, which peak in RPKM at early stages such as 12&#x02013;14 DAF and 5&#x02013;6 mg (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t004">Table 4</xref>). Almost two-thirds of the gene models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figure 1A</xref> are annotated as histones, proteins around which DNA is wound for compact storage in cells. The large number of histone genes showing high expression in the young seed stages may reflect the rapid expansion in cell number at this point in development, as new histones are produced to organize the DNA strands into nucleosomes. Histones are highly over-represented in this cluster, as a keyword search of the annotations (NCBI non-redundant database and PFAM) for 78,773 soybean gene models reveals &#x0003c;1% described as encoding histones.</p><p>Likewise, about 30% of the genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figure 1C</xref> are annotated as proline-rich proteins, which are involved in cell wall structure in plants. The high expression of these genes in early stages may be due to increased cell growth and development at this time. This annotation is also highly over-represented in this cluster, with &#x0003c;1% of the 78,773 soybean gene models described as encoding proline-rich proteins. Other studies have shown soybean proline-rich protein gene <italic>PRP1</italic> to be highly expressed in developing seed coats up to 50 mg fresh weight <xref rid="pone.0059270-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-Lindstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Intriguingly, other gene models with high RPKM at these early stages are annotated as senescence-associated. For example, the genes with this annotation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figure 1C</xref> were found to have extremely high RPKMs (&#x0003e;1000) in both the cotyledon/embryo and seed coat tissues of the 5&#x02013;6 mg stage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t005">Table 5</xref>). Senescence-associated plant genes and proteins have mainly been studied in the context of dying petals and leaves, tissues which release their nutrients to other parts of the plant and degrade as part of the plant&#x02019;s normal life cycle <xref rid="pone.0059270-Panavas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our data suggest these genes have an important role in early stages of seed development as yet unexplored, especially as &#x0003c;1% of the total number of gene models are annotated as senescence-associated.</p><p>By the later stages of seed development, the seed is focused on accumulating nutrients and synthesizing storage proteins. The RNA-Seq data reflect this, with storage protein annotations over-represented in the gene models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, which peak at the two mid-maturation cotyledon stages. For example, common annotations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t004">Table 4</xref>) among these genes are well-known seed storage proteins such as glycinin, beta-conglycinin, and sucrose-binding proteins, which are generally found at &#x0003c;1% in the genome as a whole. Similar expression patterns for these storage protein genes have been found in other studies <xref rid="pone.0059270-Meinke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059270-Asakura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A study by <xref rid="pone.0059270-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> of developing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds, starting with the very young globular stage and culminating with mature embryos and green cotyledons, also found a similar expression pattern for genes encoding oleosins and seed storage proteins.</p><p>Previous work done by our lab <xref rid="pone.0059270-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> using cDNA microarrays with the same older stages of development found that genes in the auxin down-related (ADR) and lipoxygenase families had high expression at the 400&#x02013;500 mg cotyledon stage, in comparison to the 100&#x02013;200 mg cotyledon stage. Lipoxygenase is involved in the storage of nitrogen and the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in seeds <xref rid="pone.0059270-Stephenson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-SkrzypczakJankun1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and may also be used later in reactions during early shoot growth <xref rid="pone.0059270-IslasFlores1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Auxin down-regulated (ADR) genes represent an intriguing family first described by <xref rid="pone.0059270-Baulcombe1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> as having reduced RNA concentration following auxin treatment of soybean hypocotyls. Members of this family have since been discovered to be highly expressed in soybean somatic embryos <xref rid="pone.0059270-ThibaudNissen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and soybean cotyledons both immature <xref rid="pone.0059270-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and post-germination <xref rid="pone.0059270-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Both ADR6 and lipoxygenase annotations are over-represented in this cluster, as both are found at &#x0003c;1% in the total list of 78,773 gene models.</p><p>A recent study <xref rid="pone.0059270-Asakura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> used Affymetrix microarrays to examine differentially expressed genes in stages of soybean seeds roughly corresponding to the middle stages of the current experiment, culminating in whole seeds at the stage of largest fresh weight for their cultivar. Genes with many of the same annotations, such as glycinin, beta-conglycinin, lipoxygenase, and oleosin, were found to peak in expression at the stage of largest fresh weight, coincident with our results. Interestingly, they also detected a number of genes annotated as seed maturation protein, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein, and dehydrin with this same expression pattern; in our study such genes peaked in expression at the final, dry seed stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), which <xref rid="pone.0059270-Asakura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> did not examine.</p><p>Seed storage proteins such as glycinin and omega-6-fatty acid desaturase are of great agronomic importance and have been well-studied in soybean. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, gene models annotated as glycinin and beta-conglycinin peak in RPKM at 400&#x02013;500 mg cotyledon and 100&#x02013;200 mg cotyledon, respectively. Other studies <xref rid="pone.0059270-Meinke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059270-Asakura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> have found that mRNAs encoding these two major soybean storage proteins show the same pattern of low expression at early stages, followed by beta-conglycinin increasing in expression before glycinin, with a dramatic decrease for both at the mature, dry seed stage.</p><p>In contrast, most of the gene models annotated as fatty acid desaturase show steady expression throughout multiple stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Genes annotated as omega-6 desaturase were found to have a similar expression pattern in equivalent soybean seed stages <xref rid="pone.0059270-Asakura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, with a peak at the stage of largest fresh weight. Both omega-6 and omega-3-fatty acid desaturase are involved in the conversion of oil in the soybean seed to more highly desaturated forms throughout development.</p><p>At the final stage of development, the seed is undergoing desiccation in preparation for a quiescent period prior to imbibition and germination. Almost all of the highly-expressed gene models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g001">Figure 1G</xref> are annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions in plants. The late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins (of which dehydrins are a subfamily) are known to accumulate both in the desiccating stage of seed development as well as in vegetative tissues experiencing environmentally-induced water loss <xref rid="pone.0059270-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-GarayArroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These proteins may protect cellular structures in a variety of ways, such as by stabilizing cell membranes, quarantining ions that have been concentrated by water loss, or binding the remaining available water <xref rid="pone.0059270-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. LEA genes with a similar expression pattern were found in developing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds, peaking in expression at the mature embryo stage <xref rid="pone.0059270-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The LEA and dehydrin annotations are over-represented in this cluster, as they are found in &#x0003c;1% of annotations in the 78,773 gene models total.</p><p>Transcription factors are crucial components of regulation systems which may initiate vital gene expression changes while displaying relatively low expression themselves. Thus when examining transcription factor gene models in this RNA-Seq data, an RPKM cut-off of just 25 was chosen. The wide variety of transcription factor families found to be highly expressed in our data reflects the complex network of regulation required during seed development, especially at the younger stages when seeds are undergoing a diverse array of morphological changes.</p><p>The transcription factor gene models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, which peak at 22&#x02013;24 DAF, have many annotations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t006">Table 6</xref>) which have also been found to be significantly expressed in developing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds with a similar pattern that peaks in early to middle development; such annotations include zinc finger proteins, GATA-binding factors, MYB domains, and members of the APETALA2-ethylene response factor family (AP2/ERF) <xref rid="pone.0059270-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. MYB domain transcription factor <italic>AtMYB123,</italic> also known as <italic>TRANSPARENT TESTA2</italic>, is known to be involved in the regulation of proanthocyanidin production in developing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seed coats <xref rid="pone.0059270-Nesi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-Appelhagen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. AUX/IAA family genes and auxin response factors, similar to those also found in this cluster, interact with the hormone auxin to regulate genes involved in the proper development of young embryos and cotyledons <xref rid="pone.0059270-Jenik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Recently, certain MYB transcription factors as well as auxin response factors have been identified as the targets of microRNAs in multiple mature cotyledon stages of the soybean cultivar Williams (the same used in the present experiment), suggesting a mechanism by which some of these genes are down-regulated after a peak in expression at the early seed stages <xref rid="pone.0059270-Shamimuzzaman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Small RNA profiles, including miRNAs for soybean, are available for certain stages of seed coat and cotyledon development <xref rid="pone.0059270-Tuteja1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-Zabala1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A keyword search was used to determine approximately what percentage of the 5608 transcription factor gene models fell into each family; about 14% of this larger group were annotated as Myb-like factors, suggesting this family is not over-represented in the young seed cluster with 11.4%. However, the auxin-related transcription factors comprise only about 2% of transcription factor gene models generally, but 6.6% of the cluster highly expressed at 22&#x02013;24 DAF. Other families mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t006">Table 6</xref> which are over-represented in this young seed cluster include the global transcription factor group (4.8% of the cluster), the GAGA-binding protein family (3.1% of the cluster), and MADS-box transcription factors (3.1% of the cluster), each of which comprises &#x0003c;1% of the transcription factors found on the larger list.</p><p>In contrast, the transcription factor gene models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4C</xref> peak in expression at the final, dry seed stage. Previous work from our lab <xref rid="pone.0059270-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> using cDNA and oligo microarrays with these same older stages of seed development found that an unexpectedly high percentage of transcription-related genes were expressed during the dry seed stage relative to the 100&#x02013;200 mg cotyledon. The over-expressed transcription factor annotations reported included Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y), zinc fingers, and AP2, which also appear on the current RNA-Seq list of highly expressed transcription factors at the dry seed stage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t006">Table 6</xref>). Some of these factors could be involved in preparing transcripts in the dry seed in anticipation of germination, decreasing the time and effort needed to produce essential proteins once imbibition begins. A study by <xref rid="pone.0059270-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> of developing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds also using microarray data noted that <italic>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 5</italic> (<italic>ABI5</italic>), a bZIP transcription factor, displayed a similar expression profile to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and is known to regulate certain LEA genes, which also have this expression profile in both studies. Additionally, both NF-Y transcription factors and AP2/ERF family members have been implicated in drought responses in plants, suggesting a role they may play in desiccating seeds <xref rid="pone.0059270-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059270-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. According to the keyword classification of the list of 5608 transcription factor gene models, many of the annotations mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059270-t006">Table 6</xref> which peak in expression at the dry seed stage are over-represented in this cluster. For example, AP2/ethylene responsive transcription factors and the CBF/NF-Y family comprise 19.4% and 10.2% of this cluster, respectively, but &#x0003c;10% and &#x0003c;5% of the larger list. The no apical meristem (NAM/NAC) family is found at 9.3% in the cluster compared to &#x0003c;4% overall, and heat shock transcription factors are found at 3.7% in the cluster versus &#x0003c;2% overall.</p><p>It was noted that some transcription factor families, such as the AP2/ethylene responsive factors, have a variety of expression patterns throughout seed development, as different members regulate genes needed at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This large family of transcription factors, which also includes the dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB) and the related to ABI3/VP1 (RAV) genes, has been linked to a similarly wide variety of biotic and abiotic stresses and hormonal signaling, as well as certain developmental processes such as floral organ identity and root morphogenesis <xref rid="pone.0059270-Dietz1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. MYB is another family in which different members are highly expressed at young stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) or dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>However, other families, such as the no apical meristem transcription factors, have a much more specific expression pattern, in this case being highly expressed at the final, dry seed stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059270-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). NAM or NAC genes (so-called due to four early transcription factors found with the same new domain&#x02013;petunia <italic>NAM</italic> plus <italic>Arabidopsis ATAF1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> and <italic>CUC2)</italic> are part of a large plant-specific family with a diverse array of functions, including biotic and abiotic stress responses, hormone signaling, leaf senescence, and meristem and primordia formation during embryogenesis <xref rid="pone.0059270-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. A large number of the NAC genes identified in soybean, including several found in this study to have high expression in the dry, mature seeds, are known to be involved in drought stress response in other tissues such as roots and shoots <xref rid="pone.0059270-Le2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This finding indicates these genes have important functions during tissue desiccation, whether brought on by environmental stress or normal developmental processes.</p><p>In this study, seven stages of soybean seeds, from just a few days after fertilization to dry, mature seeds, were subjected to next-generation sequencing, resulting in millions of sequenced transcripts per stage.

For both biological replicates, as well as 5&#x02013;6 mg separated seed coat and cotyledon, all samples had reads 75 bp in length after processing, except the 4 DAF and dry whole seed samples of Biological Replicate 2, which had reads 100 bp in length. The technical differences between the sample sequencing methods reflect improvements in the standard high-throughput RNA sequencing techniques over time. Sequencing data was filtered through the standard Illumina pipeline including the CASSAVA program.</p><p>The reads were aligned to 78,773 Glyma1 cDNA soybean gene models determined by the Soybean Genome Project, Department of Energy, Joint Genome Institute <xref rid="pone.0059270-Schmutz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, using the alignment program Bowtie <xref rid="pone.0059270-Langmead1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.
