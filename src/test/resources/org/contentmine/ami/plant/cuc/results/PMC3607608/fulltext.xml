As a result, they have evolved flexibility in their responses to changing environmental conditions, such as light, drought, temperature, the available nutritional supply and biotic invasion. Different types of biotic invasions, such as insect, bacterial, fungal and viral invasions, represent a severe threat to agricultural production worldwide <xref rid="pone.0058987-Ahuja1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Some responses of host plants to different stress conditions are very general and provide protection from a variety of invading organisms, whereas others are more specific and target particular types of attackers. Highly complex and often connected signalling pathways, regulating numerous metabolic networks, coordinate plant responses to different stress conditions. Over the last decade or so, clear advances have been made in understanding how defence responses are orchestrated in higher plants. The development of microarray technology has allowed monitoring of expressional changes in thousands of genes simultaneously, and this technology has now become a major tool for examining plant stress biology. Most of these studies have adopted <italic>A. thaliana</italic> as a model plant organism because of the vast amount of genomic information made available for this species with the completion of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome sequence and advanced annotation of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes <xref rid="pone.0058987-Koornneef1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Analysing the regulation of gene expression under various stress conditions has revealed that the early defence responses of a plant to different stress factors often overlap and engage the same sets of genes <xref rid="pone.0058987-Pitzschke1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It has also become evident that different types of plant invaders may induce substantially different changes in the host plant transcriptome. Furthermore, studies on plants subjected to various treatments indicate that the induced defences can be both general &#x02013; being commonly manifested regardless of the type of applied treatment; and specific &#x02013; providing protection from a certain type of stress <xref rid="pone.0058987-Reymond1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Kreps1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In many cases, however, the multidimensional level of network crosstalk makes it challenging to recognise which of the observed responses are general and which are more stress specific <xref rid="pone.0058987-Dicke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Knight1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Aphids are one of the world&#x02019;s major insect pests, causing serious economic damage to a range of temperate and tropical crops <xref rid="pone.0058987-VanEmden1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Aphids use their mouthparts, formed into a stylet-like structure, to pierce plant tissue in the search for sieve elements (SEs) containing their primary food source: phloem sap <xref rid="pone.0058987-Goggin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Broekgaarden1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Feeding by an aphid causes minimal wounding, as its stylet proceeds mostly intercellulary and is inserted only into selected cells on its way to the phloem tissue <xref rid="pone.0058987-Spiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the disruption of cell walls and membranes of the pierced cells is likely to be the first factor triggering a plant response. In addition, the salivary secretions lubricating the stylet throughout its pathway through plants tissues and injected into SEs during feeding contain molecular signatures that activate plant defences. Therefore, despite their stealthy feeding, aphids are strong inducers of plant defences against them. Recently Ku&#x0015b;nierczyk <italic>et al.</italic> reported the timing and dynamics of early <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> defence responses <xref rid="pone.0058987-Kusnierczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> to an aphid attack.</p><p>
<italic>P. syringae</italic> is a bacterial leaf pathogen that causes extensive chlorosis and necrotic spots <xref rid="pone.0058987-Whalen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Many strains of <italic>P. syringae</italic> are pathogenic in the model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and <italic>P. syringae</italic> is therefore widely used to study plant &#x02013; pathogen interactions under laboratory conditions. <italic>P. syringae</italic> enters host tissues through wounds or natural openings such as stomata, and in susceptible plants, it multiplies to high concentrations in intercellular spaces <xref rid="pone.0058987-FumiakiKatagiri1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The ability of <italic>P. syringae</italic> to multiply endophytically is dependent on its type III secretion pathway enabling the secretion of proteins into the apoplast. These proteins interact with the cell wall and plasma membrane and are directly translocated into the cytoplasm of host cells <xref rid="pone.0058987-Preston1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Several strains of <italic>P. syringae</italic> produce coronatine, a molecule that mimics endogenous plant jasmonyl-L-isoleucine and an activator of the jasmonic acid signalling pathway <xref rid="pone.0058987-Weiler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. By doing so, the bacteria manipulate host responses, suppressing salicylic acid defences through the activation of jasmonic acid signalling <xref rid="pone.0058987-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Melotto1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>A great number of experiments conducted to assess plant responses to different stresses have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the induced defences of plants. However, the comparison of independent experiments and extraction of meaningful information from such comparisons is complicated and difficult in most cases, mainly due to the lack of common standards regarding how to grow plants, conduct expression profile experiments, and finally, how to evaluate the resulting gene expression data <xref rid="pone.0058987-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In recent years, integrated approaches, such as systems biology methods, have been evolving, providing promising tools for studying plant stress responses <xref rid="pone.0058987-Cramer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-KonikaChawla1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Scientists intend to go beyond simple functional enrichment analyses to understand the molecular basis of genome-scale microarray experiments. Methods inspired by systems biology utilise lists of differentially expressed genes ranked by biological criteria to search for the distribution of blocks of functionally related genes without imposing any artificial threshold. Such ranked lists of genes can be arranged into functional classes, pathways and biological processes. Co-expression or co-regulation of particular genes can indicate their involvement in similar biological processes, meaning that individual modules of genes can be attributed to specific biological processes. Using this basic concept, modular network topology-based analysis has been proven to be useful in identifying functional modules of genes <xref rid="pone.0058987-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In a recent co-expression study, Weston and co-workers showed how a co-expression network-based analysis can be used for understanding population-level adaptive physiological responses of plants to abiotic stress <xref rid="pone.0058987-Weston1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>MicroRNAs (microRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation and stress-inducible transcriptional regulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0058987-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In plants, mature microRNAs pair with complementary sites on mRNAs, subsequently leading to the cleavage and degradation of the mRNAs. Many microRNAs target mRNAs that encode transcription factors and, thus, influence the expression of many genes whose regulation is controlled by these transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0058987-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The identification, detection, regulation and functional analysis of microRNAs associated with biotic stress remains a great challenge. In contrast, information about plant stress-responsive genes and their transcription factor binding sites is available to some extent in several databases <xref rid="pone.0058987-Davuluri1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Bulow1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Bulow2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Higo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Katari1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Integration of such publicly available knowledge bases with experimental approaches would provide useful insights in understanding the plant defence responses to different biotic stresses.</p><p>In this manuscript, we present such an integrated approach to explore the common (general) and attacker-specific defence responses of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> subjected to two different types of biotic invaders: phloem-feeding aphids (<italic>B. brassicae</italic>) and pathogenic bacteria (<italic>P. syringae</italic>). To allow comparison between the obtained gene expression profiles and the observed regulation of gene pathways involved in defence against the aphid and the bacterium, the same growth and experimental conditions were used in the two simultaneous experimental setups. Transcriptional changes resulting either from infestation with <italic>B. brassicae</italic> or infection with <italic>P. syringae</italic> were assessed with the use of full-genome Arabidopsis microarrays (the data have been deposited in GEO with accession numbers GSE39245 and GSE39246).</p><p>Two sets of differentially expressed genes, corresponding to the plant responses to either aphid or bacterial treatment, were created as the outcome of the microarray data analysis. In an attempt to integrate the resulting data with publicly available knowledge extracted from several different databases as well as from published results of other experiments, these two differentially regulated gene sets were subsequently analysed through a set of computational approaches. The following analyses were incorporated into the presented work: an analysis of enriched functional categories or processes; exploration of potential connections between microRNAs and biotic stress-inducible transcriptional regulation during insect and bacterial attack; cross-validation of the aphid- and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-regulated genes using a co-expression network constructed from a compendium of 69 other biotic stress microarray datasets complied in the CORNET tool <xref rid="pone.0058987-DeBodt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cornet.psb.ugent.be/">https://cornet.psb.ugent.be/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overall Changes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Transcriptome in Response to Insect and Bacterial Attack</title><p>To explore the complexity of the transcriptional changes induced by the different examined <italic>A. thaliana</italic> attackers, we compared the overlap between the obtained gene sets.

Genes related to these processes showed clear down-regulation following <italic>P. syringae</italic> treatment. Secondary metabolism was strongly affected during both treatments, particularly regarding the phenylpropanoid and glucosinolate pathways. The results of <italic>P. syringae</italic> treatment also showed that genes connected to the terpenoid and alkaloid pathways were up-regulated, including <italic>DXPS1, TPS10, GES/TPS04, SS2, SQE6</italic> and <italic>LAS1</italic>. In general, the stress associated with the activation and continuation of defence responses is metabolically expensive, and the plant must reallocate a significant amount of the resources that would normally be used in plant growth and reproduction to the production of defence-related compounds <xref rid="pone.0058987-Theis1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Strauss1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, in a recent work, Foyer et al. <xref rid="pone.0058987-Foyer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> explained that the decreases in growth and photosynthesis in response to stress are more likely the result of programmed down-regulation. Our experimental results showed that exposure to two biotic stresses resulted in the down-regulation of genes linked to auxin, gibberelin and cytokinin responses as well as genes coupled to cell wall modifications and cell division. The infected plants might also compensate for the depletion of sugars and amino acids, resulting in increased carbon assimilation and mobilisation of carbon, mannitol and nitrogen reserves. The plants may have degraded proteins/amino acids to generate energy (glycolysis) and re-assimilate nitrogen, through the glutamate dehydrogenase <italic>GDH2</italic> or lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (At<underline>4g</underline>33150). There were also genes connected to starch degradation/sugar responses induced, indicating that the plants might be degrading starches, e.g., <italic>BAM5</italic> and <italic>GPT2</italic>, used in glycolysis. Starch biosynthesis genes were generally down-regulated. The degradation of starch and maltose may also generate an osmotic force that balances water losses. During an aphid infestation, plants suffer from osmotic stress as the insect sucks large quantities of liquids from them. To counteract this situation, the transcription of genes involved in the regulation of water balance was observed to be induced, such as the <italic>WRKY40</italic>, <italic>CYP707A3</italic> (ABA-biosynthesis), <italic>ZAT10</italic> and <italic>ZAT7.</italic>

First, individual genes belonging to the common category were grouped into a &#x0201c;super node&#x0201d; based on shared functional properties, such as GO terms, KEGG pathways, Gene families and even similar annotations. The functional annotations were categorised in a hierarchical manner, where the functional terms and pathways were themselves grouped into higher, more generic categories (details are given in the Materials and Methods). During this analysis, we used post-transcriptional regulation, protein-protein interactions, and transcriptional regulation information from both experimental and predicted databases. The &#x02018;Regulated Edges&#x02019; are predicted interactions based on the presence of known transcription factor cis-acting binding sites located in the 3 kbp upstream region of annotated transcripts. Interestingly, some of the key stress-regulated transcription factors are reported in publications, or have been computationally predicted to be regulated by different microRNAs. Thus, we were able to hypothesise that the activation of microRNA genes under biotic stresses would lead to the repression of many downstream protein-coding genes and affect physiological responses.

Most of these transcription factors have shown to be involved in stress responses and regulatory processes. Some <italic>WRKY</italic> and <italic>bZIP</italic> genes were expressed differentially only during the aphid experiment, whereas some <italic>MYB</italic> genes were expressed differentially only during <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection. A Gene Ontology-based overrepresentation analysis revealed that half of the genes from the common list were involved in central metabolic and cellular processes, such as electron transport and energy pathways localised to the plastid. Secondary metabolism was strongly affected during both treatments, particularly the phenylpropanoid and glucosinolate pathways. Processes connected to the chloroplast, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, carotenoid production, chlorophyll biosynthesis, carbon fixation and others were down-regulated following <italic>P. syringae</italic> treatment. Starch biosynthesis genes were generally down-regulated, and an indication was found that the plants were degrading starch, which could help the plants to maintain the osmotic balance. Components of the ethylene, JA, SA, ABA, auxin and brassinosteroid pathways appeared to be specifically regulated during the aphid and <italic>P. syringae</italic> treatments. Ethylene responses were clearly induced during aphid feeding, while JA was more strongly induced by <italic>Pseudomonas.</italic> The number of signalling proteins that were differentially expressed during the aphid experiment was more than four times higher compared to the <italic>P. syringae</italic> treatment. By integrating secondary information from most available public sources, we further explored the regulatory links between biotic stress and microRNAs associated with aphid-and <italic>P. syringae</italic> -specific differentially regulated processes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and the corresponding genes are briefly summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058987-t010">

The eluted RNA was concentrated to 10&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;l using a 30 kDa cut-off Microcon spin filter unit (Amicon, Bedford, USA). To protect the RNA from degradation, the RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, USA) was added to a final concentration of 1 unit &#x000b5;l-1. The purity and quantity of the obtained RNA was determined using a Nanodrop ND 1000 instrument (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Within-array replicated measurements for the same gene were merged by taking the average over the replicates. The data were then scaled so that all array datasets presented the same median absolute deviation. Genes showing dye-biased responses due to Cy5 and Cy3 labelling were identified and excluded. During data processing, we focused on genes for which at least 3 out of 4 biological replicates for the examined time points passed the quality control criteria suggested by J&#x000f8;rstad et al. <xref rid="pone.0058987-Jorstad1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058987-Jorstad2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. To make statistical inferences about differentially regulated genes, the Limma package <xref rid="pone.0058987-Smyth1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> was used. The Limma approach is based on fitting a linear model to the expression data from each probe on a microarray. Genes showing an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were considered to be significantly differentially expressed. All of the genes discussed in this paper were found to be significantly differentially expressed in one of the two treatments (aphid or <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>GO Enrichment Analysis of Common Genes</title><p>We employed a simple set theory-based operation in R to find common and specific transcriptional responses that occurred in both experiments. To conduct automated GO <xref rid="pone.0058987-Ashburner1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, TAIR <xref rid="pone.0058987-Lamesch1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref> annotations, we simultaneously used three programs: ClueGO <xref rid="pone.0058987-Bindea1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, BiNGO <xref rid="pone.0058987-Maere1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> and <italic>VirtualPlant</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0058987-Tardieu1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Only the ClueGO results were included in this manuscript. Transcription factors were classified according to the &#x02018;The Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0058987-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In ClueGO, to calculate enrichment values for terms and groups, we used two-sided (enrichment/depletion) tests based on the hypergeometric distribution to calculate doubling for two-sided tests to address discreetness and conservatism effects, as suggested by Rivals et al. <xref rid="pone.0058987-Rivals1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. To correct the P-values for multiple testing, the Bonferroni method was used to control the type I error (false positive) rate <xref rid="pone.0058987-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. ClueGO employs a new kappa statistic. To link the terms in the network, ClueGO first creates a binary gene-term matrix with the selected terms and their associated genes. Based on this matrix, a term&#x02013;term similarity matrix is calculated using chance-corrected kappa statistics to determine the strength of the associations between the terms. Because the term&#x02013;term matrix is of categorical origin, using a kappa statistic was found to be the most suitable method. Finally, the created network represents the terms as nodes, which are linked based on a predefined kappa score level. The kappa score threshold can initially be adjusted on a positive scale from 0 to 1 to restrict the network connectivity in a customised way. In our analysis, we used a kappaScore threshold of 0.3. The size of the nodes reflects the enrichment significance of the terms. The functional groups represented by their most significant (leading) term are visualised in the network, providing an insightful view of their interrelationships. Furthermore, other ways of selecting the group-leading term, e.g., based on the number or percentage of genes per term, are also provided.</p><p>
<italic>VirtualPlant</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0058987-Tardieu1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref> integrates genome-wide data regarding the known and predicted relationships among genes, proteins, and molecules as well as genome-scale experimental measurements. This warehouse includes descriptions of molecular entities (e.g., gene annotations and functional classifications), molecular interactions (metabolic associations, regulatory interactions, and other interaction data from public databases), and publicly available microarray data (including more than 1,800 gene chip hybridisations from the ATH1 Affymetrix platform obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Center [NASC] using the Affywatch subscription service). VirtualPlant also provides visualisation techniques that render multivariate information in visual formats that facilitate the extraction of biological concepts.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Co-expression Analysis of Common Genes using CORNET</title><p>The construction of co-expression networks for multiple input genes was conducted using the CORNET tool <xref rid="pone.0058987-DeBodt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The co-expression tool calculates the correlation between gene expression profiles using one or more precompiled expression datasets and, as such, identifies possible functional associations between genes. Out of all of the available expression data, we selected the subgroup consisting of 69 ATH1 AtGenExpress biotic stress compendium expression data. All the expression data were processed using RMA from the R BioConductor package and making use of the CDF described in Casneuf et al. <xref rid="pone.0058987-Casneuf1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients were calculated between the given genes. Correlation coefficients higher and lower than a certain value are reported. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (PCC) was used at a cut off &#x02265;0.7. Networks and associated evidence were visualised in Cytoscape 2.7.0.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Gene Networks, microRNAs and Connections to Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation</title><p>The <italic>Gene networks</italic> tool in <italic>VirtualPlant</italic> groups individual genes into a supernode based on shared functional properties, such as GO terms, KEGG pathways, gene families and even similar annotations. Edges were drawn between two supernodes when at least one gene or gene product in each supernode showed a molecular interaction. To improve the regulatory interaction predictions, we filtered the transcription factor:target gene predictions to include only the transcription factor and target pairs whose expression values were correlated in the microarray experiment <xref rid="pone.0058987-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. The selected statistic for the calculation of correlations in this analysis was the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient, with a cut-off value of less than or equal to 0.7. The results were then cross-compared with all of the microRNA genes curated in the microRNA Registry (microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences) <xref rid="pone.0058987-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref> and in the Arabidopsis Small RNA Project (ASRP) Database <xref rid="pone.0058987-Backman1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>.
