We conclude that, despite the evolutionary gulf between them, <italic>HsAGO2</italic> is likely capable of interacting with some component/s of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miRNA pathway, thereby perturbing its operation, although differences have arisen such that HsAGO2 alone is insufficient to confer efficient silencing of miRNA targets <italic>in planta</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HsAGO2</kwd><kwd>AtAGO1</kwd><kwd><italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic></kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5282"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs (sRNAs) that direct the sequence-specific silencing of mRNA transcripts, providing a critical layer of gene regulation in both plants and animals (Pasquinelli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2012</xref>). Much of the molecular machinery that oversees miRNA biogenesis and activity is shared between these kingdoms and, hence, must have arisen prior to their divergence, though it is unclear whether a basal miRNA pathway was already in operation at this time (Axtell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2011</xref>). From this shared origin, the plant and animal miRNA pathways have followed divergent evolutionary courses and there now exists characteristic distinctions in the manner of their operation. Briefly, plant miRNAs generally silence only a small handful of targets, requiring near-perfect complementarity for their recognition, and do so via a combination of transcript cleavage and a non-cleavage mechanism/s (Brodersen and Voinnet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2009</xref>). In contrast, animal miRNAs regulate target transcripts to which they are only partially complementary, generally recognizing many targets and silencing these via a non-cleavage mechanism/s (Axtell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2011</xref>; Huntzinger and Izaurralde, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2011</xref>). The question of how the apparently similar set of components in the miRNA pathways of plants and animals has been modified so as to generate these functional differences is keenly relevant to our understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation.</p><p>The best example of shared componentry between the systems, an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein is required, without known exception, for miRNA-mediated gene silencing (Mallory and Vaucheret, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2010</xref>). Considered the core component of the miRNA induced silencing complex (miRISC), AGO's involvement in miRNA-mediated silencing appears threefold. First, it facilitates the interaction of a miRNA with its intended targets (Nakanishi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2012</xref>; Schirle and Macrae, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2012</xref>). Second, when sufficient complementarity exists, it provides the catalytic activity for cleavage of the target mRNA (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2004</xref>; Meister et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Baumberger and Baulcombe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2005</xref>; Rivas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). Finally, it orchestrates the silencing of un-cleaved targets by recruiting the factors responsible for their translational repression and accelerated degradation (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2011</xref>).</p><p>Plants and animals each exhibit a diversity of AGO proteins. There are, for example, 10 members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which are distinguished by the class of sRNAs that they associate with and by their patterns of expression (Vaucheret, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2008</xref>; Mallory and Vaucheret, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2010</xref>). Of these, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana AGO1</italic> (<italic>AtAGO1</italic>) has the most prominent involvement in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Emphasizing the importance of its role, <italic>AtAGO1</italic> homeostasis must be delicately maintained by a feedback mechanism in which miR168 directs the <italic>AtAGO1</italic>-dependent silencing of <italic>AtAGO1</italic> expression. When this circuit is disturbed via the mutation of <italic>AtAGO1</italic>'s miR168 target site, the over-accumulation of AtAGO1 protein leads&#x02014;somewhat counter intuitively&#x02014;to a general perturbation of miRNA-mediated regulation in the plant, manifesting in pleiotropic defects that resemble those apparent in a range of miRNA-pathway loss-of-function alleles (Morel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2002</xref>; Vaucheret et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>; Vazquez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2004</xref>).</p><p>Of four mammalian AGOs, <italic>Homo sapiens AGO2</italic> (<italic>HsAGO2</italic>) has the best-characterized role in the miRNA pathway. Although HsAGO2 and AtAGO1 share only 43% amino acid identity (Poulsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2013</xref>), they appear similar in function. Both preferentially associate with sRNAs bearing a 5&#x02032;U (Mi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2008</xref>; Frank et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2010</xref>) and may catalyze the cleavage of complementary mRNA transcripts <italic>in vitro</italic> without the participation of any other component (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2004</xref>; Meister et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Baumberger and Baulcombe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2005</xref>; Rivas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). Moreover, they interact and operate in conjunction with proteins of analogous structure and function. For example, HsAGO2 facilitates the non-cleavage silencing of targets (Pillai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2004</xref>) in a process dependent on the GW182 family proteins (Takimoto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>; Zipprich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2009</xref>), while AtAGO1 (Brodersen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2008</xref>; Lanet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2009</xref>) and an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GW protein SUO (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2012</xref>) each have a demonstrated involvement in miRNA-mediated translational repression. The plant de-capping factor VARCIOSE (VCS) (Brodersen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2008</xref>) and its animal ortholog Ge-1 (Eulalio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2007</xref>) have also been implicated in translational repression. Further to this, the loading of miRNAs into AtAGO1 and HsAGO2 is supported by chaperones that are conserved between the two kingdoms (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2009</xref>; Iki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2012</xref>; Iwasaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2010</xref>; Earley and Poethig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2011</xref>).</p><p>The array of similarities just outlined indicates that, despite the evolutionary distance between them, <italic>AtAGO1</italic> and <italic>HsAGO2</italic> share a remarkable degree of functional conservation. Indeed, in their recent report, Poulsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2013</xref>) integrated information from mutational studies of <italic>AtAGO1</italic> with structural studies of HsAGO2 to make general inferences about the mechanics of AGO activity, the underlying assumption being that these two proteins are highly similar in form and function. By expressing <italic>HsAGO2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we sought to determine whether they might be so similar that HsAGO2 could function as a component of the plant miRNA pathway or whether distinctions that have accumulated during their parallel evolution would become apparent when expressed in an identical cellular context, perhaps providing insight into the characteristic operational differences of the plant and animal miRNA pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds were surface sterilized by exposure (3&#x02013;6 h) to the chlorine gas generated by mixing 100 mL of sodium hypochlorite with 3 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a sealed desiccator jar.

Since over-expression of endogenous <italic>AtAGO1</italic>, elicited by the mutation of its miR168 target site, leads to a miRNA-pathway loss-of-function effect (Vaucheret et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>), the excessive expression of <italic>HsAGO2</italic>, unregulated by any homeostatic mechanism, might perturb miRNA activity in a similar fashion. To test this, we wished to directly compare <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic> plants to transgenic plants over-expressing <italic>AtAGO1</italic>. To generate these, a cDNA for <italic>AtAGO1</italic> was placed under a double 35S promoter (<italic>35S:AtAGO1</italic>) and, in a separate construct (35S:<italic>4mAGO1</italic>), four silent mutations identical to those described by Vaucheret et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>) were created, introducing four mismatches to <italic>AtAGO1</italic>'<italic>s</italic> miR168 target site, which should render it resistant to miR168-mediated regulation. Both constructs were transformed into wild type plants and their primary transformants were grown alongside <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic> plants. Populations of transformants for all three constructs were morphologically indistinguishable, each eliciting phenotypes characterized by serration and broad, flattened leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These abnormal phenotypes were associated with elevated <italic>AtAGO1</italic> mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), ruling out co-suppression of the endogenous gene as an alternative explanation.

MiR159a and miR166 levels were decreased in transformants displaying an obvious aberrant phenotype, though these decreases were not always found to be statistically significant compared to wild type (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Since miRNA levels were also lower in <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> than in wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), this result is consistent with the notion that the three constructs behave as miRNA-pathway loss-of-function alleles. The decreased accumulation of mature miRNAs could not be explained by changes at the transcriptional level, since parallel decreases in pri-miRNA abundances were not observed (data not included).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>miRNA abundances decrease in AGO overexpressing plants.</bold> The abundances of miR159a and miR166 were measured in total RNA from sample pools composed of 4&#x02013;8 transformants, 24-days old, from each morphological category for each construct.

With the anticipation that a functional HsAGO2 protein might alleviate an <italic>ago1</italic> loss-of-function allele, the <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic> construct was transformed into <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic>, as were <italic>35S:AtAGO1</italic> and <italic>35S:4mAGO1</italic>. Both <italic>AtAGO1</italic> constructs were able to complement the <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> morphological phenotype, yielding transformants resembling wild type plants with similar frequencies.

This implies that, although both constructs can inhibit miRNA activity in a wild type background, they are also able to fully or partially restore AGO1 activity in the <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> mutant background. By contrast, none of the 68 transformants for <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic> showed even partial phenotypic complementation, with the majority exhibiting an even more severely aberrant phenotype than <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This result argues that, whilst HsAGO2 behaves just like AtAGO1 in an over-expression context, the human protein, unlike its plant counterpart, is seemingly incapable of facilitating the efficient silencing of miRNA targets in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>HsAGO2</italic> cannot complement the <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> mutation.</bold> 22-day old transformants of <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic>, <italic>35S:AtAGO1</italic>, and <italic>35S:4mAGO1</italic> in the <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> background were categorized based on their morphologies as being non-complemented (resembling <italic>ago1&#x02013;27)</italic>, partially complemented (intermediate phenotype) or fully complemented (resembling wild type).

The best-studied AGO proteins of each kingdom, AtAGO1 and HsAGO2 are believed to share a high degree of functional conservation. Seeking to determine the full extent of their similarity, we constitutively expressed <italic>HsAGO2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic> transformants displayed abnormal phenotypes indistinguishable from those of transgenic plants over-expressing <italic>AtAGO1</italic>, with both groups resembling miRNA-pathway loss-of-function alleles at the morphological and molecular levels and exhibiting similar decreases in the abundances of mature miRNAs. We are aware of no other attempt to express a component of the animal miRNA pathway <italic>in planta</italic>, or vice versa, and our results indicate that, despite the evolutionary gulf between the two systems, the HsAGO2 protein retains the ability to interact with some component/s of the plant miRNA pathway and behaves similarly to AtAGO1 in an over-expression context.</p><p>Whilst <italic>HsAGO2</italic> behaves just like <italic>AtAGO1</italic> in an over-expression context, it was unable to rescue the <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> allele, indicating that it is insufficient for the efficient silencing of miRNA targets in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This is unsurprising, given that even the closest homologue of <italic>AtAGO1</italic>, <italic>AtAGO10</italic>&#x02014;with which it shares 75% amino acid identity compared to just 43% for <italic>HsAGO2</italic> (Poulsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2013</xref>)&#x02014;expressed from <italic>AtAGO1</italic>'s promoter, is unable to rescue the same allele (Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2011</xref>). In fact, ectopic expression of <italic>AtAGO10</italic> from the <italic>AtAGO1</italic> promoter yielded upward leaf-curl and exacerbated the <italic>ago1&#x02013;27</italic> allele (Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2011</xref>), just as we observed for the <italic>35S:HsAGO2</italic> construct. While AtAGO10 associates with miRNAs and is capable of cleaving target transcripts <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is not an efficient gene-silencer <italic>in vivo</italic> and instead attenuates AtAGO1-associated miRNA activity by sequestering miRNAs, having a particular preference for miR165/166 (Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2011</xref>). The HsAGO2 protein is also sufficient for sRNA-directed mRNA cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2004</xref>; Meister et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Rivas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>) but apparently fails to efficiently silence miRNA targets <italic>in planta</italic>. It seems therefore that a basal cleavage activity, demonstrable <italic>in vitro</italic>, is not sufficient for proper miRNA-mediated gene silencing <italic>in planta.</italic> Consequently, we suggest that the AtAGO1 protein is distinguished by some specialization, perhaps allowing it to interact with an unknown factor/s that is additionally required for efficient silencing, which is essential for its function. The requirement for an additional factor/s could explain the somewhat counterintuitive observation that <italic>AtAGO1</italic> over-expression generates a miRNA-pathway loss-of-function effect; an excess of AtAGO1 protein might titrate miRNAs and other necessary components of the miRISC into separate, incomplete complexes, each unable to facilitate miRNA-guided gene silencing, thereby inhibiting endogenous miRNA activity. Such an explanation was proposed by Vaucheret et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>), who first reported a perturbation of miRNA activity by <italic>AtAGO1</italic> over-expression. Here it must be noted that Vaucheret et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>) reported modest increases in the accumulation of mature miR159a and miR166 in transgenic plants over-expressing <italic>AtAGO1</italic>, the opposite result to what we observed. The foundation of this contradiction might lie in the fact that the two studies employed different protocols for the extraction of total RNA from plant tissues, although this explanation cannot be substantiated here. That both the <italic>AtAGO1</italic> and the <italic>4mAGO1</italic> transgenes were, in the present study, expressed from a constitutive double 35S promoter in, as opposed to the endogenous promoter of <italic>AtAGO1</italic> (Vaucheret et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>), is another point of difference between the two approaches, and may have contributed to their divergent outcomes.</p><p>The miRNA pathways of plants and animals utilize similar molecular machinery but exhibit characteristic distinctions in the manner of their operation, presumably the manifestation of componential modifications that have accumulated throughout their parallel evolutionary histories. The most important of these is the differential requirements for target recognition in each, animal miRNAs commonly regulating targets that would be ignored in plants for their insufficient complementarity (Axtell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2011</xref>). Given the intimacy of their involvement in miRNA-mediated gene silencing, one could reasonably speculate that some intrinsic difference in the AGO proteins of plants and animals might underpin their differential target specificities. Because HsAGO2 was apparently unable to efficiently silence miRNA targets <italic>in planta</italic>, we were unable to address the possibility that an animal and a plant AGO might regulate distinct sets of targets when expressed in an identical cellular context. However, it was recently reported that cleavage-impaired <italic>AtAGO1</italic> mutants, which are defective in gene silencing activity, successfully co-precipitate with both miRNAs and mRNAs, suggesting that their ability to recognize and bind to target transcripts remains intact (Carbonell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2012</xref>). Thus, an avenue for future work will be to attempt to elucidate the target profile of HsAGO2 <italic>in planta</italic> via co-precipitation experiments, potentially revealing differential specificities for an animal and plant AGO.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by the Australian Research Council Discovery grant DP11013493.
