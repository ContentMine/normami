<italic>Pistacia chinensis</italic> is a strict dioecious plant with male and female flowers in individuals. In China, <italic>P. chinensis</italic> is widely planted for biodiesel oil due to high oil content in seeds. In practice it requires to grow more female plants for biodiesel production. At present, there are still no reliable methods for sex determination during the long juvenile stage of this species. In order to develop protein molecular markers for sex determination in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>, proteomic approach was used to identify differentially expressed proteins between male and female plants. Vegetative organs (leaf and stem) rather than reproductive organs/tissues were used for protein extraction so as to develop protein markers which can be used in siblings before flowering. Protein was extracted using a phenol-based protocol. By using two-dimensional electrophoresis, a total of 10 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed in leaf and stem between both sexes, of which 7 were successfully identified by mass spectrometry and matched to 6 functional proteins such as NB-ARC domain containing protein, light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein, asorbate peroxidase (APX), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2, temperature-induced lipocalin (TIL) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). The sex-related difference displayed in a tissue-specific way, especially in stem. PGK existed in high abundance in stem phloem in the female, but was almost not detected in the male; APX and two TIL species were highly abundant in the stem of male plants, while their abundance was much lower in female plants. Moreover, these abundance differences were further confirmed in individual plants. Hence, it is assumed that APX, PGK and TIL might be promising candidates to serve as protein molecular markers for sex determination in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. Our results form the basis for a further understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of sex determination in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The great majority of flowering plants are hermaphrodite, having flowers with both male and female parts.

However, primary sex determining genes have not yet been identified in any dioecious plant species to date.</p><p>Chinese pistache tree (<italic>Pistacia chinensis</italic> Bunge), native to East Asia (especially China), is a strict dioecious species in the cashew family.

In China, <italic>P. chinensis</italic> is widely planted for biodiesel oil because of high seed oil content (35&#x02013;50%) <xref rid="pone.0064276-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, female plants of <italic>P. chinensis</italic> have higher economic values than male plants. In practice it is required to grow more female plants for biodiesel production. Nursery-grown <italic>P. chinensis</italic> plants first flower at 6&#x02013;10 year-age and at present there are no reliable methods for sex determination in this plant species prior to flowering. In addition, sex determination mechanisms in <italic>P. chinensis</italic> are still unknown.</p><p>As a powerful tool for protein identification and functional characterization, proteomics techniques have been widely used in plant biology.

<italic>Pistacia chinensis</italic> is a deciduous, wind-pollinated, large shrub or small tree. There are no discernible morphological features between male and female, until adult plants (6&#x02013;10 year-old) flower in spring when their sex can be easily distinguished by appearance of flowers. Male panicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064276.s001">Figure S1</xref>, A) are pale green and female panicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064276.s001">Figure S1</xref>, B) are purple.</p><p>Male and female wild plants of <italic>P. chinensis</italic> (approximately 10 to 40 years of age) were used for this study. The age of each individual was estimated by diameter at breast height, as described previously <xref rid="pone.0064276-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Leaves were sampled in summer, and twigs were sampled in automn and winter. Samples were manually selected, frozen immediately in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis. No specific permits were required for the described field studies, which did not involve endangered or protected species.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Preparation of acetone tissue powder</title><p>Leaf, stem xylem and stem phloem, rather than reproductive organs/tissues, were used for materials, because differentially expressed proteins in reproductive organs/tissues may not be suitable for sex determination of siblings at juvenile stage. One pair of healthy leaflets each compound leaf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064276.s001">Figure S1</xref>, C) were selected for preparation of acetone tissue powder. Frozen twigs were soaked in water for 30&#x02013;60 min so as to facilitate the separation of xylem with phloem. Xylem and phloem were manually separated out. The phloem was pale green, indicating the presence of chlorophyll (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064276.s001">Figure S1</xref>, D). Xylem exists inside the twigs and is less affected by the external conditions than leaf and stem phloem. It can be sampled all the year around, while leaves are only available during the growth season. In addition, xylem is more easily separated out from the twigs than phloem. Therefore, xylem, if appropriate, would be a good choice as material for sex determination.</p><p>Plant material was pulverized to a fine powder in liquid N<sub>2</sub> using a mortar and pestle.

The extract was transferred into a fresh tube and then clarified by centrifugation at 15000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with equal volume of buffered phenol (pH 8.0, Sigma, P4557). Phases were separated by centrifugation at 15000 g for 5 min. The phenol phase was precipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate overnight (&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C). Protein was recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with cold acetone. Air-dried protein pellet was dissolved in 2-DE rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer, 20 mM DTT and a trace amount of bromophenol blue).

After IEF, gel strips were equilibrated for 15 min in the equilibration buffer containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol and 0.1 M DTT, followed by another 15 min in another equilibration buffer in which 0.1 M DTT was replaced by 0.25 M iodoacetamide. Afterwards, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained in 0.1% CBB R-250 overnight and destained in 10% acetic acid.

Females in dioecious plant populations often invest more in reproduction and less in growth and maintenance than males <xref rid="pone.0064276-Agren1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This differential investment between sexes may result in distinct growth patterns <xref rid="pone.0064276-Popp1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and sex-specific responses to environmental stresses <xref rid="pone.0064276-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It is expected that such difference would display at the proteome level. Therefore, vegetative tissues, rather than reproductive tissues were used to find out proteins whose abundance changes significantly between both sexes, which will provide a cue for sex identification in <italic>P. chinensis</italic> prior to flowering. Especially, xylem would be a good choice as material for sex determination, since xylem exists inside the stem, less affected by the external conditions than leaf and stem phloem, more easily separated out from the stem than phloem all the year around.</p><p>The phenol-based protein extraction protocol has been proved to work well in various plant tissues, including woody tissues <xref rid="pone.0064276-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064276-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This protocol is also suitable for <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. Protein yields are high. The 2-DE analysis reveals well-resolved of most protein spots throughout the gel with little streaking, indicating the high quality of the protein preparation.</p><p>In this study, 2-DE analysis has revealed a total of 10 differential protein spots (p&#x02264;0.05) in vegetative tissues between male and female plants in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. As the <italic>P. chinensis</italic> genome has not yet been sequenced, MS/MS analysis followed by database searches of proteins in the taxonomy of green plants has been used to identify proteins of interest, as in other unsequenced plant species <xref rid="pone.0064276-Renuse1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As a result, 7 spots had a significant match (MASCOT score&#x0003e;69; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064276-t001">Table 1</xref>) with 6 functional proteins from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (mouse ear cress), <italic>Pennisetum americanum</italic> (pearl millet), <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> (castor oil plant), <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> (tomato), <italic>Tamarix androssowii</italic> (salt cedar) and <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (grape vine). In particular, PGK existed in high abundance in the stem phloem in female, but almost not detected in the male. TIL was highly abundant in stem xylem and stem phloem in male plants, while its expression was much low in female plants. Blast analysis showed that TIL (Q38JE1) in the stem phloem and that (B9SBY6) in the stem xylem share high identities (85%) and positives (94%). Hence, it is assumed that PGK and TIL might be promising candidates to serve as molecular markers for sex determination in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. In addition, these differentially expressed proteins between both sexes in <italic>P. chinensis</italic> are highly tissue specific: two in chloroplasts of leaves, two in stem xylem and three in stem phloem. These differences in protein expression found in adult plants are needed to be examined in juvenile plants of <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. Obviously, protein profiles of plant tissues of the same type are similar and undependable of tree age. This is reasonable because the actual ages of leaves or twigs are similar, no matter from 10- or 40-year-old plants.</p><p>In this study, most of the identified proteins including NB-ARC domain containing proteins, LHCII, APX, TIL, eIF-5A2 and PGK are involved in defence and stress responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064276-t001">Table 1</xref>). Most resistance proteins have a centrally located NB-ARC domain, which consists of three subdomains: a nucleotide-binding (NB) domain and a C-terminal extension that forms a four-helix bundle (ARC1) and a winged-helix fold (ARC2) <xref rid="pone.0064276-Wladimir1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Mutations in the NB-ARC domain often abolish R-protein function. The NB-ARC domains for tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>) R-proteins are functional ATPase modules that specifically bind and hydrolyze ATP <italic>in</italic> vitro <xref rid="pone.0064276-Tameling1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. LHCII is the important component of the light harvesting complex <xref rid="pone.0064276-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, involved in light reactions in photosynthesis. More LHCII in male <italic>P. chinensis</italic> is consistent with a previous observation that male plants show higher chlorophyll a/b ratio than female plants <xref rid="pone.0064276-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. APX is well known to play an essential role in scavenging reactive oxygen species, with ascorbate serving as the electron donor <xref rid="pone.0064276-Navrot1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. TIL is involved in modulating plant tolerance to oxidative and temperature stresses <xref rid="pone.0064276-Charron1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064276-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Arabidopsis eIF-5A2 plays a crucial role in plant growth and development by regulating cell division, cell growth and cell death <xref rid="pone.0064276-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Cytoplasmic PGK, catalyzing the formation of ATP to ADP and <italic>vice versa</italic>, takes part in glycolysis in plants <xref rid="pone.0064276-KpkeSecundo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. PGK levels were enhanced by low temperature stress in rice leaf blades <xref rid="pone.0064276-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and by salt stress in rice leaf laminas <xref rid="pone.0064276-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, suggesting that it is an early responsive protein to both salt stress and cold stress. Furthermore, the identified sex-related proteins in <italic>P. chinensis</italic> are stress/defence proteins, and exist in more abundance in male than in female, suggesting an increased resistance of male plants. This agrees with previous studies in several dioecious plants in response to salinity, drought stress <xref rid="pone.0064276-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064276-Xu3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and other environmental stresses <xref rid="pone.0064276-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and females usually show a lower tolerance capacity compared with males.</p><p>In addition, the identified proteins related to sex in <italic>P. chinensis</italic> here are all functional proteins. Previous studies have showed that there existed various functional, housekeeping gene differences between male and female in dioecious plants. For instance, it is suggested that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> homologs of shootmeristemless (STM) and cup shaped cotyledon 1 (CUC1) and CUC2 genes in <italic>S. latifolia</italic> could be strong candidates in the involvement of sex determination <xref rid="pone.0064276-Zluvova1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In dioecious Kiwifruit (<italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic>), 15 differentially expressed genes have been isolated and sequenced from male and female floral buds, including pectin methylesterase (a cell-wall modifying enzyme) and a ADP-ribosylation factor (a small GTP-binding protein) <xref rid="pone.0064276-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, both of which are abundantly expressed in male floral buds than in female floral buds. It is suggested that sex determining genes may be present in the genomes of hermaphroditic plants, but may have quite different functions in some plants <xref rid="pone.0064276-Ainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, a range of sex-linked molecular markers such as RAPD, RFLP, AFLP and microsatellite have been generated for sex determination in dioecious plants. These techniques need to design and try different sets of random primers <xref rid="pone.0064276-Hormaza1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064276-Korpelainen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and the function of amplified products is often unclear <xref rid="pone.0064276-Yakubov1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064276-Esfandiyari1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, while proteomic analysis directly identify the changes of gene products (proteins) in abundance <xref rid="pone.0064276-Cravatt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in most cases the functions of these proteins identified are known. As for sex determination, both techniques are appropriate if they can distinguish male and female plants.</p><p>In conclusion, our study has revealed that several functional, stress proteins change in abundance greatly between both sexes in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. The identified sex-related proteins will be useful to better understand the molecular events of sex differentiation. Three proteins (APX, PGK and TIL) might serve as molecular markers for sex determination in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>. The results form the basis for a further understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of sex determination in <italic>P. chinensis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0064276.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
