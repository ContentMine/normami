Whether similar mechanisms operate in plants is not known. In plants, shoot apical meristems serve as reservoirs of stem cells that provide cells for all above ground organs. WUSCHEL, a homeodomain TF produced in cells of the niche, migrates into adjacent cells where it specifies stem cells. Through high-resolution genomic analysis, we show that WUSCHEL represses a large number of genes that are expressed in differentiating cells including a group of differentiation promoting TFs involved in leaf development.

Predictions from a computational model, supported by live imaging, reveal that WUS-mediated repression prevents premature differentiation of stem cell progenitors, being part of a minimal regulatory network for meristem maintenance.

Unlike animal systems, stem cell homeostasis in plant systems does not involve cell behaviors such as physical asymmetric cell divisions, oriented cell divisions and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Reddy, 2008</xref>). For example, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) stem cell niche that resides at the tip of each shoot harbours a set of pluripotent stem cells within the central zone (CZ) and provides cells for the development of all aboveground organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Steeves and Sussex, 1989</xref>). The progeny of stem cells enters the flanking peripheral zone (PZ) where they differentiate into leaves or flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Rib-meristem (RM)/organizing center (OC) located beneath the CZ functions as niche and provides cues for stem cell specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mayer et al, 1998</xref>). It is believed that regulated patterns of cell division rates of stem cells and their progenitors are important in the timely transition of stem cell progenitors to differentiation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Meyerowitz, 1997</xref>). In this context, it is essential to understand the molecular logic that underlies stem cell maintenance in the SAM stem cell niche.</p><p>The homeodomain TF WUSCHEL (WUS), which is expressed in the OC/niche, has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for stem cell specification in overlying cells of the CZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mayer et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Schoof et al, 2000</xref>). Besides stem cell specification, WUS restricts its own levels by activating <italic>CLAVATA3 (CLV3)</italic> transcription in the CZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fletcher et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Brand et al, 2000</xref>). CLV3, a small secreted peptide, activates CLAVATA1 receptor kinase pathway to restrict <italic>WUS</italic> transcription to few cells, thus forming a feedback system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Clark et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ogawa et al, 2008</xref>). A recent study has shown that WUS protein synthesized in the niche migrates into adjacent cells and activates <italic>CLV3</italic> transcription by binding to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). This study also reveals that the WUS protein gradient extends into the PZ where stem cell progenitors differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). Understanding of the WUS function in cells of the PZ may reveal molecular logic of stem cell maintenance. Two lines of evidence have suggested that WUS represses differentiation. First, a live imaging study has shown that WUS determines organ primordia size by regulating patterns of differentiation in the PZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Yadav et al, 2010</xref>). Second, genomic analysis has revealed that WUS downregulates genes expressed in leaves including genes that encode components of transcriptional repression complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Busch et al, 2010</xref>). However, the repressed target genes presented do not provide immediate clues to their function in regulating stem cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Busch et al, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have developed a WUS-responsive gene network at a higher spatial resolution, which reveals that WUS represses several key TFs implicated in various aspects of leaf differentiation. By employing biochemical methods, we further show that WUS directly binds to the promoter regions of <italic>KANADI1</italic>, <italic>KANADI2</italic>, <italic>YABBY3</italic> and <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2</italic>, TF encoding genes that are expressed in the PZ and mediate early aspects of leaf differentiation. We develop a cell-based computational model of the SAM by integrating WUS-mediated direct transcriptional repression of differentiation with a CLAVATA/WUSCHEL regulatory network model. The differential equation model predicts that WUS function is required to prevent premature differentiation of stem cell progenitors. We validate model perturbation predictions through transient manipulation of WUS levels followed by live imaging, which shows that WUS-mediated direct transcriptional repression is required to keep differentiation program at a distance from the meristem center/stem cell domain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of a high spatial resolution WUS-responsive gene network</title><p>To explain the function of WUS in stem cell maintenance, we developed a high-resolution spatial map of the WUS-regulated transcriptome. An earlier study has employed FACS-mediated purification of distinct cell types of the stem cell niche to develop a cell type-specific high-resolution map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yadav et al, 2009</xref>). The method that is based on isolating fluorescently labeled cell populations from SAMs of <italic>apetala1-1;cauliflower1-1</italic> (<italic>ap1-1;cal1-1</italic>) double mutants has been shown to accurately report gene expression patterns and also to be highly sensitive in detecting transcripts of &#x0223c;1000 genes that have not been detected, in any developmental stages, when whole tissues were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yadav et al, 2009</xref>). We introduced a dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible form of <italic>WUS</italic> consisting of the WUS protein-coding region fused to the ligand-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR), expressed under a ubiquitous promoter (<italic>35S::WUS-GR</italic>) into <italic>apetala1-1;cauliflower1-1 (ap1-1;cal1-1)</italic> double mutant background. <italic>35S::WUS-GR;ap1-1;cal1-1</italic> SAMs that were treated with 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Dex solution for 12&#x02009;h revealed an increase in stem cell domain as revealed by <italic>CLV3</italic> (a WUS target gene) promoter activity when compared with mock-treated SAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). WUS-mediated activation of <italic>CLV3</italic> was observed as early as 2&#x02009;hs after Dex application with <italic>CLV3</italic> expression reaching maximum levels by 4&#x02009;h and saturating by 6&#x02009;h after Dex application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, SAMs were treated with 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Dex solution for 4&#x02009;h and RNA samples were hybridized to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ATH1 gene Chip (Affymetrix). To identify putative genes that are directly regulated by WUS, SAMs were, in independent experiments, simultaneously treated with 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Dex and 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Cycloheximide (Cyc), protein synthesis inhibitor and Cyc alone for 4&#x02009;h. A comparison of Dex-treated samples with mock identified 641 genes as differentially expressed (DEGs) (&#x02a7e;/&#x02a7d;2-fold; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), which consisted of 238 upregulated genes and 403 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). While a comparison of Dex&#x0002b;Cyc with Cyc identified 457 genes as DEGs (&#x02a7e;/&#x02a7d;2-fold; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), which consisted of 154 upregulated genes and 303 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 3</xref>). Next, we compared the overlap between genes that respond to WUS upon Dex treatment alone with Dex&#x0002b;Cyc treatment by constructing a four-way Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This analysis revealed a set of 49 upregulated genes and 140 downregulated genes that were common to both treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>WUS represses a group of differentiation promoting TFs</title><p>To determine the role of WUS-responsive genes, we mapped their patterns of expression on the various sub-domains of the SAM. An earlier study has shown that 2361 genes are differentially expressed (&#x02a7e;2-fold; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.01) across three cell types including the CZ, the RM and the PZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yadav et al, 2009</xref>). To visualize the spatial distribution of WUS-responsive genes, we superimposed DEGs on to the cell type-specific gene expression map. In all, 17&#x00025; (40 genes out of 238) transcripts activated by WUS in Dex versus mock comparison (&#x02a7e;2-fold; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.01) were mapped to the CZ and the RM while only 5&#x00025; transcripts (11 genes) were found in the PZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). An opposite trend was observed for genes that were downregulated wherein 38&#x00025; (152 genes out of 403) (&#x02a7d;2-fold difference; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.01) transcripts were either mapped to the PZ or their expression was detected in both the PZ and the RM. Only 10&#x00025; (42 genes) were found in the CZ and the RM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), showing that WUS represses a large group of genes expressed in differentiating cells. The genes that were not mapped to any of the three cell types may be broadly expressed in SAMs. Alternately, the resolution of the expression map that involves just three cell types may be limited to resolve genes enriched in individual cell layers of the SAM since <italic>CLV3</italic> expression domain overlaps with that of WUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yadav et al, 2009</xref>). In Dex&#x0002b;Cyc versus Cyc comparison, 17&#x00025; (26 genes out of 154) WUS-activated genes mapped to the CZ and the RM while only 8&#x00025; (12 genes) were part of the PZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Among 303 downregulated genes, only 11&#x00025; (33 genes) were mapped to the CZ and the RM while 29&#x00025; (87 genes) of them were either part of the PZ or their expression was detected in both the PZ and the RM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Activation of <italic>CLV3</italic> and repression of <italic>ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 7</italic> and <italic>15</italic> were observed in the presence of Cyc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with them being direct transcriptional targets of WUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Leibfried et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Zhao et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). To exclude artifacts, if any, from <italic>ap1-1;cal1-1</italic> SAMs, we re-analyzed a select set of genes identified in the microarray experiments by performing qRT&#x02013;PCR analysis on RNA samples extracted from finely dissected wild-type SAMs expressing <italic>35S::WUS:GR</italic>. This analysis showed that all six of the activated targets tested including <italic>CLV3</italic> were activated within 4&#x02009;h of WUS induction in both the absence and the presence of Cyc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). A similar agreement between microarray analysis and qRT&#x02013;PCR analysis was observed for 14 of the repressed targets analyzed in both the absence and the presence of Cyc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal that a majority of WUS-activated genes are broadly expressed within the central parts of SAMs and that WUS represses a large group of genes expressed in the PZ. A similar trend was observed in Cyc-treated SAMs, suggesting that WUS may repress genes expressed in differentiating cells of the PZ through a direct transcriptional control.</p><p>Among genes downregulated in the presence of Cyc, 37 were annotated as TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The repressed TFs included key TFs implicated in leaf polarity establishment and differentiation such as <italic>KANADI 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<italic>KAN1</italic> and <italic>KAN2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kerstetter et al, 2001</xref>), <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2</italic> (<italic>AS2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lin et al, 2003</xref>) and <italic>YABBY 3</italic> (<italic>YAB3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kumaran et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).

We analyzed the RNA localization patterns of a select set of differentiation promoting TFs repressed by WUS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Expression of <italic>KAN1</italic>, <italic>KAN2</italic> and <italic>AS2</italic> was restricted to few cells of the PZ of both SAMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A&#x02013;C</xref>) and floral meristems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2D&#x02013;F</xref>). Taken together, our results show that WUS represses a group of differentiation promoting TFs thus excluding them from stem cells of the CZ.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>WUS represses differentiation promoting TFs by binding to their regulatory regions</title><p>Next, we tested whether WUS directly binds to the regulatory regions of repressed TFs by performing ChIP coupled to qPCR analysis (ChIP-qPCR) by using anti-WUS (peptide)-antibodies described in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). We obtained immunoprecipitated DNA that was enriched in specific genomic regions of <italic>KAN1, KAN2, AS2</italic> and <italic>YAB3</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A&#x02013;D</xref>). We used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) for fine mapping of WUS binding sites within these genomic regions by testing a series of short oligonucleotides for their ability to bind to WUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>). DNA sequences of <italic>KAN1, KAN2, AS2</italic> and <italic>YAB3</italic> that bound WUS revealed the presence of conserved TAAT core sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). Previous studies have shown a similar WUS binding specificity to TAAT containing sequence elements in EMSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lohmann et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Leibfried et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Busch et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). In some cases, for example the sequence of KAN2 650, AS2&#x02212;480, AS2 750 and YAB3 500 oligonucleotides contained more than one TAAT motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>). Therefore, we explored the WUS binding specificity of <italic>KAN1, KAN2, AS2</italic> and <italic>YAB3</italic> promoter-specific oligonucleotides by introducing mutations into all TAAT motifs present in them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>). Mutations within the TAAT core sequences abolished WUS binding, suggesting that WUS binding to these sequences is specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;G</xref>). In cases where more than one TAAT core was detected, a selective lack of binding was observed with mutations in certain TAAT elements and not others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>). This analysis shows that TAAT sequences are important but not sufficient to determine WUS binding specificity. In addition, a &#x02018;super shift' was observed when <italic>KAN1</italic> promoter oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>) were incubated with anti-WUS antibody confirming the presence of WUS protein in WUS-DNA complex. We next tested whether the WUS-binding element found in the <italic>KAN1</italic> promoter can modulate transcription in a heterologous transient expression system by examining the LUCIFERASE (LUC) reporter expression levels in protoplasts isolated from mesophyll cells of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves.

To understand the importance of the direct transcriptional repression of differentiation genes by WUS, we implemented these interactions in a differential equations model of a three-dimensional SAM tissue, and integrated it with a model of the core CLV3-WUS negative feedback stem cell regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). The model includes the direct activation of <italic>CLV3</italic> transcription from the diffusing WUS protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>), as well as activation from a signal originating from the epidermal cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">J&#x000f6;nsson et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). Although a signal originating in the L1 is yet to be identified in molecular experiments, we propose such a signal based on the behavior of a meristem model in specific mutants in which <italic>CLV3</italic> expression is limited to the outermost cells even when the SAM undergoes dramatic morphogenetic changes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brand et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). The expression of <italic>WUS</italic> is negatively regulated from a diffusive CLV3 signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fletcher et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Brand et al, 2000</xref>), and is activated by a static cytokinin/AHK4 signal located at the center of the OC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">J&#x000f6;nsson et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gordon et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). In this model, we introduced interactions between WUS and the PZ, where <italic>KAN1</italic> was used as a PZ representative. <italic>KAN1</italic> expression as revealed by <italic>pKAN1::KAN1:GFP</italic> (<italic>KAN1</italic> promoter driving the expression of <italic>KAN1:GFP</italic> translational fusion) shows that it is expressed in the outer edges of the PZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). We introduced a direct transcriptional repression of <italic>KAN1</italic> by the WUS protein as revealed by this study. To generate a sharp <italic>KAN1</italic> expression close to the epidermis, we also introduced an activating signal originating from the L1 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Note that this addition only keeps the <italic>KAN1</italic> expression close to the epidermis, all results reported in this study would be the same without it, except that the PZ gene would be expressed also in internal layers of the PZ. An earlier study has shown that ubiquitous misexpression of <italic>KAN1</italic> results in SAM termination which was argued to be a consequence of abaxialization of leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kerstetter et al, 2001</xref>). We tested whether ubiquitous <italic>KAN1</italic> misexpression leads to downregulation of <italic>WUS</italic> levels by using Dex-inducible KAN1 (<italic>35S::KAN1:GR</italic>). An RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of <italic>35S::KAN1:GR</italic> seedlings exposed to 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Dex for 5 days revealed a downregulation of <italic>WUS</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). An earlier study has also shown that <italic>YABBY3</italic> and <italic>FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL)</italic> which are expressed in differentiating cells of organ primordia are required to restrict <italic>WUS</italic> and <italic>CLV3</italic> expression domains through a non-cell autonomous mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Goldshmidt et al, 2008</xref>).

From these data, we use KAN1 as a representative PZ signal modeled as a non-diffusing protein repressing <italic>WUS</italic> expression. Since this interaction has not been verified at the molecular level, we used the model to investigate how different interactions from the PZ on the CLV3/WUS network behaved when ubiquitous expression of <italic>KAN1</italic> was introduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>).

Transcription is modeled with Hill functions and proteins are linearly created based on RNA concentrations (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>).

The domains were defined using confocal microscopy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C&#x02013;E</xref>).

Simulations with the 229 different parameter sets show some variance in the quantitative behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 12</xref>), but interestingly the model interaction network is robust in the qualitative (increase versus decrease) response to almost all perturbations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). All perturbations correspond qualitatively with experimentally measured changes in expression domains, where available, and other simulations can be seen as predictions of changes. Loss-of-function mutants have been repeatedly studied in the literature and these mutants were implemented in the model at the protein level making it possible to investigate the changes in mRNA levels of the perturbed gene due to the network interactions. The <italic>clv3</italic> loss-of-function shows an increase in <italic>WUS</italic> transcripts and an increase in <italic>CLV3</italic> promoter activity and subsequent expansion, and these simulations are consistent with experimental observations made upon transiently downregulating <italic>CLV3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Reddy and Meyerowitz, 2005</xref>), although our static template cannot address the increase in SAM size.

The perturbation of parameters for KAN1 levels do not influence CLV3 or WUS at all; KAN1 does not influence the core network results including when perturbed, except for when KAN1 is expressed ectopically. More important is the dependence of CLV3/WUS on each other, where the direct interactions are seen, for example, when gene expression activities are altered (<italic>V</italic><sub>W</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>C</sub>), while the feedback mechanism leading to homeostasis is also indicated, for example, an increased CLV3 (WUS) production (<italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>W</sub>) leads to decreased <italic>CLV3</italic> (<italic>WUS</italic>) expression.

WUS also activates <italic>GLABRA1</italic> implicated in epidermal cell fate specification (GO:0001708; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Taken together, WUS activates genes implicated in diverse plant processes including those that are critical for stem cell maintenance. The WUS downregulated transcriptome contained significantly enriched GO categories that represent indole derivatives and biosynthesis processes (GO:0042435, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;8.19 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), regulation of gene expression (GO:0010468, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.002) and cell-to-cell communication and the catalyzation of post-translation modification (GO:0043687, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

Here, we have shown that WUS represses transcription of differentiation promoting TFs by directly binding to the promoter regions. Thus, the WUS-mediated repression of differentiation program observed in this study links the PZ with the well-established feedback loop between cells of the CZ and the RM through a direct transcriptional control. The dual function of WUS in regulating its own level by activating a negative regulator and repressing differentiation would lead to a robust homeostatic mechanism by balancing stem cell numbers and differentiation rates of stem cell progenitors in a dynamic cellular environment. Our computational model, integrating the WUS-PZ interactions extracted in this work with WUS-CZ interactions, highlights this by robustly generating the spatial patterns for <italic>CLV3</italic> and <italic>KAN1</italic> expression, and the use of the multiple (17) model perturbations connects our findings with more than a decade of previous experimental work. Since no interaction in the model can be removed without losing ability to explain some experimental work, it also suggests that the current model provides a minimal model for regulating stem cell maintenance in the SAM. WUS has been shown to form a concentration gradient with higher levels in the OC/RM and lower levels in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>). It is intriguing how a single WUS gradient results in the transcriptional activation of some genes, and the repression of other genes in placing a negative regulator at a distance from its own domain of expression while keeping the differentiation program repressed in stem cell progenitors, and the computational model resolves this by having different WUS thresholds for CZ and PZ regulation. WUS has been shown to act both as an activator and as a repressor of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Ikeda et al, 2009</xref>). WUS utilizes DNA binding cis-elements containing similar core sequences (TAAT) both to activate <italic>CLV3</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>) and to repress expression of differentiation promoting TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore, WUS may utilize spatially localized co-activators and co-repressors to modulate transcriptional output. The computational model requires an L1-derived signal to position <italic>CLV3</italic> expression domain within the CZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">J&#x000f6;nsson et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yadav et al, 2011</xref>), which is consistent with the requirement of additional factors that may function along with WUS. One such spatial signal could be the local synthesis of active cytokinins in superficial cell layers as suggested by the expression patterns of <italic>LONELYGUY</italic> class of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yadav et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chickarmane et al, 2012</xref>). Genome-wide expression profiles that have been described will form a rich resource in identifying regional factors that may modulate WUS function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yadav et al, 2009</xref>). WUS binds to some TAAT containing sequences but not all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;H</xref>), suggesting that sequence context may determine binding specificity. However, a comparison of WUS binding sequences of several WUS-regulated genes did not reveal any consensus sequences around the TAAT core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4H</xref>). Shape analysis of cis-element sequences that bind <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeodomain TF-HOX has revealed that the width of the minor grove determines the binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rohs et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Slattery et al, 2011</xref>). Future studies unraveling genome-wide WUS binding patterns along with sequence and shape analysis of WUS binding sites may provide insights into WUS binding specificity and transcriptional modulation.</p><p>The use of multiple parameter value sets for the model, and the large consistency for these to respond to perturbations shows the robustness of the modeled SAM gene regulatory network architecture, also during growth. Interestingly, the model predicts that the WUS and CLV3 domains can respond differently to perturbations, indicating the possibility for variability within plant populations. Our methodology, using populations of models (parameter values), is a step toward integrating statistical analysis of experimental population behavior within a modeling framework, something that might be necessary for elucidating the exact regulatory interactions present in the SAM.</p><p>Our work shows that WUS functions to prevent premature differentiation of stem cell progenitors. The computational model shows that the experimentally extracted interactions where WUS binds directly and represses the expression of TFs involved in PZ differentiation are sufficient to explain the dynamic changes caused by transient perturbations where expression domains grow or shrink at the boundaries. However, transient depletion of WUS fails to induce differentiation of long-term stem cells within the CZ as suggested by lack of misexpression of auxin-sensitive differentiation marker shown in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Yadav et al, 2010</xref>) and lack of misexpression of <italic>KAN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 9J</xref>).

This suggests that long-term stem cells may be active in these mutants and argues for function of overlapping mechanisms in protecting long-term stem cells from differentiation signals, as also suggested by the computational model showing a stronger expression phenotype compared with the experiment. The WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX5 (WOX5) TF of the WUS family is expressed in the quiescent center of the root meristem and has been shown to repress differentiation of neighboring initials/stem cells in a non-cell autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sarkar et al, 2007</xref>). This suggests that WOX-mediated suppression of differentiation of stem cell progenitors is a conserved theme in both shoot and root stem cell niches. Future work should reveal whether WOX5 shares mechanistic similarities with WUS with regard to the nature of non-cell autonomous signaling and molecular mechanisms of repression of differentiation.</p><p>An increase in WUS levels leads to de-differentiation of stem cell progenitors into stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Reddy and Meyerowitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Yadav et al, 2010</xref>). Our work provides a molecular basis for de-differentiation wherein WUS-mediated direct repression of differentiation program plays an important role. Deciphering how stem cell progenitors are maintained in WUS-responsive state requires an understanding of the molecular control of the cellular memory system. Studies on murine ES cells have identified bi-valent stretches of both H3 lysine 27 methylation, a gene repressive chromatin mark and H3 lysine 4 methylation, a gene activating chromatin mark within genes which encode differentiation promoting TFs that are repressed by master regulatory stem cell promoting TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bernstein et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Mikkelsen et al, 2007</xref>).
