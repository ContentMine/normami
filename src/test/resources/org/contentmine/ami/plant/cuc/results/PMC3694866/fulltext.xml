The degree of manipulation of host gene expression is dependent on host-virus specificity and certain abiotic factors. In order to gain insight into global transcriptome changes for a geminivirus pathosystem, <italic>South African cassava mosaic virus</italic> [ZA:99] and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, 4&#x000d7;44K Agilent microarrays were adopted. After normalization, a log2 fold change filtering of data (p&#x0003c;0.05) identified 1,743 differentially expressed genes in apical leaf tissue. A significant increase in differential gene expression over time correlated with an increase in SACMV accumulation, as virus copies were 5-fold higher at 24 dpi and 6-fold higher at 36 dpi than at 14 dpi. Many altered transcripts were primarily involved in stress and defense responses, phytohormone signalling pathways, cellular transport, cell-cycle regulation, transcription, oxidation-reduction, and other metabolic processes. Only forty-one genes (2.3%) were shown to be continuously expressed across the infection period, indicating that the majority of genes were transient and unique to a particular time point during infection. A significant number of pathogen-responsive genes were suppressed during the late stages of pathogenesis, while during active systemic infection (14 to 24 dpi), there was an increase in up-regulated genes in several GO functional categories. An adaptive response was initiated to divert energy from growth-related processes to defense, leading to disruption of normal biological host processes. Similarities in cell-cycle regulation correlated between SACMV and <italic>Cabbage leaf curl virus</italic> (CaLCuV), but differences were also evident. Differences in gene expression between the two geminiviruses clearly demonstrated that, while some global transcriptome responses are generally common in plant virus infections, temporal host-specific interactions are required for successful geminivirus infection. To our knowledge this is the first geminivirus microarray study identifying global differentially expressed transcripts at 3 time points.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was from the National Bioinformatics Network through the Department of Science and Technology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dst.gov.za">www.dst.gov.za</ext-link>) and the National Research Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nrf.ac.za">www.nrf.ac.za</ext-link>).

The degree of transcriptome change that a particular host undergoes will change spatially and temporally, and will depend on the compatibility and adaptibility of the pathogen. This host-genotype combination thus determines the severity and type of symptoms displayed <xref rid="pone.0067534-AgudeloRomero1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Babu2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Elena1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

This in turn has a huge impact on host cells and causes abnormalities in plant growth and development. Not all changes in host gene expression and metabolism are initiated by specific interactions between virus and host proteins, and alterations can also be consequences of general accumulation of viral proteins and subversion of cellular components <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Plant viruses are biotrophic pathogens which cause alterations (either by induction or repression) to a wide array of cellular processes, at transcriptional, translational or posttranslational levels <xref rid="pone.0067534-LozanoDuran1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These processes include, among others, hormonal regulation, cell-cycle control and endogenous transport of macromolecules <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Babu2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Havelda1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Pallas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. From an evolutionary perspective, a constant battle between plant defense and virus infection exists. Plants are capable of counteracting the effects of virus attack with pre-existing physical and chemical barriers (constitutive defense), which if overcome by the virus, activate signalling pathways (induced responses) as the next line of defense. Constitutive (preformed) defences are usually non-specific and are effective against a wide array of abiotic and biotic stresses. Induced responses are more targeted and are triggered upon herbivorous insect or microbial pathogen attack. These specific responses are co-ordinated by defense-related hormones involved in signalling pathways <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Pallas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Ballare1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Upon pathogen attack, induced defences rely on energy resources which are critical to plant fitness. In order to minimise fitness costs and maximise defense responses, plants possess regulatory mechanisms to coordinate pathogen-specific defense responses, which involve signalling molecules that act systemically throughout the plant <xref rid="pone.0067534-Koornneef1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Salicyclic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) are the main signalling pathways responsible for regulating responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, abscissic acid (ABA), auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids have also been implicated <xref rid="pone.0067534-Koornneef1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Pieterse1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Once activated, these signalling molecules are responsible for reallocating resources away from plant growth and development towards defense. The specificity of plant defense responses is determined by the quantity, composition, and timing of these signal molecules and varies across plant species. The replication and defense strategy of the pathogen determines which defense-related genes are triggered by the plant <xref rid="pone.0067534-Koornneef1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Pieterse1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Following pathogen infection, antagonistic or synergistic cross talk between signalling pathways enables the plant to devise optimal resistance strategies in order to minimise fitness costs and activate specific defenses. Generally, SA-mediated defenses are usually induced by biotrophic pathogens, whereas necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects are more sensitive to JA/ET mediated defenses <xref rid="pone.0067534-Koornneef1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Pathogens on the other hand, are also capable of manipulating these signalling networks as well as suppressing induced defenses for their own benefit, resulting in host susceptibility <xref rid="pone.0067534-Pallas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Koornneef1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>South African cassava mosaic virus</italic> [ZA:99] (SACMV) infects an important food security crop, cassava (<italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz), in Sub-Saharan Africa, and causes extensive damage to the crop, resulting in Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) <xref rid="pone.0067534-Berrie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. SACMV is a member of the genus <italic>Begomovirus</italic>, and belongs to the <italic>Geminiviridae</italic> family, whose members are transmitted by the whitefly, <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Gennadius) <xref rid="pone.0067534-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Gorovits1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Its genome is bipartite, consisting of a DNA-A and DNA-B segment of 2800 nt and 2760 nt, respectively <xref rid="pone.0067534-Berrie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The bipartite-genome of SACMV encodes at least four proteins on the DNA- A: the viral strand contains the coat protein (CP or AV1) and the pre-CP (AV2). The complementary strand contains three proteins; AC1, AC2 and AC3 from overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). AC1 is required for initiation of DNA replication and is termed the replication-associated protein (Rep), AC2 (TrAP) activates transcription in both the DNA-A and DNA-B of the viral sense genes, and AC3 is the DNA replication enhancer (REn). DNA-B encodes two proteins, namely BC1 and BV1 which are involved in intracellular, intercellular and systemic virus movement. BC1 is found on the complementary strand and mediates cell-to-cell movement of the virus. BV1 is the nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) which controls movement of viral DNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0067534-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Gafni1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Fontes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

In order to complete infection in a host, geminiviruses need to modify certain host-cell pathways. Such changes include:- modulation of plasmodesmata structure and function, host silencing-related defense mechanisms, interactions with proteins such as NAC-domain (<italic>NAM,ATAF1/ATAF2</italic>, and <italic>CUC2)</italic> containing proteins which are involved in growth and development regulation, host gene expression changes, and retinoblastoma-related (RBR) pathway interference <xref rid="pone.0067534-Jeske1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-MillsLujan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Gutierrez2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-HanleyBowdoin1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Global analyses of exceptionally large datasets are emerging from transcriptome, protein-protein interaction and regulatory, developmental and metabolic pathway studies in order to construct networks that systematically categorize function and interaction between molecules or organisms at differing levels of complexities <xref rid="pone.0067534-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

Furthermore, each virus-host interaction is unique in terms of altered expression levels, but at the same time, there are some shared genes affected by all viruses.

Global monitoring of gene expression was essential to distinguish if host alterations were SACMV-specific and/or a general biotic stress response. Results from this study, and correlations with other plant viruses, has provided further insight into the little that is known about geminivirus gene expression changes in compatible hosts.

<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (ecotype Columbia-0) seeds were planted in seed trays containing peat pellets (Jiffy Products International), covered with plastic wrap and placed at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 day to eliminate dormancy and ensure uniform germination.

For the over- represented FCs such as metabolism (1); transcription (11); protein fate (folding, modification, destination); protein binding (16); cellular transport (20); signal transduction and cell communication (30); defense and cell rescue (32); interaction with the environment; abiotic stress (34 and 36); biogenesis of cellular components (42); and subcellular localization (70) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the trend for each FC was a significant increase (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the total number of differentially regulated (DE) (repressed and induced) genes from onset of symptoms (14 dpi) to 24 dpi and 24 to 36 dpi (establishment of fully systemic symptoms). Of these differentially expressed (DE) transcripts, notably the percentage of repressed genes compared to total number of altered genes in each FC also increased as infection progressed. Several RNA plant virus studies <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> have indicated that in compatible interactions suppression of host transcription defense responses is a pre-requisite for infection, and this study supports previous findings. Additionally, repression of many host-responsive genes at the later stages of pathogenesis when the geminivirus has successfully established systemic infection, may indicate senescence-related responses, and this trend has also been demonstrated in several plant virus-host interactions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, the pattern of change in up-regulated genes in each FC was not as consistent compared with gene down-regulation. A large number of FCs showed that the percentage of induced genes increased from 14 to 24 dpi, and then remained constant or declined in the later stages (36 dpi) of pathogenesis. The GO FCs for cell cycle and DNA processing, transcription, protein binding and biogenesis of cell components, all showed a significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) increase from 14 to 24 dpi, and this is not surprising since all of these functions would need to be induced in order for SACMV to replicate and move systemically during these early to middle stages of acute infection. Defense and cell rescue related transcripts, representing &#x0223c;12% of all log2 fold or more differentially expressed genes, while also showing an overall increase in percentage of repressed transcripts across the infection period, interestingly had a steady continuous expression of up-regulated genes (12&#x02013;16%) over 36 days and did not change significantly. The total number of up-regulated stress/abiotic-related genes (FCs 34 and 36: interaction with the environment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g003">figure 3</xref>) declined over the 36 day infection period.</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Identification of log2 fold induced and repressed genes</title><p>Once functional categories were established, genes that were continuously expressed across all three time points were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t001">Table 1</xref>) and a gene tree heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g004">Figure 4</xref>) was constructed by applying hierarchical clustering using a Euclidean distance metric and average linkage clustering. A total of 41 genes were found to be continuously expressed across time points, 10 showing up-regulation (24.39%), 23 down-regulation (56.10%), 2 down-regulated at 14 dpi then up-regulated at 24 and 36 dpi (4.88%), 4 up-regulated at 14 and 24 dpi, then down-regulated at 36 dpi (9.76%), and 2 up-regulated at 14 dpi then down-regulated at 24 and 36 dpi (4.88%). In addition, we selected the top 20 genes (10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) displaying the highest and lowest expression values at each time point to identify which host genes are most reactive to SACMV infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t002">Table 2</xref>).

An interesting trend observed was the redirection of up-regulated genes, at 14 dpi, that represent many phytohormone signalling responses and related defense responses, towards a large number of induced genes involved in metabolic processes such as oxidation-reduction, transport, and cell-wall modification at 24 and 36 dpi.

At 14 dpi, 3 up-regulated genes, namely BGL2 (AT3G57260), Ankyrin repeat family protein (AT4G03450), and BG3 (AT3G57240), and two down-regulated genes, Transcription factor family (TCP) (AT2G45680) and Ethylene response factor 4 DNA binding/transcriptional repressor (ERF4)(AT3G15210) confirmed expression results obtained from microarray data.

</title><p>
<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants were observed to be fully symptomatic at 24 dpi, although symptoms started appearing at 12&#x02013;14 dpi. Symptoms such as stunting of the entire plant, leaf reduction and deformation were observed in all SACMV - infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, while additionally, chlorosis was observed in approximately 60% of infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). SACMV was detected in all infected plants tested. Chlorotic symptoms may be the direct result of the plants attempt to rescue resources from infected tissues via basal resistance mechanisms. If chlorosis is absent in infected tissues, this usually indicates a loss of basal resistance <xref rid="pone.0067534-ODonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and the appearance of mild chlorosis in the majority (60%) of SACMV &#x02013; infected Arabidopsis leaves suggests a down-regulation of innate basal resistance leading to expected susceptibility to the virus. An increase in SACMV replication was observed between time points 14 and 24 dpi showing a 5-fold increase. Between 14 and 36 dpi, a 6-fold increase was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that an increase in viral titre correlated with symptom development. These findings were also observed in studies conducted by Babu et al. 2008b <xref rid="pone.0067534-Babu2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> in soybean [<italic>Glycine max</italic> (L.) Merr] plants infected with <italic>Soybean mosaic virus</italic> (SMV) whereby at 14 dpi virus titer was approximately 2-fold higher than 7 dpi as detected by Northern hybridizations. Similarly, in a gene expression study conducted by Golem and Culver 2003 <xref rid="pone.0067534-Golem1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, a greater fold-change increase was also observed in <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV) response genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Shahdara from 4 dpi to 14 dpi, suggesting that higher levels of TMV were present at a later infection time point.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, although containing a disarmed plasmid, is able to cause changes in host gene expression but at very early stages of infection.

In order to eliminate the effects of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> in microarray experiments, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> mock-inoculated controls are commonly used.

Although <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> AGL1 was still detected by PCR, copy numbers were too low to be considered significant, and most likely represent initial replication following the agroinoculation procedure. Additionally, host gene expression changes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are identified by normalization against mock-inoculated controls, ensuring that alterations are solely due to SACMV.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Differentially Expressed Transcript Data</title><p>Gene expression non-filtered data revealed 13,934 significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) differentially expressed genes (including up- and down-regulated transcripts) in response to SACMV infection at three different time points (14, 24, and 36 dpi). Individual gene transcripts were identified at a particular time point and overlap of genes between time points was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Those transcripts that appear to show persistent expression (across two or more time points) may be necessary to carry out appropriate function such as stress and defense-like responses for basal resistance to counteract virus attack or alternatively may be induced or repressed by SACMV to aid in its own replication, cell-to-cell spread and systemic movement, as implicated in other studies <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>As a first step toward assigning differentially expressed genes to function, the distribution of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes significantly induced or repressed at a log2 fold cut-off in SACMV infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves were assigned according to the MIPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/Arabidopsis">http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/Arabidopsis</ext-link>) classification scheme. For the purpose of this study we refer to early response genes as 14 dpi (initiation of symptoms), to 24 dpi as fully symptomatic, middle-phase genes, and to 36 dpi as late response genes. A general overview of 1,743 differentially expressed transcripts revealed more up-regulated genes (203) than down-regulated genes (194) at 14 dpi, and a higher number of repressed genes for both 24 dpi (369) and 36 dpi (701) compared with induced genes at 24 dpi (323) and 36 dpi (275), respectively. The margin between induced and repressed genes at 14 dpi was very narrow (difference of 9 genes favouring up-regulation) which increased to a 46 gene difference at 24 dpi, favouring down-regulation. At 36 dpi, a 426 difference in down-regulated genes was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We propose that the higher number of induced genes at 14 dpi may reflect more of a general non-specific innate host response to virus invasion by the activation of stress and defense-like genes, whereas the increase in down-regulated genes at 24 and 36 dpi is indicative of SACMV attempt to hijack many host processes for its own benefit, leading to repression of a large number of genes. The host (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) may also be attempting to divert metabolites such as those involved in, among others, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pentose-phosphate pathways, and carbohydrate metabolism, away from normal cell function in order to conserve energy, as well as defend itself from SACMV attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparison of 2-fold Gene Expression Patterns with Other Datasets</title><p>In a comparative plant virus microarray study by Postinova and Nemchinov <xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, they demonstrated that collectively from eleven Arabidopsis-virus interaction studies, 7639 unique genes were significantly changed at least log2 fold, which represents 23% of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. SACMV shared 817 genes (across three time points) in common with the 7639 unigenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067534.s003">Table S3</xref>), and 524 genes (across three time points) in common with the geminivirus, CaLCuV, at 12 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067534.s004">Table S4</xref>). Only 19 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067534.s005">Table S5</xref>) were common to SACMV, CaLCuV and the 7639 unigenes <xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This was not surprising as only 198 genes were differentially expressed in response to all eleven viruses (9 RNA; 1 dsDNA; 1 ssDNA) in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> comparative microarray study <xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, pointing to the unique nature of virus-host interactions <xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, as useful as these comparisons are, one must acknowledge the limitations in comparing individual and combined datasets. Another notable observation was that an estimated 12%, 15% and 22% of responsive genes described in the SACMV, eleven <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-virus and CaLCuV studies, respectively, were related to abiotic/biotic stress/defense, and over-representation in this functional category is not uncommon in virus-host interactions <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>In the CaLCuV study <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, at 12 dpi (representing prominent symptoms and active viral replication), a significantly (q value &#x0003c;0.005) high number (5365 representing 23% of the Affymetrix total 22,748 gene probes) of genes were found to be differentially expressed, with 3004 being up-regulated and 2631 down-regulated (6% difference). Similarly in this study, at 14 and 21 dpi, differences in numbers of up-regulated and suppressed genes were not significant, but at 36 dpi there was a significant number of repressed compared with up-regulated genes (difference of 43%). If one compares SACMV at 24 dpi with CaLCuV at 12 dpi (approximate similar stages of infection; fully symptomatic), the number of differentially expressed genes from the total number represented on the arrays, is significantly lower (4% of the Agilent 37,683 array probes) compared with CaLCuV (23%). However, thirty three percent of the 1,743 log2 fold altered transcripts were differentially expressed at 24 dpi in this study, compared with 23% at 12 dpi in CaLCuV-infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This striking difference in gene expression levels, in the identical host, between two different geminiviruses, is hypothesized to be partly attributed to the more virulent nature of CaLCuV in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, resulting in a more severe symptom phenotype, and symptoms appearing much earlier, compared with SACMV. This would point to a greater susceptible host response and a higher number of gene alterations associated with cellular processes redirected by CaLCuV, suggesting that CaLCuV may be less adapted to this non-natural host compared to SACMV. Additionally, we consider it reasonable to speculate that different geographical evolutionary patterns of CaLCuV, a New World northern hemisphere geminivirus, and SACMV (southern hemisphere) from the Old World, in relation to the Arabidopsis, may also contribute to differences in host response.</p><p>Forty-one genes (2.3%) at a log2 fold cut-off were present across all three time points in SACMV infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that most genes were transiently expressed and not sustained throughout virus progression in time. A snapshot of the most significant highly induced and repressed (highest expression values) early-response genes occurring at 14 dpi indicated more signalling-related defense responses, whereas those appearing from middle to late responses (24 and 36 dpi) were primarily involved in metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t002">Table 2</xref>). As the shift continues from early to middle and late gene expression, host metabolism is altered, which suggests that more host metabolites may be diverted to aid in SACMV replication and cell-to-cell-spread, and at the same time, the host is diverting resources away from normal cell functions to minimize fitness costs in an attempt to defend itself against SACMV. At the 24 and 36 post-infection stage, a more specific defense response appears to be induced, evidenced by the induction of putative stress (AT4G12400) and disease resistance (AT1G72920) proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t002">Table 2</xref>).

However, JA/ET signalling may be favoured over SA pathway since marker genes for JA/ET were more highly induced throughout the study, compared with SA. A basal type of resistance response is ongoing, but is unable to prevent SACMV replication and systemic movement.</p><p>Auxin has been shown to be involved in disease susceptibility to viral pathogens <xref rid="pone.0067534-Padmanabhan1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Culver1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-RobertSeilaniantz1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Spaepen1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, for example TMV, where the 126 and 183 kDa replicase disrupts interacting Aux/IAA proteins promoting disease development <xref rid="pone.0067534-Padmanabhan1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.

SA, on the other hand, is able to affect disease susceptibility by repressing the auxin receptor F-box protein TIR1 (Transport Inhibitor response 1, ubiquitin-protein ligase, AT3G62980) causing enhanced resistance <xref rid="pone.0067534-Dharmasiri1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This was not evident in this study as TIR1 was not repressed but up-regulated at 24 dpi (1.52). Furthermore, all auxin-responsive genes identified in our &#x0003e;log2 fold change category were activated by infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t002">2</xref>), suggesting that, together with evidence of TIR1 activation, symptom and disease progression was allowed to continue in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Indeed, the auxin-responsive protein, AT4G38860 (SAUR-like auxin responsive), was up-regulated at 14 dpi (2.98), 24 dpi (3.06), and 36 dpi (2.45) and IAA29 (AT4G32280) was also induced at 14, 24, and 36 dpi (2.32; 3.27; and 2.57, respectively). It may be advantageous for a geminivirus to regulate this pathway as a means to create a favourable cellular environment for replication in apical leaves.</p><p>Brassinosteroids control many aspects of plant growth and development, and are able to induce broad spectrum resistance, but their connection to SA/JA/ET remains to be established <xref rid="pone.0067534-Nakashita1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Bari1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. A receptor - like kinase, BAK1 has been shown to interact with receptors that recognize pathogen molecules. BRI1 is one member of a family of leucine-rich receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) receptors which interacts with BAK1 upon brassinosteroid perception, initiating the signalling pathway involved in growth - and development related processes <xref rid="pone.0067534-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Although the roles of BAK1 in immunity and in brassinosteroid signalling seem to function independently and remain to be elucidated, BRI1 (AT4G39400) was down-regulated in our study at 14 dpi (&#x02212;1.19), and a BKI1 kinase inhibitor (AT5G42750) was shown to be up-regulated at 24 dpi (1.37) indicating SACMV-induced suppression of the BR1 receptor. This in turn would disrupt brassinosteroid signal transduction as transduction requires heterodimerisation of BRI1 and BAK1 to elicit transcriptional activation of responsive genes. In the same way as C4 of another geminivirus, <italic>Beet curly top virus</italic> (BCTV), may suppress antiviral host defence by disrupting LRR-RLK activity <xref rid="pone.0067534-Piroux1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, prevention of brassinosteroid-associated signal perception and downstream deactivation of the LRR-RLK BRI1 by SACMV may contribute to failure to activate transcription of resistance-related responsive genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c2"><title>Signalling and cell-cycle regulation comparison with the bipartite geminivirus, CaLCuV</title><p>Several core cell-cycle genes were found to be differentially expressed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Functional links between plant signalling hormones (auxin, ethylene, brassinosteroids and cytokinins), and cell-cycle proteins have been established <xref rid="pone.0067534-Bari1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Dudits1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, and this is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g007">figure 7</xref>. Plant hormones may either directly influence cell-cycle entry and transition or indirectly through developmental regulatory proteins. It has been shown that auxin may stimulate entry into the S-phase, as shown by an increase in histone H4 promoter activity. We believe that SACMV may be responsible for the induction of auxin partly in order to promote S-phase activation. As evidenced by CaLCuV-induced core cell cycle gene transcriptional alterations, geminiviruses manipulate the core cell cycle genes (induce S-phase and G2 genes) in order to provide a replication-enabling environment <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A similar finding was observed with SACMV, where 44 of the 61 core cell cycle genes <xref rid="pone.0067534-Vandepoele1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We believe this to hold true for SACMV as cyclin genes, such as S-phase CYCA3;2, were induced at both 14 dpi (1.32) and at 36 dpi (1.61). In addition, an auxin-responsive factor protein (AT4G38860) was shown to be up-regulated consistently across time points strongly supporting our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0067534-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067534.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Gene tree heat map of differentially expressed core-cyclin genes in response to SACMV infection.</title><p>All listed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession numbers refer to cyclin-related genes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0067534.g006"/></fig><fig id="pone-0067534-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067534.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Map of potential links between hormonal signals and cell cycle regulators.</title><p>Abbreviations: CK, cytokinin; E2F/DP, transcription factors; RBR, retinoblastoma-related protein; P, phospho-protein; CYC, cyclin; CDK, cyclindependent kinase; PP2A, phosphatase; SCR, SCARECROW; SHR, SHORT ROOT; SCF, SKP1+ CULLIN+F-box (SKP2); EBP1, plant homologue of epidermal growth factor-binding protein; SKP2, F-box protein; STM, SHOOT MERISTEMLESS; KRP, CDK inhibitor; CaM, calmodulin; CPK, calmodulin-like domain protein kinase; ABAP1, armadillo BTB Arabidopsis protein 1; TCP24, transcription factor; CDT1, DNA replication-licensing factor; ABP1, auxin binding protein 1; ANT, aintegumenta; ARGOS, auxin-regulated gene in organ size; AXR1, RUB1-activating enzyme; ABA, abscisic acid; GL2, GLABRA (root hair); GEM, GL2 expression regulator; ACS5, 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxil acid synthase <xref rid="pone.0067534-Vilaine1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.

Down-regulation of CDKB2;1 was noted in both SACMV at 24 dpi (&#x02212;1.69 fold change) and CalCuV at 12 dpi, while CYCB1;1 was induced by both viruses, and in SACMV-infected Arabidopsis remained induced even at 36 dpi. The SACMV results support the proposal suggested by Ascencio-Ibanez et al <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, that elevated CYCB1;1 leads to sequestering factors necessary for G2 arrest, while reduced CDKB2;1 expression at the G2/M boundary maintains G2 and blocks entry into the M phase, leading to shut down of meristem during infection. In an abiotic stress response study, upon gamma-ray (IR) induction <xref rid="pone.0067534-Ricaud1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, G2/M phase inducers such as CYCB2;1 (and CYCB1;4, CYCB2;2, CYCA1;1) and CDKB1;2, were down-regulated, but CYCB1;1 was induced, similar to biotic stresses (CaCuLV) <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and SACMV, as mentioned above. G2 to M transition takes place with CDK complexes containing CYCA and CYCB cyclins. WEE1 kinases and inhibitory proteins (CKI&#x02019;s) phosphorylate CDK complexes in order to keep them in their inactive states. The CKI protein is released by positive phosphorylation by CAK kinase and an unknown protein at the G2 to M boundary, and the kinase is activated <xref rid="pone.0067534-Andrietta1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. A link in SACMV-infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> between CYCB1;1 and auxin is suggested by the observation that the CYCB1;1&#x02032;s promoter contains an auxin response factor (ARF) binding site <xref rid="pone.0067534-Ricaud1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Negative regulators of CDKA;1, namely WEE1, expressed at S-phase, were shown to be up-regulated upon IR induction, most likely to ensure that cell division is delayed from G2 to M <xref rid="pone.0067534-DeSchutter1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. WEE1 (AT1G02970) was also elevated upon SACMV infection, supporting the above-mentioned hypothesis that the G2 phase is maintained by geminiviruses. It is also suggested that, as KRPs (encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) normally function as a negative regulators of cell division <xref rid="pone.0067534-AgudeloRomero2" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, induction of KRP2 and KRP5 by SACMV at 24 dpi and 14 dpi, respectively, may contribute to M phase repression. The interaction between phytohormone signalling and cell cycle gene pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g007">Figure 7</xref>) illustrates that these pathway genes may be co-ordinately suppressed or induced by geminiviruses when required. Here we suggest that SACMV has a concomitant impact on cell-cycle progression and selected hormones that influence the pathways.</p><p>Certain features that control the cell-cycle are conserved among eukaryotes in order to ensure mitosis does not begin until DNA replication is completed <xref rid="pone.0067534-Andrietta1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Sorrell1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Cyclin-dependent kinases bind to the various cyclin types according the phase of the cycle they are entering, and are responsible for transit through control points in cell-regulation. It is the cyclin which determines the specificity and sub-cellular localization, as it is the regulatory component of the complex and can be classified into G1, S and G2-phases <xref rid="pone.0067534-Andrietta1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Sorrell1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. In addition, CDKs are also regulated by interacting proteins and posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067534-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0067534-Andrietta1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In general, G1 to S transition phases are controlled by CDK containing D-type cyclins which function to release E2F transcription factors in order for transcription of genes necessary for G1 to S transition to occur. They do this by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RBR) <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067534-Andrietta1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. It was demonstrated that CaLCuV-infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells only pass through the early G1 phase since genes such as CYCD1;1 and CYCD3;2 were down-regulated <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Differentially expressed core cell cycle genes detected in the SACMV-<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> array were not always picked up in the CaLCuV-<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hybridization. However a comparison between differentially regulated gene expression between the two geminiviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067534.s006">Table S6</xref>) showed some similarities. While CYCD1;1 was not detected in the SACMV study, CYCD3;2 was also reduced by SACMV at 14 dpi (&#x02212;1.38) and at 24 dpi (&#x02212;1.15), indicating it is likely that geminivirus-infected cells only transit through late G1 <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Additionally, late G1 cyclin CYCD4;2 was induced by both SACMV and CaLCuV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067534.s006">Table S6</xref>). CaLCuV AC1 binding to RBR causes changes to E2F (E2FA and E2FC) expression by bypassing the G1 phase leading to induction of the endocycle. CYCD3&#x02019;s normal function is to promote the mitotic cycle and prevent endocycle <xref rid="pone.0067534-AscencioIbanez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, down-regulation of CYCD&#x02019;s prevent the mitotic cycle from taking place. In addition, genes such as CYCD3;1, CYCD3;2, and CYCD3;3 mutants showed severe symptoms at 12 dpi in CaLCuV suggesting that CaLCuV replicates in endocycling cells. In this study, SACMV infection led to a similar response compared with CaLCuV, as down regulation of CYCD3;1, CYCD3;2 and CYCD3;3 was persistent at 14 and 24 dpi.</p><p>The above listed similarities in cell cycle regulation which occur upon biotic stresses such as CalCuV and SACMV infection provided some insight into what is required for geminiviruses to establish a replication-efficient environment, and in addition, similarities shown between abiotic stresses, such as IR induction, confirms that certain cell-cycle regulators are conserved, as previously suggested in other studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4c3"><title>Comparison of data between SACMV and the monopartite geminivirus <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV)</title><p>In a comparative investigation of gene expression changes induced by TYLCV in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>

Many of these genes were shown to have either no effect on infection by TYLCV, or were involved in promotion of earlier infection or in a delay or reduction of infection.

Histone 3 K4-specific methyltransferase and the putative transcriptional activator with NAC domain protein (ATAF1) have been shown to interact with monopartite geminiviral proteins, namely TrAP/C2 and C3, respectively, while the scarecrow-like protein has been found to be a transcription factor, and overexpressed in phloem <xref rid="pone.0067534-Vilaine1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.

According to the TYLCSV study by Lozano-Dur&#x000e1;n et al. 2011 <xref rid="pone.0067534-LozanoDuran1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 8 of the 18 differentially expressed genes involved in protein modifications, were associated with ubiquitination, acetylation, protein folding, phosphorylation and rubylation, four of which were involved in ubiquitination (UBA1, RHF2A, ASK2, and CSN3). UBA1 was found to be down-regulated by SACMV at 24 dpi (&#x02212;1.21). This gene is involved in many levels of plant defense, one of which is virus resistance. Down-regulation of this gene by both a monopartite and bipartite geminivirus, TYLCSV and SACMV, respectively, favours the proposal that a geminiviral protein interaction, C2 protein in the case of TYLCSV, inhibits UBA1-mediated ubiquitination of possible viral proteins or host protein(s) linked to a resistance-associated response, which would favour progression of infection. Silencing of UBA1 resulted in early TYLCSV infection, supporting this theory. RFH2A was also silenced by TYLCSV, prolonging virus infection, and this gene was also found to be repressed by SACMV at 14 dpi (&#x02212;1.21) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067534-t003">Table 3</xref>) confirming its likely role in sustaining virus infection.

Genes identified in biotic stress responses (RD21, GLO1, and PLP2) upon TYLCSV infection were also induced by SACMV at 14 dpi and/or 24 dpi, demonstrating that geminiviruses, in addition to RNA plant viruses in general <xref rid="pone.0067534-Whitham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, initiate basal innate plant defense responses, and that this is not unique to a particular group of pathogens. AOC1, involved in JA biosynthesis was differentially expressed at all 3 time points upon SACMV infection [up-regulated at 14 dpi (1.28) and down-regulated at 24 dpi (&#x02212;1.87) and 36 dpi (&#x02212;3.05)], but up-regulation early in infection (14 dpi) suggests an early non-specific JA-associated broad defense host response, as discussed previously.

Of the HSP&#x02019;s (HSP70 and HSP90) showing chaperone activity in the Agudelo-Romero et al. 2008 TEV study <xref rid="pone.0067534-Sorrell1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, one of the HSP&#x02019;s (HSP70,AT3G12580) in particular was also identified in our SACMV-<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> study, but showed opposite expression. HSP70 (AT3G12580) was up-regulated by TEV and down-regulated by SACMV (&#x02212;1.98 at 14dpi, and &#x02212;2.36 at 24dpi). This finding, again supports the earlier suggestion that HSP70 may play different roles at different times in virus-infected plants and that differential regulation of HSP&#x02019;s is not always a general stress response but may be specifically targeted by a geminivirus at a particular stage of infection for its own benefit, for example replication or cell-to-cell movement, where HSP70 family chaperones may well be exploited in general folding of movement protein-nucleic acid complexes <xref rid="pone.0067534-Boevink1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, or regulation of host defenses directly or indirectly through interactions with J-domain proteins <xref rid="pone.0067534-Kanzaki1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. It has been suggested that one of the replicase, movement or 16-KDa proteins encoded by RNA1 of <italic>Pea early browning virus</italic> (PEBV) was possibly the elicitor for induction of HSP70 expression <xref rid="pone.0067534-Escaler1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. If this is the case, we suggest that if a movement protein is capable of eliciting HSP&#x02019;s (in particular HSP70) then it is also capable of suppressing HSP expression which is evident with significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) down-regulated HSP&#x02019;s identified at a log2 fold cut-off in SACMV infection. Down-regulation of HSPs was also maintained across the 36 day infection period. We think it not unreasonable to argue that down regulation may be mediated by SACMV in order to suppress innate immune responses, and redirect cellular pathways for its own replication and movement, and also suggest that some geminiviruses may not have an absolute requirement for heat shock for infection progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the large number of genes unveiled in this study provided valuable insight into the little that is known about geminivirus-host interactions. The GO results in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that plant virus stress leads to a transition from normal host growth processes to altered metabolic pathways geared for defense responses. Both similarities and differences were identified between SACMV and the geminiviruses, CaLCuV in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and TYLCV in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, and other RNA viruses, identifying general as well as virus-specific responses in a host. Importantly, we also demonstrate that different altered gene profiles occur at early, middle and late infection stages, and that a limited number of genes are differentially expressed across the entire infection period. Differences between geminiviruses in the same host, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, demonstrate that many host responses in a compatible interaction are geminivirus-specific, and differences in expression patterns may in part be a reflection of different adaptation and evolutionary histories of the viruses and their hosts. This is supported by the comparative microarray study of Arabidopsis, where, while some overlap in altered expression between different viruses in this host occurred, virus-host interactions were essentially unique <xref rid="pone.0067534-Postinova1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It is evident that many host defense layers exist which viruses need to overcome in order to establish successful infection. The suppressive nature of SACMV on many host genes revealed that in a compatible interaction, basal defences are induced but are not capable of inhibiting viral replication and spread, as demonstrated by the progressive increase in symptom severity, virus titre and high number of repressed genes over the infection period. Identifying gene interactions in signalling pathways is a step closer toward identifying master transcription factors controlling these networks. A more systems biology approach will be adopted in further studies to connect these networks. Host-responsive genes may also be grouped or clustered based on their co-expression pattern or chromosomal location, and this also needs to be investigated. Functional testing of candidate genes and transcription factors through a reverse genetics approach, RNA silencing, VIGS and miRNA studies, will also be the next step in expanding on our knowledge of geminivirus-host interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0067534.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
