    "BACKGROUND: Water deficiency is one of the most serious worldwide problems for agriculture. Recently, it has become more serious and outspread, which urgently requires the production of drought-tolerant plants. Microarray experiments using mRNA from air-dried leaves and roots of rice were performed in an attempt to study genes involved in acute dehydration response. RESULTS: Set of 10,537 rice genes was significantly up- or down-regulated in leaves or roots under the treatment. Gene Ontology analysis highlighted gene expression during acute dehydration response depending on organ types and the duration of stress. Rice responded by down-regulating many processes which are mainly involved in inhibiting growth and development. On the other hand, phytohormones (ABA, cytokinin, brassinosteroid) and protective molecules were induced to answer to multiple stresses. Leaves induced more genes than roots but those genes were scattered in various processes, most significantly were productions of osmoprotectants and precursors for important pathways in roots. Roots up-regulated fewer genes and focused on inducing antioxidants and enhancing photosynthesis. Myb, zf-C3HC4, and NAM were most strongly affected transcription factors with the dominance of leaf over root. CONCLUSIONS: Leaf and root tissues shared some common gene expression during stress, with the purpose of enhancing protective systems. However, these two tissues appeared to act differently in response to the different level of dehydration they experience. Besides, they can affect each other via the signaling and transportation system."
