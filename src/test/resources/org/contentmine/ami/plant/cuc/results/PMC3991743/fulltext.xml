Previous studies have revealed that the miR164 family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is comprised of three members which guide the cleavage of the mRNAs of five NAC genes to modulate developmental processes. However, the functions of the miR164-targeted NAC genes in crops are poorly deciphered. In this study, the conserved features of six miR164-targeted NAC genes (<italic>OMTN1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>OMTN6</italic>) in rice are described, and evidence is provided that four of them confer a negative regulatory role in drought resistance. OMTN proteins have the characteristics of typical NAC transcriptional factors. The miR164 recognition sites of the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes are highly conserved in rice germplasms. Deletion of the recognition sites impaired the transactivation activity, indicating that the conserved recognition sites play a crucial role in maintaining the function of the OMTN proteins. The <italic>OMTN</italic> genes were responsive to abiotic stresses, and showed diverse spatio-temporal expression patterns in rice. Overexpression of <italic>OMTN2</italic>, <italic>OMTN3</italic>, <italic>OMTN4</italic>, and <italic>OMTN6</italic> in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage.

Compared with the ample studies reporting the roles of miRNAs and their targets in the morphogenesis and development of plants, much less has been reported about the roles of miRNAs and their targets in the environmental stress responses of plants. Abiotic stress seriously influences plant growth and development, and reduces crop yields worldwide. An enhanced understanding of the miRNA-guided regulation mechanisms responsible for abiotic stress adaptation may help unveil the regulatory networks of stress response and adaptation, and it may also help in designing new strategies to engineer plants with improved stress tolerance.</p><p content-type="indent">Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs and their targets may serve as the main governing factors in response to various stresses, encompassing drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated stress, nutrient homeostasis, UV-B radiation, hypoxia and oxidative stress, and even mechanical stress (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Fujii <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Reyes and Chua, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Jia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Xin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).

To date, nine genes have been considered as putative miR164 targets in rice. Six of them are NAC genes, of which the target sites are located downstream of the conserved NAC domain. The remaining targets include two genes encoding phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase and one encoding a phytosulphokine precursor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru072/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online), and the target sites are located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR and CDS region of the genes, respectively. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miR164 family consists of three members, whereas the miR164 family in rice is composed of six members. Consequently, it is hardly surprising that the number of miR164 targets in rice is more than that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Interestingly, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miR164 targets are all NAC genes, and they are mainly involved in the regulation of organ architecture and the development of lateral roots. Yet, the present study suggests that the miR164 targets include not only NAC genes, but also two other types of genes in rice. The NAC targets of miR164 in rice appear to be associated with the response to abitotic stresses. This study revealed the differences in the numbers, gene types, as well as the biological functions of the miR164 targets between dicot (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) and monocot (rice) plants. To date, investigations on rice miR164 and their targets are rather rare. Clarifying the biological functions of the miR164 targets will help uncover the function of miR164 in crops. Furthermore, it will help us obtain a better understanding of the functional conservation and diversity of miRNAs and their targets between dicot and monocot plants.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>The miR164-targeted sites of the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes were highly conserved</title><p>Recently, more and more plant miRNAs and their targets have been explored by bioinformatics tools and improved molecular biology techniques. However, the natural sequence variation in the mature miRNAs and their targets was seldom reported. Sequence analysis of 92 mature miR164 sequences from 24 plant species suggested that most of the mature sequences were identical. Three out of six rice miR164 family members (miR164a, miR164b, and miR164f) have exactly the same mature sequence, and 1&#x02013;2 nucleotide differences are found in the mature sequences of the other three members. The miR164 recognition sites of the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes were further checked in 158 rice varieties representing a mini-core collection of rice germplasm. Comparative sequencing results revealed that the miR164 key recognition sites in the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes are fairly conserved in the 158 rice varieties which were tested. A few SNPs were found to exist within the target sites, but most of them do not affect the recognition between miR164 and the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes. The evolutionary conservation suggested that the target sites may have important functions. Further research showed that deletion of the target sites abolished or impaired the transactivation activities of the OMTNs in yeast, implying an essential role for the target sites for maintaining the normal functions of the OMTN proteins. Further illuminating the biological function of the target sites will reveal the significance of the high conservation of the target sites during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>OMTNs negatively regulate drought resistance in rice</title><p>Current research on miR164 targets in plants mostly focuses on their roles in regulating developmental processes. To date it has not been reported that the miR164 targets are involved in abiotic stress responses. It was noticed here that most of the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes exhibited abiotic stress-responsive expression patterns in the rice seedling cDNA microarray, which implied roles for the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes in responding to abiotic stresses. The results of drought stress testing at the reproductive stage showed that overexpressing <italic>OMTN2</italic>, <italic>OMTN3</italic>, <italic>OMTN4</italic>, and <italic>OMTN6</italic> increased the sensitivity of transgenic plants to drought stress to varying degrees at the reproductive stage. The overexpression lines and WT were tested for drought tolerance at other developmental stages, but no significant difference was observed, which suggests that the roles of the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes in regulating drought resistance may be associated with reproductive development.</p><p content-type="indent">To decipher the possible regulatory mechanisms of the increased drought sensitivity of the <italic>OMTN</italic> overexpressors, the genomic expression profiles of the <italic>OMTN</italic>-overexpressing transgenic rice and the WT were compared. The profiling data revealed that a large set of genes were up-regulated or down-regulated in the <italic>OMTN2</italic>-, <italic>OMTN3</italic>-, <italic>OMTN4</italic>-, and <italic>OMTN6</italic>-OE plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>, these up- and down-regulated gene sets could be primarily grouped into &#x0003e;10 categories with similar proportions, including genes related to stress, redox regulation, signalling, metabolism, development, and so on. Significantly more genes were down-regulated than were up-regulated in all of the tested transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Further investigation revealed that most of the genes with transcript abundance significantly decreased in the transgenic plants are responsive to stresses, which correlates with the drought-sensitive phenotype of the transgenic plants which was observed. It is proposed that the increased drought sensitivity of the <italic>OMTN</italic>-OE transgenic plants may be derived from the reduction of many regulatory and functional genes. These regulatory genes include the genes encoding various transcription factors which belong to the zinc finger, NAC, Myb, WRKY, bHLH, and AP2 families; and signalling pathway components including the genes mainly involved in auxin, ethylene, and gibberellin metabolism and signalling; protein kinases, etc. The functional genes category contains the genes whose products are transporters, enzymes mediating ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenging and detoxification, chaperones, proteins related to cell wall synthesis and secondary metabolism, and so forth. The Venn diagram analysis presented a complex crossover relationship of the differentially expressed genes among the <italic>OMTN</italic> overexpressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">C</xref>). Notably, there were 79 down-regulated and 11 up-regulated genes overlapping among all of the transgenic plants. There is evidence that many homologues of these down-regulated genes have roles in response or adaptation to environmental stimuli. For instance, calmodulin-binding protein and calcium-binding EGF domain-containing protein were found to be involved in multiple environmental signalling pathways in plants (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Poovaiah, 2002</xref>). Protein kinases have been widely reported with important roles in stress signalling, and are potentially beneficial for plant tolerance engineering (<xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Vinocur and Altman, 2005</xref>). Heat shock proteins (Hsps) function in helping to maintain proper folding and conformation of proteins, thus preventing protein dysfunction and denaturation caused by adverse environmental conditions (W. <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Detoxication enzymes such as peroxidase, oxidoreductase, and multicopper oxidase were documented to alleviate the oxidative damage and confer stress tolerance in plants (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Murgia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Vinocur and Altman, 2005</xref>). Cytochrome P450s were also suggested to take part in a wide range of biochemical pathways and protect plants from the damage caused by various stresses (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Narusaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Moreover, other genes generate products such as heavy metal-associated proteins (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Barth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), flavonoids (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Winkel-Shirley, 2002</xref>), transportors (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Shabala and Cuin, 2008</xref>), and glycosyl transferases (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cheong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) which have been reported to be associated with stress adaption in plants. Interestingly, it was also noticed that some genes whose products were pathogen-related proteins, wall-associated kinases (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Sivaguru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Decreux and Messiaen, 2005</xref>), acidic endochitinase precursors, and NBS-LRR-type disease resistance proteins were also down-regulated in transgenic plants, suggesting that the OMTNs might also be involved in defence responses.

Moreover, the osmiophilic granules were also significantly increased (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru072/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Although the relationship between the changes of the organelles at the microscopic level and the altered phenotypes is unclear, it was assumed that, based on these observations, the <italic>OMTN</italic> genes together with miR164 participate in the regulation of maintenance of organ boundaries and normal development in rice.</p><p content-type="indent">In conclusion, the miR164-targeted NAC genes in rice were characterized for the features of transcription factor, conservation of the miR164 recognition sites, and stress responsiveness. Overexpressing <italic>OMTN2</italic>, <italic>OMTN3</italic>, <italic>OMTN4</italic>, and <italic>OMTN6</italic> in rice significantly decreased drought resistance at the reproductive stage, revealing that the OMTNs have novel functions as negative regulators of drought resistance in rice, in addition to the conserved roles in regulating the developmental processes as reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s26"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
