attachment of perfluoroalkyl groups onto organic compounds
has been a major synthetic goal over the past several decades. Previously,
our group reported phenanthroline-ligated perfluoroalkyl copper reagents,
(phen)CuR<sub>F</sub>, which react with aryl iodides and aryl boronates
to form the corresponding benzotrifluorides. Herein the perfluoroalkylation
of a series of heteroaryl bromides with (phen)CuCF<sub>3</sub> and
(phen)CuCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> is reported. The mild reaction
conditions allow the process to tolerate many common functional groups.
Perfluoroethylation with (phen)CuCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> occurs in somewhat higher yields than trifluoromethylation
with (phen)CuCF<sub>3</sub>, creating a method to generate fluoroalkyl
heteroarenes that are less accessible from trifluoroacetic acid
derivatives.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ol500422t</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ol-2014-00422t</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The trifluoromethyl group is
present in numerous pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials.
As a result, there has been considerable interest in developing practical
reactions to incorporate perfluoroalkyl groups into organic compounds
under mild conditions. In medicinal and agrochemistry, the introduction
of a trifluoromethyl group can lead to increases in activity and stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The top selling drugs fluoxetine (Prozac) and
mefloquine (Lariam) and the leading agrochemical fluazinam contain
CF<sub>3</sub> groups (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Bioactive compounds

with HF or SbF<sub>5</sub>, remains the most prevalent method for
the industrial-scale synthesis of trifluoromethyl arenes and certain
heteroarenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit2a">2a</xref></sup> Although this method is
effective in the bulk production of simple benzotrifluorides,
its utility on the laboratory scale for the synthesis of complex molecules
and late-stage functionalization is limited by the low functional
group compatibility and toxic reagents. Furthermore, the Swarts reaction
cannot be applied to the synthesis of longer-chain perfluoroalkyl
moieties, such as the C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub> group.</p><p>Although
there has been considerable progress in copper-mediated
perfluoroalkylation reactions in recent years, these reactions are
mostly limited to aryl iodide and arylboron substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Perfluoroalkylation reactions of aryl bromides,
which are more commercially and synthetically available than aryl
iodides, have been limited to substrates containing electron-withdrawing
groups. A single report for the trifluoromethylation of aryl
chlorides with Pd has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> However,
these reactions require an expensive palladium precatalyst, ligand,
and CF<sub>3</sub> source. Most relevant to our current work, the
majority of the current methods have not been demonstrated to be applicable
to the synthesis of fluoroalkyl <italic>hetero</italic>arenes with
significant scope. This limitation is important because of the prevalence
of heteroarenes in medicinal and agrochemistry.</p><p>The difference
in availability of aryl iodides and bromides is
even greater for heteroaryl halides. There are only about one-fifth
as many commercially available iodopyridines compared to bromopyridines,
and the price of 2-iodopyridine is nearly 40 times higher than that
of 2-bromopyridine per mole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> A Reaxys
search shows that there are also twice as many procedures to synthesize
any bromopyridine isomer compared to procedures to synthesize the
corresponding iodopyridines.</p><p>Grushin has recently reported the
perfluoroalkylation of
heteroaryl bromides with CuCF<sub>3</sub> formed by the direct cupration
of HCF<sub>3</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit5a">5a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit5b">5b</xref></sup> Although the functional group
tolerance and yields of this method are high, the CuCF<sub>3</sub> reagent cannot be stored.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit5c">5c</xref></sup> Thus, each
reaction must be initiated by generation of CuCF<sub>3</sub> from
gaseous HCF<sub>3</sub>, and such a transformation is challenging
to conduct in common laboratory settings.</p><p>Methods for the radical
trifluoromethylation of heteroarenes
have also been reported recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> While
these methods do not require prefunctionalized substrates, the yields
and regioselectivities of these reactions are often modest, and limited
functional group compatibility has been demonstrated. Thus, methods
for the synthesis of fluoroalkylheteroarenes from heteroaryl
bromides with easily handled reagents that occur with broad scope
and complete site selectivity are desirable.</p><p>Our group recently
reported the trifluoromethylation of aryl iodides
with a phenanthroline&#x02013;CuCF<sub>3</sub> complex, (phen)CuCF<sub>3</sub> (<bold>1</bold>) (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit7a">7a</xref></sup> This thermally stable, commercially available
solid reacts with a variety of aryl iodides and electron-deficient
aryl bromides under mild conditions. We also showed that aryl bromides
can be converted to trifluoromethylarenes indirectly by
initial conversion to arylboronate esters, followed by a reaction
of the boronate with <bold>1</bold> in air.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit7b">7b</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Synthesis of perfluoroalkyl heteroarenes.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ol-2014-00422t_0003" id="gr5" position="float"/></fig><p>Because <bold>1</bold> was shown to react with
electron-deficient <italic>aryl</italic> bromides, we considered that <bold>1</bold> would react
similarly with <italic>hetero</italic>aryl bromides that are inherently
more electron-deficient than the corresponding arenes, such as pyridines
and diazines. However, reactions of CuCF<sub>3</sub> reagents with
bromopyridines could be challenging because pyridines can bind to
the metal center and alter the inherent reactivity. Moreover, bromopyridines
are less reactive toward oxidative addition than iodopyridines, and
the oxidative addition step is likely the rate-limiting step for reactions
with copper centers containing electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl
groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> We hypothesized that the chelating
phen ligand in preformed <bold>1</bold> would minimize bonding of
the pyridine to the copper center, in addition to rendering the copper
complex isolable and easy to handle. Herein, we report that copper
complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> react with a range of
heteroaryl bromides to form perfluoroalkylheteroarenes
in good yields. The reactivity and functional group compatibility
for the reaction of bromopyridines with <bold>1</bold> is higher than
those of prior methods for the fluoroalkylation of heteroarenes.</p><p>Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref> shows a comparison of the yield
for the trifluoromethylation of methyl 6-bromopicolinate,
a representative bromopyridine containing a potentially reactive ester.
Although the 2-position is activated, the prior methods reported for
trifluoromethylation generate the 2-trifluoromethylpyridine
in low to modest yield. In contrast, the reaction of this bromopyridine
with <bold>1</bold> occurs in essentially quantitative yield.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of Copper-Mediated Trifluoromethylations

5-position, but the product from trifluoromethylation at both the
2- and 5-position formed in 15% yield. No product was observed corresponding
to trifluoromethylation at the 5-position alone. 2-Chloropyridines
and pyrimidines were also investigated for their reactivity toward <bold>1</bold>. However, low yields (5&#x02013;20%) of the trifluoromethylated
products were obtained from the heteroaryl chlorides.</p><p>Pyridines
containing bromine at the 4-position were less reactive
than those containing bromine at the 2-position. High yields were
observed when the bromoheteroarene contained electron-withdrawing
groups (<bold>3ac</bold>&#x02013;<bold>ae</bold>). The product of trifluoromethylation
was obtained in modest yield from 4-bromopyridines bearing electron-donating
groups (<bold>4aa</bold>, <bold>4ab</bold>).</p><p>3-Bromopyridines
were less reactive toward this process than 2-
and 4-bromopyridines, but synthetically useful amounts of the 3-trifluoromethylpyridines
did form. We presume the lower reactivity is due to the greater electron
density at the 3-position of pyridines than at the 2- and 4-positions,
making them more akin to bromoarenes and less prone to undergo oxidative
addition to the Cu(I) reagent. Consistent with this assertion, the
reactions of 3-bromopyridines required heating at a higher temperature
(100 &#x000b0;C) than the reactions with 2-bromopyridines (80 &#x000b0;C).
The trifluoromethylation of 3-bromopyridines containing
electron-donating substituents (<bold>3x</bold>, <bold>3y</bold>)
afforded products in modest yields. However, the trifluoromethylation
of 3-bromopyridines containing electron-withdrawing substituents
(<bold>3s</bold>&#x02013;<bold>w</bold>) formed the products in good
yields. Thus, this simple reaction provides a method to form a range
of 3-trifluoromethylpyridine derivatives.</p><p>To enhance
the reactivity of 3-bromopyridines toward <bold>1</bold>, we
tested several changes to the reaction conditions (see
Table S1 in the <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>).
However, changes to the temperature, equivalents of <bold>1</bold>, reaction time, concentration, ligand, and solvent had little effect
on the yield. Catalytic quantities of Lewis acids to bind to pyridine
and decrease electron density at the 3-position led to no reaction.
Reactions of the corresponding pyridine-<italic>N</italic>-oxide and <italic>N</italic>-(TBS)pyridinium triflate formed the trifluoromethylpyridine
derivatives in trace quantities. We are continuing to investigate
methods to increase the reactivity of electron-rich 3-bromopyridines
toward <bold>1</bold>.</p><p>The scope of the trifluoromethylation
reaction with <bold>1</bold> encompassed reactions with other brominated
nitrogen heterocycles
(Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref>). For example, 2- and 5-bromopyrimidines
reacted with <bold>1</bold> to form the corresponding trifluoromethylpyrimidines
in good yield (<bold>6a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold>).

benzimidazole (<bold>5l</bold>), and benzoxazole (<bold>5k</bold>)
formed the trifluoromethylated products in good to high yield.
Brominated caffeine was also transformed to the trifluoromethylated

demonstrating the applicability of this method for the large-scale
trifluoromethylation of complex heterocyclic substrates. Finally,
the nucleoside derivative <bold>5n</bold> underwent trifluoromethylation
in high yield. Reactions of 2-bromofurans and 2-bromothiophenes
also were explored, but only low yields of the trifluoromethylation
product were obtained. Furthermore, unprotected N&#x02013;H derivatives
