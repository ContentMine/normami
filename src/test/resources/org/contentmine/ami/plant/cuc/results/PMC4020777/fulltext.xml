The net pattern mutation creates breaks in the seed coat of soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) because of ruptured cell walls. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the seed coat transcriptome from three stages of immature seed development in two pairs of isolines with normal or defective seed coat phenotypes due to the net pattern. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of these isolines revealed 364 differentially expressed genes in common between the two varieties that were further divided into different broad functional categories. Genes related to cell wall processes accounted for 19% of the differentially expressed genes in the middle developmental stage of 100&#x02013;200 mg seed weight. Within this class, the cell wall proline-rich and glycine-rich protein genes were highly differentially expressed in both genetic backgrounds. Other genes that showed significant expression changes in each of the isoline pairs at the 100&#x02013;200 mg seed weight stage were xylem serine proteinase, fasciclin-related genes, auxin and stress response related genes, TRANSPARENT TESTA 1 (TT1) and other transcription factors. The mutant appears to shift the timing of either the increase or decrease in the levels of some of the transcripts. The analysis of these data sets reveals the physiological changes that the seed coat undergoes during the formation of the breaks in the cell wall.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research was funded by support from the United Soybean Board and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The cell walls differ in composition in different plant parts but the basic composition of the cell wall includes cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, and small proportions of structural proteins including proline-rich and glycine-rich proteins. The seed coat is the outer protective layer of a seed and develops from the integument originally surrounding the ovule and is maternal in origin. The seed coat provides protection of embryo and endosperm from mechanical injuries, insects, bacteria, and fungi, and desiccation of the seed. Seed coats of different species vary in structure and composition including extensive differentiation of cell layers into specialized cell types. These cells may accumulate large quantities of substances including mucilage or pigments depending on plant species.</p><p>The seed coat, or testa, of the mature soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) has been well characterized, and contains features in common with the majority of the legumes: an epidermal layer of palisade cells, or macrosclereids, a sub-epidermal layer of hourglass cells, or osteosclereids, a few layers of parenchyma, and an aleurone layer <xref rid="pone.0096342-Corner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096342-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096342-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Soybean seeds begin to form on the plant at the R4 stage when the parent plant has between 13 and 20 leaf nodes <xref rid="pone.0096342-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. At this stage, the seed is going through multiple cycles of cell division as well as tissue differentiation. Invertase in the seed coat cleaves sucrose giving rise to hexose which surrounds the embryo of the minuscule soybean seed <xref rid="pone.0096342-Bewley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The seeds grow at a rapid rate between the R4 and R7 stages as they accumulate carbon, nitrogen, and seed storage proteins. Seeds increase in size from 25 mg to 500 mg fresh weight during the R5 and R6 stages. Towards the end of the R6 stage, nutrient accumulation in the seed begins to decrease. By R7 the seed has amassed almost all the dry weight it will acquire and contains approximately 60% moisture and has begun to yellow. After reaching the maximum fresh weight, near 400&#x02013;500 mg, the seed readies itself for desiccation and begins to lose total fresh weight. By the R8 stage, most of the pods and seeds have browned and are dry <xref rid="pone.0096342-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Intact seed coats are preferred but a mutation known as the &#x0201c;net pattern&#x0201d; in soybean results in defective seed coats that have ruptured by maturity to expose the cotyledons underneath. The trait has been backcrossed to create isolines in two different genetic backgrounds; however, very little is known about the histology or molecular nature of the trait. Using RNA blots, we have previously reported a developmental delay in the decline of transcripts for a specific proline-rich protein (PRP1) of the cell wall leading to higher levels of this transcript in the defective seed coats at the middle weight range of 100&#x02013;200 mg seed weight <xref rid="pone.0096342-Percy1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The effect on PRP1 transcript levels was assumed to be a downstream effect of the net pattern mutation. In this report, we present the global gene expression analysis of the net pattern cell wall mutant in soybean using transcriptome analyses of three different stages of seed development at 50&#x02013;100 mg, 100&#x02013;200 mg, and 400&#x02013;500 mg. By comparing RNA-Seq data from the two lines containing the defective seed coat trait compared to their standard counterpart isolines using Bowtie alignments <xref rid="pone.0096342-Langmead1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to the soybean genes models from the sequenced soybean genome <xref rid="pone.0096342-Schmutz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 364 significantly differentially expressed genes in common between the two isolines were revealed, many of which were involved in cell wall processes.

These two Glyma models were called as &#x0201c;low confidence&#x0201d; gene models with no annotation by the Glyma gene model version 1.0 at the Phytozome database and as extensin-related genes in Glyma model version 1.1, whereas the non-redundant database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) annotated them as proline-rich proteins. We conducted manual annotations in the following manner to confirm them as the classically defined soybean PRP1 and PRP2 genes which are in NCBI. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of PRP1 from NCBI (J02746) showed 100% match with Glyma09g12200.1 from the soybean genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096342.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and the nucleotide sequence of SbPRP2 gene from NCBI (J05208) showed 98.8% similarity with Glyma09g12260.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096342.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

Some of the differential expression may be a temporal shift in developmental appearances of transcripts. Notably, in the case of the TT1 homolog, it appears that the decline in its transcript levels was delayed in the defective seed coats relative to the standard seed coats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096342-g006">Figure 6</xref>), thus leading to significant differential expression at the 100&#x02013;200 mg seed weight range. This profile is similar to the pattern exhibited by the PRP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) in that its decline in expression appears to be slowed. Thus, a developmental delay in the normal expression patterns of multiple genes appeared to be a feature of the effect of this mutation as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096342.s006">Figures S6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096342.s010">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096342.s014">S14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096342.s015">S15</xref>. These shifts may be one of the reasons for significant differential expression at the mid-seed weight range of 100&#x02013;200 mg and may indicate that the triggering event occurs at or before the 50 mg seed weight range.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Summary</title><p>We present an overview of genes whose expression was affected by the &#x0201c;net pattern&#x0201d; mutation in soybean. Two isolines of different genetic backgrounds were used to understand physiology related to this mutation that causes defective cracks in the seed coats. Twelve samples representing three stages of seed coat development from each of the four lines were subjected to the power of next-generation sequencing to obtain millions of transcript reads that were mapped to all 78,773 high and low confidence gene models of <italic>Glycine max</italic>. There were approximately 1300 significantly differentially expressed genes affected by this mutation in each isoline pair with 364 in common between the two isolines of different genetic backgrounds. The cell wall structural protein genes including proline-rich proteins (PRP1 and PRP2) and glycine-rich proteins were among the transcripts affected by the mutation as well as a number of transcription factors. Some of the transcript patterns indicate that a developmental shift in timing of gene expression underpins the differential gene expression changes at mid-maturation as shown by graphical presentation of expression patterns for 82 out of 364 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in both the Clark and Harosoy backgrounds. In summary, the mutation appears to set in motion a complex series of events, many manifested at the transcript level, that lead to changes in physiology and ultimately structure of the cell wall. The information on potential candidate genes for this mutation and the regulated genes will not only be helpful in understanding cell wall physiology in soybean, but could also provide a platform for improvement in bioenergy crops like sorghum, maize and <italic>Miscanthus</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Materials and Genetic Nomenclature</title><p>The isolines of <italic>Glycine max</italic> used in this study were a black seeded Clark line, Clark defective seed coat, Harosoy standard and Harosoy defective seed coat.
