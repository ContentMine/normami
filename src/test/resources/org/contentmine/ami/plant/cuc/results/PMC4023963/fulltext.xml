Nearly 20% of irrigated agricultural land is under quite serious threats of salinization, and the problem of soil salinity is continuously increasing <xref rid="pone.0097878-Flowers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. High salt concentrations impose both ionic and osmotic stresses, coupled with secondary stresses such as oxidative stress and nutritional disorders in most plants <xref rid="pone.0097878-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is essential for regulating ion homeostasis in the cytoplasm and for tolerance of salt stress <xref rid="pone.0097878-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. High concentrations of salts in the soil reduce the uptake of water by the roots. Plant responses to salinity are associated with osmotic regulation mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0097878-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There are several signal transduction pathways linked to high salinity, both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent. In the ABA-dependent pathway, several transcription factors (TFs) response to stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including AREB/ABFs (ABA responsive element-binding factors), MYB2, MYC2, and RD26 (responsive to desiccation 26, ANAC072) <xref rid="pone.0097878-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the ABA-independent pathways, DREB2s (dehydration response element-binding protein 2), NAC (<underline>N</underline>AM, <underline>A</underline>TAF1/2, <underline>C</underline>UC2) and HD-ZIP (homeodomain leucine zipper protein) are important transcription factors associated with responses to dehydration and high salinity <xref rid="pone.0097878-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The relationship between the ethylene signaling pathway and salt stress has also been established. TFs NAC2 and ERF4 (ethylene-responsive transcription factor 4) affect root structure and regulate other physiological pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0097878-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097878-He1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, functional genes employed in carbohydrate and osmolyte metabolism, water and metal transportation, and reactive oxygen species scavenging has proved to play crucial roles in keeping osmotic homeostasis and detoxification under salt stress <xref rid="pone.0097878-Hasegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Transcriptomic analysis has proved to be highly valuable for analyzing plant genome expression profiles under a wide range of developmental and environmental conditions, and the results has revealed many common responses to salinity. A large number of transcriptome profiling studies on plants exposed to salt stress have been conducted such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>

Most of the salt-responsive genes identified are involved in transport, production of osmoprotectants, detoxification, primary energy metabolism and hormone related signal transduction processes. Using genetic engineering, a number of salt responsive genes can improve the plant salinity tolerance <xref rid="pone.0097878-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The physic nut (<italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> L.) is a small perennial tree or large shrub, which belongs to the specie of Euphorbiaceae. It is planted as potential crops for biofuel production <xref rid="pone.0097878-Achten1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Previous studies showed young physic nut seedlings were sensitive to high salt condition <xref rid="pone.0097878-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but the molecular mechnism is not clear. The 100 mM NaCl can induces a moderate stress response but is not acutely lethal <xref rid="pone.0097878-daSilva2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097878-daSilva3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Indeed, in our pre-experiment, we observed visible signs with the leaf chlorosis and defoliation after the treatment (data not shown). Based on the recent sequencing of its genome and the development of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries by our group (unpublished) and other groups <xref rid="pone.0097878-Natarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097878-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it is a valuable plant for studying the mechanisms of responses to salinity. In the study described herein, we investigated transcriptomic changes in physic nut roots and leaves exposed to 100 mM NaCl by using next-generation sequencing-based digital gene expression tag profiling. The current paper provides an overview of the transcriptome of physic nut plants exposed to salt stress, and this would be useful for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying salt response in plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>No specific permits were required for the field studies described because the experimental site is owned by South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Key Laboratory of Plant Resources Conservation and Sustainable Utilization undertook the management.

The group irrigated with Hoagland nutrient solution was regarded as control.</p><p>Based on the change of net photosynthesis rate (Pn) of the physic nut leaves under salt stress, treated and untreated seedlings at three points were sampled. They were the early point (2 h after the start of the stress treatment); the point of rapid reduction of Pn stage (2 d after the start of the stress treatment, Pn decreased to 83% of the control), and the point of relatively stable net photosynthesis rate stage (7 d after the start of the stress treatment, Pn maintained about half of the control). Root samples comprised all root tips ca. 5&#x02013;10 mm long, while leaf samples comprised blades of the third fully expanded leaf from the apex.

The glutathione-ascorbate cycle is one of the most important antioxidant protection systems for removing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in cell organelles <xref rid="pone.0097878-Foyer1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097878-Chew1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The expression of genes encoding several enzymes in this cycle was upregulated in physic nut plants under salt stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097878.s008">Table S8</xref>). Flavonoids have antioxidant functions in higher plants <xref rid="pone.0097878-Agati1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097878-Brunetti1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In this study, several genes that take part in flavonoids biosynthesis were upregulated at 7 d after the onset of salt stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097878.s008">Table S8</xref>). This result suggests that flavonoids may have antioxidant functions in physic nut under the salt stress. Salt stress affects plants photosynthesis, which is induced primarily by the osmotic effects of salt excess in roots. Previous studies showed significant reduction in net photosynthesis rate of physic nut exposed to salt stress <xref rid="pone.0097878-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097878-Silva1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097878-LimaNeto1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. In the current study, photosynthesis related genes were significantly downregulated at 7 d in leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097878.s009">Table S9</xref>). This downregulation may closely associate with inhibition of ROS accumulation in leaves. It also proved the photoprotection mechanism that dissipation of excess photosynthetic energy contributes to salt tolerance <xref rid="pone.0097878-LimaNeto1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.</p><p>Many highly abundant transcripts in mature stage seeds encoding LEAs and HSPs were upregulated in physic nut leaves at 7 d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097878.s008">Table S8</xref>). These proteins function in maintaining cell turgor and cellular redox balance, and the stabilization of proteins and cellular structures, which may enhance the salt tolerance of physic nut. Additionally, several genes involved in proteolysis and ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis were upregulated at 7 d. These proteins are speculated to prevent the aggregation of nascent or damaged proteins <xref rid="pone.0097878-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>.</p><p>Conclusively, we characterized the comprehensive transcriptome of the woody plant physic nut using the Illumina sequencing technology. The genes related to osmolyte synthesis were in different pathways. In roots, the major regulated genes were involved in trehalose synthesis, while in leaves, the major regulated genes were involved in raffinose synthesis. Moreover, a number of genes related to cell wall structure and composition changes in roots and reactive oxygen scavenger in leaves were responded. There may be other mechanisms in physic nut response to salt stress under different treatment condition, which need to be studied in future. This transcriptome data could provide significant insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern the response to salt stress in physic nut, and may provide a new resource for genetic engineering of salt tolerance in physic nut or other crops.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097878.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
