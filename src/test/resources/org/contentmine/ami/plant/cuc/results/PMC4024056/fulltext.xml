Even so, the radiological protection still represents a subject of regulatory concern. In plants, few reports dealing with the effects of &#x003b3;-rays, in terms of dose rate (rate of energy deposition) and total dose (energy absorbed per unit mass), are available. In addition, plants are known to be more radioresistant than animals. The use of ionizing radiations for studying various aspects of transcription regulation may help elucidate some of the unanswered questions regarding DNA repair in plants. Under these premises, microRNAs have emerged as molecules involved in gene regulation in response to various environmental conditions as well as in other aspects of plant development. Currently, no report on the changes in microRNAs expression patterns in response to &#x003b3;-ray treatments exists in plants, even if this subject is extensively studies in human cells. The present study deals with the expression profiles of three miRNAs, namely osa-miR414, osa-miR164e and osa-miR408 and their targeted helicase genes (<italic>OsABP</italic>, <italic>OsDBH</italic> and <italic>OsDSHCT</italic>) in response to different doses of &#x003b3;-rays delivered both at low and high dose rates. The irradiated rice seeds were grown both in the presence of water and 100 mM NaCl solution. DNA damage and reactive species accumulation were registered, but no dose- or time-dependent expression was observed in response to these treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd><italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-ray</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>helicases</kwd><kwd>microRNAs</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>relative expression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Radiological protection of plants and animals in general, is currently a subject of regulatory concern.

In consequence, it can be entailed that they might play some roles in these physiological processes. Furthermore, the presence of various stress-related cis-elements (especially light-responsive elements) in the promoter regions, support for potential roles in plant stress response.

Several RNA helicases were shown to be involved in the response to harmful environmental conditions like cold, heat, salt, drought, ABA, wounding or UV exposure.

No specific dose- or time-dependent expression was observed, however the overall picture potentially shows more induction in response to LDR as compared with HDR. In contrast, this particular field is much better investigated in human cells.
