Leaf senescence is a complex process that is driven by extensive reprogramming of global gene expression in a highly coordinated manner. Understanding how gene regulatory networks involved in controlling leaf senescence are organized and operated is essential to decipher the mechanisms of leaf senescence. It was previously reported that the trifurcate feed-forward pathway involving <italic>EIN2</italic>, <italic>ORE1</italic>, and <italic>miR164</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> regulates age-dependent leaf senescence and cell death. Here, new components of this pathway have been identified, which enhances knowledge of the gene regulatory networks governing leaf senescence. Comparative gene expression analysis revealed six senescence-associated NAC transcription factors (TFs) (ANAC019, AtNAP, ANAC047, ANAC055, ORS1, and ORE1) as candidate downstream components of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2). EIN3, a downstream signalling molecule of EIN2, directly bound the <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic> promoters and induced their transcription. This suggests that EIN3 positively regulates leaf senescence by activating <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic>, previously reported as key regulators of leaf senescence. Genetic and gene expression analyses in the <italic>ore1 atnap</italic> double mutant revealed that ORE1 and AtNAP act in distinct and overlapping signalling pathways. Transient transactivation assays further demonstrated that ORE1 and AtNAP could activate common as well as differential NAC TF targets. Collectively, the data provide insight into an EIN2-mediated senescence signalling pathway that coordinates global gene expression during leaf senescence via a gene regulatory network involving EIN3 and senescence-associated NAC TFs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>EIN2-mediated senescence signalling</kwd><kwd>EIN3</kwd><kwd>gene</kwd><kwd>NAC transcription factor.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leaf senescence is a well-orchestrated and genetically programmed cell death process that constitutes the final stage of leaf development (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). During leaf senescence, cells in a leaf undergo a dramatic transition in cellular metabolism and the degradation of cellular structures in an orderly manner, resulting in the recycling of nutrients to newly developing vegetative and reproductive organs (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Nooden, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Nam, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Leaf senescence proceeds with the age of a leaf; however, it is also influenced by various endogenous factors, including phytohormones, and external environmental factors, such as salt stress, extreme temperatures, and pathogen attack (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Thomas and Stoddart, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Weaver <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Dai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Quirino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Buchanan-Wollaston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Thus, leaf senescence is a very complicated process incorporating multiple developmental and environmental signals, which involves extensive reprogramming and modulation of gene expression.</p><p content-type="indent">Intensive genetic and genomic studies during the past decade have led to major advances in our understanding of leaf senescence at the molecular level. In particular, recent genome-wide transcriptome studies have uncovered a global picture of the leaf senescence process, which involves thousands of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) that are differentially expressed during leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Buchanan-Wollaston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">van der Graaff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Breeze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Given that the expression of &#x0003e;200 transcription factor (TF) genes is altered during leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Buchanan-Wollaston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Balazadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Guo, 2013</xref>) and TFs regulate the transcription of their target genes in a spatiotemporal-specific manner, gene regulatory networks composed of interactions between these TFs and their targets have been implicated in controlling leaf senescence. Indeed, by taking advantage of high-throughput and computational analyses, researchers have begun to identify gene regulatory networks involved in the leaf senescence process. For example, a gene regulatory network model has been reconstructed using selected SAGs from microarray-based temporal expression profiling during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Breeze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The proposed network model predicts the effects of a plant-specific NAC (NAM/ATAF1,2/CUC2) TF, ORESARA1 (ORE1/NAC2/ANAC092), which is known to be one of the central positive regulators of leaf senescence, on the expression of multiple known downstream target genes and several stress-related TFs. <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hickman <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> proposed a gene regulatory network model involving ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072, based on high-throughput yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and time-course gene expression data. Although initial attempts have been made to characterize gene regulatory networks important for leaf senescence, what the gene regulatory network involving TFs important for the control of leaf senescence is composed of and how it is operated have been largely unexplored.</p><p content-type="indent">It was previously reported that the trifurcate feed-forward pathway, which involves ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2/ORE2/ORE3), <italic>miRNA164</italic> (<italic>miR164</italic>), and ORE1, regulates age-dependent leaf senescence and cell death (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). EIN2, a central signalling component required for ethylene responses (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alonso <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), induces <italic>ORE1</italic> in an age-dependent manner. <italic>ORE1</italic> is negatively regulated by <italic>miR164</italic> in young leaves, which is relieved in old leaves due to the age-dependent down-regulation of <italic>miR164</italic> by EIN2. In young <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves, <italic>miR164</italic> suppresses <italic>ORE1</italic>, which positively regulates leaf senescence. However, in old leaves, EIN2 suppresses <italic>miR164</italic> and thereby induces <italic>ORE1</italic> expression, which leads to leaf senescence. Based on the results of mathematical modelling and genetic analyses with the <italic>ein2</italic> and <italic>ore1</italic> mutants, it was further suggested that EIN2 utilizes another pathway that does not include ORE1. Recently, EIN3, a well-known key TF in the EIN2-mediated ethylene signalling cascade (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Chao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), has been shown to be involved in the trifurcate feed-forward pathway of age-dependent senescence and cell death (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). EIN3 induces the accumulation of <italic>ORE1</italic> transcript in an age-dependent manner by directly repressing <italic>miR164</italic> transcription. However, how EIN2-mediated senescence signalling is transduced to ORE1 and how a gene regulatory network involving ORE1 is organized to regulate leaf senescence have not been investigated.</p><p content-type="indent">In this study, novel components in the trifurcate feed-forward pathway were identified and characterized to augment understanding of the composition, organization, and function of the gene regulatory networks that govern leaf senescence. As a first step toward expanding the trifurcate feed-forward pathway for leaf senescence, six senescence-associated NAC TFs were identified, including ORE1 and AtNAP/ANAC029, as candidate downstream targets of EIN2, and whether these NAC TF genes were acting downstream of EIN3 was further examined. Y1H and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that EIN3 directly bound to the promoters of the <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic> genes. Transiently overexpressed <italic>EIN3</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts was sufficient to activate the expression of <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic>. Genetic and gene expression analyses in <italic>ore1 atnap</italic> double mutants revealed that ORE1 and AtNAP have partially additive functions in age-dependent and artificially induced leaf senescence. Using transient transactivation assays, it was further found that ORE1 and AtNAP regulate common as well as distinct NAC TF targets. Based on these data, a plausible model for an EIN2&#x02013;EIN3&#x02013;NAC TF gene regulatory cascade that has an important role in the control of leaf senescence is proposed. Collectively, the data provide insight into how the EIN2-mediated senescence signalling pathway coordinates global gene expression during leaf senescence via a gene regulatory network involving EIN3 and NAC TFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>

Therefore, qRT&#x02013;PCR-based gene expression analysis was employed to identify the NAC TFs that lie downstream of ORE1 and AtNAP.

As a leaf ages, EIN2-mediated senescence signals induce the expression of ORE1, a positive regulator of leaf senescence, and simultaneously suppress the expression of <italic>miR164</italic>, which negatively regulates <italic>ORE1</italic> at the post-transcriptional level. Mathematical modelling and genetic analysis results further suggested the existence of an ORE1-independent pathway activated by EIN2-mediated senescence signals. Recently, EIN3 has been shown to be involved in the trifurcate feed-forward pathway, by directly repressing <italic>miR164</italic> expression (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, of what the gene regulatory network activated by EIN2-mediated senescence signal is composed and how it manages the leaf senescence process remains to be elucidated.</p><p content-type="indent">In this study, new molecular components of the trifurcate feed-forward pathway have been identified and characterized, enhancing understanding of the gene regulatory networks governing the leaf senescence process. New findings on the organization and function of the gene regulatory networks underlying leaf senescence included the following. First, six NAC TFs, including the two master regulators of leaf senescence, ORE1 and AtNAP, were found to participate in the gene regulatory network controlled by EIN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Secondly, it was uncovered that EIN2-mediated senescence signal was transduced into ORE1 and AtNAP through the action of EIN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Furthermore, the data suggest that four additional NAC TFs seem to be mainly regulated by an EIN3-independent pathway(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thirdly, analysis of the downstream targets of ORE1 and AtNAP also provides new insights into how EIN2-mediated senescence signalling is differentially propagated through the key NAC TFs to execute the leaf senescence process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Based on these data, a working model for an EIN2&#x02013;EIN3&#x02013;NAC TFs regulatory cascade with an important role in the control of leaf senescence was proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F8" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>A plausible model for the EIN2&#x02013;EIN3&#x02013;NAC TFs regulatory cascade in the control of leaf senescence. EIN2-mediated senescence signalling, triggered by various senescence-inducing factors including age, hormones, and environmental stresses, activates EIN3. EIN3 directly induces the expression of two key positive regulators of leaf senescence, <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic>. Simultaneously, EIN3 directly suppresses the expression of <italic>miR164</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which negatively regulates <italic>ORE1</italic> at the post-transcriptional level. ORE1 and AtNAP activate the expression of common as well as distinct downstream NAC TF genes. In addition, EIN2-mediated senescence signal is transduced to four NAC TFs (ANAC019, ANAC047, ANAC055, and <italic>ORS1</italic>) via an EIN3-independent pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="exbotj_eru112_f0008"/></fig><sec id="s17"><title>NAC TFs as new components of the gene regulatory network activated by EIN2</title><p>EIN2, a central signalling component required for ethylene responses, has been long known as a master positive regulator of leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Oh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alonso <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), yet the gene regulatory network controlled by EIN2-mediated senescence signal is not fully understood. Here, an attempt was made to identify additional molecular components that act downstream of EIN2, as a first step towards understanding in detail the gene regulatory network activated by the EIN2-mediated senescence signal. In the present study, six NAC TF genes, including <italic>ORE1</italic>, <italic>AtNAP</italic>, and <italic>ANAC055</italic>, were found to be controlled by <italic>EIN2</italic>, based on gene expression analysis in the <italic>ein2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). It is intriguing that no significant reduction in the transcript levels of the six NAC TF genes was observed in mature leaves of the <italic>ore9</italic> and <italic>ore12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These data further support the possibility that EIN2 is one of the key regulators controlling the expression of NAC TFs during leaf ageing. It is also likely that EIN2 might not be the only route capable of activating the six NAC TF genes because transcript levels of all six NAC TFs were eventually increased as a leaf gets older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">G</xref>). This is further supported by the previous finding that ANAC016, which directly binds to the promoter of <italic>AtNAP</italic> in yeast (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), does not appear to be under the control of EIN2, based on the expression of <italic>ANAC016</italic> in the <italic>ein2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Other TFs, including members of several TF families such as bZIP, bHLH, MYB, and AP2/ERF, were also identified as upstream molecules of ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072 (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hickman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), indicating the complexity of the gene regulatory network involving NAC TFs. Thus, further experiments for identifying EIN2-independent senescence signalling pathways will be needed to better understand the gene regulatory networks involving NAC TFs in the control of leaf senescence. Interestingly, levels of some NAC TF transcripts, including <italic>JUNGBRUNNEN1/ANAC042</italic> reported as a negative regulator of leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), were even higher in the <italic>ein2</italic> mutant. In the case of <italic>ANAC055</italic>, its transcript level was strongly reduced in the <italic>ein2</italic> mutant but significantly increased in the <italic>ore9</italic> and <italic>ore12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This result indicates that gene regulatory networks involving NAC TFs might be complex and interconnected. Elucidation of components acting downstream of EIN2 through genome-wide screening will help to characterize the complex global gene regulatory network activated by EIN2 to control leaf senescence.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>EIN3 directly activates the expression of <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic>
</title><p>In this study, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that EIN3 is an upstream TF controlling the expression of <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic>. First, the expression of <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic> was significantly altered in <italic>ein3 eil1</italic> double mutants, even in young leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

Finally, transiently overexpressed <italic>EIN3</italic> was sufficient to activate the expression of <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">It was notable that EIN3 functions as a transcriptional activator of <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>AtNAP</italic>, which are known to be positive regulators of leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Oh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Guo and Gan, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), whereas EIN3 is known to function as a direct repressor of <italic>miR164</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This suggests that EIN3 can function as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor, depending on the target genes to regulate leaf senescence, in agreement with a previous study (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This result further implies that EIN3 might simultaneously control the expression of <italic>ORE1</italic> and its negative regulator, <italic>miR164</italic>, to regulate leaf senescence efficiently.</p><p content-type="indent">
<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Chang <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> revealed that EIN3 binds to the promoters of the four NAC TF genes (<italic>ANAC019</italic>, <italic>ANAC047</italic>, <italic>ANAC055</italic>, and <italic>ORS1</italic>) after ethylene treatment in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, but the expression of these NAC genes was not altered in the mature leaves of the <italic>ein3 eil1</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This discrepancy implies that EIN3 and EIL1 might regulate different downstream targets under different physiological conditions or at different developmental stages. Thus, it is likely that the four NAC TF genes may not be direct targets of EIN3 and/or EIL1 in a mature leaf to trigger leaf senescence. Alternatively, it is equally possible that the four NAC TFs are targets of EIN3 and/or EIL1, but are regulated primarily by other TF(s) that act downstream of EIN2 in a mature leaf. In other words, the EIN2-mediated senescence signal seems to modulate leaf senescence through at least two independent pathways. These results imply that there are many routes to ensure leaf senescence and the associated cell death upon ageing. Future challenges will include identifying additional TFs that act downstream of the EIN2-mediated senescence signal, and determination of their molecular functions within the context of leaf senescence control.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>The effects of mutations in ORE1 and AtNAP are partially additive in the regulation of leaf senescence</title><p>The functional relationship between ORE1 and AtNAP that act downstream of EIN3 was also investigated by analysing the leaf senescence phenotype of the <italic>ore1 atnap</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The partially additive phenotypes of the <italic>ore1 atnap</italic> double mutant imply that ORE1 and AtNAP have both overlapping and independent functions in the transmission of EIN3-mediated senescence signals. This finding suggests that EIN3-mediated senescence signals can be transmitted via two partially independent pathways, one involving ORE1, and a second involving AtNAP.</p><p content-type="indent">Further understanding of how the gene regulatory network involving ORE1 and AtNAP functions in the regulation of leaf senescence can be facilitated by the identification of downstream target genes. Recent studies utilizing microarray analysis in the <italic>ore1</italic> mutant as well as inducible transgenic lines overexpressing <italic>ORE1</italic> have identified potential targets of ORE1. Among them, <italic>BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE1</italic> has been characterized as a direct downstream target molecule of ORE1 (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Balazadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Matallana-Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). As a direct downstream target gene of AtNAP, <italic>SAG113</italic>, a gene encoding a protein phosphatase 2C family protein phosphatase, has been identified (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Gan, 2012</xref>). However, knowledge about the downstream gene regulatory network of ORE1 and AtNAP remains limited. In this study, downstream NAC TF genes of ORE1 and AtNAP were thus examined by performing transient transactivation assays in order to gain deeper insight into the gene regulatory networks involving ORE1 and AtNAP. It is intriguing that ORE1 and AtNAP did not activate each other, and <italic>ANAC087</italic> and <italic>ANAC102</italic> were preferentially activated by ORE1, not by AtNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>). The results further support the idea that ORE1 and AtNAP act independently in the regulation of leaf senescence by activating different NAC TFs, and they may differentially activate other downstream targets as well. ORE1 and AtNAP activated three common NAC TFs genes (<italic>ANAC041</italic>, <italic>ANAC079</italic>, and <italic>VNI2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>), indicating that ORE1 and AtNAP might compensate for each other&#x02019;s function by activating common downstream components.</p><p content-type="indent">It was notable that some of the NAC TFs activated by ORE1 in the transactivation assays were predicted as potential downstream targets of ORE1 in previous studies. For example, <italic>ANAC102</italic> is also one of the downstream genes predicted to be activated by ORE1 in a recent network modelling analysis based on high-resolution time-course profiles of gene expression during leaf development (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Breeze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). It has also been known that <italic>ANAC041</italic> and <italic>VNI2</italic> might be downstream targets of ORE1 from a microarray analysis during leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Balazadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Rauf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). It is intriguing that ORE1 and AtNAP activate VNI2, a negative regulator of leaf senescence (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These findings imply that ORE1 and AtNAP, in addition to acting as positive regulators of senescence-accelerating genes, may finely tune the progression rate of leaf senescence through activating genes involved in maintenance activity. Further identification of direct downstream targets of ORE1 and AtNAP is essential to provide new insights into how the gene regulatory network involving the EIN2-mediated senescence signal regulates the leaf senescence process. Further experiments combining genetic analysis, ChIP-seq, gene expression profiling, and computational analyses will contribute to the elucidation of complex gene regulatory networks involving EIN2, EIN3, and NAC TFs, and will help us to understand how these pathways are interconnected. Collectively, the present data provide insight into the global gene regulatory network involving EIN3 and NAC TFs, through which the EIN2-mediated senescence signalling pathway coordinates global gene expression during leaf senescence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s20"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <underline>JXB</underline> online.</p><p>
