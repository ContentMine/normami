Parthenocarpy and stenospermocarpy have been described as the main phenomena responsible for seedlessness in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>. However, the key genes underpinning molecular and cellular processes that play a significant role in seed development are not well characterized. To identify important regulators and mechanisms that may be altered in the seedless phenotype, we performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis to compare the transcriptomes of a popular seeded wine cultivar (wild-type) and its seedless somatic variant (mutant) at three key developmental stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The transcriptomes revealed by Illumina mRNA-Seq technology had approximately 98% of grapevine annotated transcripts and about 80% of them were commonly expressed in the two lines. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a total of 1075 differentially expressed genes (DE) in the pairwise comparison of developmental stages, which included DE genes specific to the wild-type background, DE genes specific to the mutant background and DE genes commonly shared in both backgrounds. The analysis of differential expression patterns and functional category enrichment of wild-type and mutant DE genes highlighted significant coordination and enrichment of pollen and ovule developmental pathways. The expression of some selected DE genes was further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study represents the most comprehensive attempt to characterize the genetic bases of seed formation in grapevine. With a high throughput method, we have shown that a seeded wine grape and its seedless somatic variant are similar in several biological processes. Nevertheless, we could identify an inventory of genes with altered expression in the mutant compared to the wild-type, which may be responsible for the seedless phenotype. The genes located within known genomic regions regulating seed content may be used for the development of molecular tools to assist table grape breeding. Therefore the data reported here have provided a rich genomic resource for practical use and functional characterization of the genes that potentially underpin seedlessness in grapevine.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-1030) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Vitis vinifera</italic></kwd><kwd>Seed content</kwd><kwd>mRNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>Differential gene expression</kwd><kwd>Functional category enrichment</kwd><kwd>Candidate gene</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Over the past decade there has been a sustained increase in the world production of table grapes, which reached 22.3 million tons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is largely due to consumer demand for seedless grape for fresh and dry fruit consumption. Nowadays, most breeding programs focus on the generation of new cultivars (cvs) combining seedlessness together with other traits such as large berry size, muscat flavor or crispiness.</p><p><italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. is considered a good model for the study of seed development in fruit crops. Two different mechanisms are involved in grape seedlessness, namely parthenocarpy and stenospermocarpy. Usually, in parthenocarpic conditions fruit develops from the ovary in the absence of fertilization yielding small berries that completely lack seeds (e.g. cv Black Corinth), whereas in stenospermocarpy pollination and fertilization take place normally, but seed development aborts at an early stage (2&#x02013;4 weeks) after fertilization and berry size at harvest is reduced (e.g. cv Sultanina) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most cultivated seedless grapes exhibit stenospermocarpy. The major events that take place in grapevine normal seed development, parthenocarpy and stenospermocarpy are shown schematically in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and are described in detail by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, genetic studies have revealed several genes that participate in seed development like <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (<italic>STM</italic>), <italic>CUP</italic>-<italic>SHAPED COTYLEDON</italic> (<italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic>), <italic>AINTEGUMENTA</italic> (<italic>ANT</italic>)<italic>, SPATULA</italic> (<italic>SPT</italic>)<italic>, AGAMOUS</italic> (<italic>AG</italic>) <italic>MADS box genes AG-SHATTERPROOF</italic> (<italic>SHP1</italic> and <italic>SHP2</italic>), <italic>SEEDSTICK</italic> (<italic>STK</italic>, also known as <italic>AGL11</italic>), <italic>NOZZLE/SPOROCYTELESS</italic> (<italic>NZZ/SPL</italic>), <italic>EMBRYO-DEFECTIVE</italic> (<italic>EMB</italic>) and <italic>INO</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], including those that regulate endosperm formation such as <italic>CRINKLY4</italic> and <italic>BET1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], embryo differentiation such as <italic>EMBRYO-DEFECTIVE</italic> (<italic>EMB</italic>) and <italic>LEAFY COTYLEDON</italic> (<italic>LEC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and seed coat development such as <italic>APETALA 2</italic> (<italic>AP2</italic>) and <italic>TRANSPARENT TESTA 16</italic> (<italic>TT16</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Also, molecular studies with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, tomatoes, and other plants have revealed <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of several genes active during seed development, mostly the transcription factors (TFs) that play a role in their regulation, i.e. <italic>LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC)</italic> genes and <italic>AGAMOUS-like 15</italic> (<italic>AGL15</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, in grapevine the identities of most regulators of seed development and their direct targets are largely unknown. To date, a number of studies have adopted QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) analysis to dissect the genetic determinism of seedlessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A MADS-box ovule identity gene (<italic>VvAGL11</italic>) was proposed as the major positional and functional candidate gene for stenospermocarpy and tested for usefulness in marker-assisted selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, very few studies have looked for genes possibly responsible for seedlessness by comparison of gene expression profiles in seeded and seedless grapes. For instance, differential expression analysis in seeded and seedless clones of cv Sultanina by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] allowed the identification of a chloroplast chaperonin (ch-Cpn21) resulting in seed abortion when silenced in tobacco and tomato, and of a ubiquitin extension protein (S27a) having a probable general role in the control of organ development in grapevine. Recently, differential expression analysis during ovule development in seeded and seedless cultivars identified grape metacaspase genes, consistent with a role of programmed cell death in stenospermocarpy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>To identify regulators and processes required for seed development that may be altered in the seedless phenotype, somatic variants are invaluable resources. At the same time an analytical approach that provides a holistic view of the transcriptional landscape during seed development in both phenotypes is equally vital. In grapevine, somatic variation arises from mutation or epimutation events that first occur in a single cell belonging to a specific cell layer. Once at least one shoot apical meristem is colonized by the mutated cell in one or both cell layers, the mutation can be transmitted by bud propagation or eventually sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, identification of somatic variants in grapevine is a time and labor intensive task, which requires genetic and phenotypic characterization of large germplasm collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. At the same time, the application of deep sequencing techniques to survey the total population of RNA within a tissue has made RNA-Seq a popular and comprehensive approach to deduce and quantify the transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Its potential has been demonstrated in the <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome characterization of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and gene expression profile of grape berry during key developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we exploited the availability of a spontaneous seedless somatic variant (hereafter mutant, MT) derived from Sangiovese (hereafter wild-type, WT), a widespread seeded wine cultivar in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This mutant has a gross morphology of vines identical to the wild-type except for absence of seeds, reduced berry and bunch size at harvest. With the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms driving the seedless phenotype, we analyzed the transcriptional responses possibly related to seed development in the wild-type and the mutant using Illumina mRNA-Seq technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Samples were collected from wild-type and mutant plants in the germplasm collection of Grinzane Cavour maintained by CNR-Istituto di Virologia Vegetale di Grugliasco (Torino, Italy).</p><p>For molecular marker analysis young leaves were gathered.</p><p>To create inventories of gene expression at successive stages of seed formation, three key time points along grape berry development were selected corresponding to stages E-L 15 (single flowers in compact groups), E-L 27 (young berries enlarging) and E-L 38 (berries harvest-ripe) of the modified E-L system described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Next, DE genes were compared between the wild-type and the mutant. This strategy was preferred to the direct comparison of the two clones at each developmental stage in order to minimize the eventual differences due to asynchronous sampling.</p><p>An in-house R script was written to group DE genes with similar expression pattern based on the adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values. By indicating a significant up-regulation with &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;, a significant down-regulation with &#x0201c;-1&#x0201d; and a non-significant difference with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;, the three comparisons between the developmental stages can be summarized with a triplet, e.g. &#x0201c;1, 0, 1&#x0201d;. This example indicates that there is a significant up-regulation going from the first to the second time point, no significant difference between the second and third time points, and a significant positive difference when comparing the first and last time points.

The transcriptional profiles of 14 genes were analyzed.

After pre-processing and quality control, the majority of reads from wild-type (&#x02248;79-81%) and mutant (&#x02248;70-81%) were successfully aligned to v1_mRNA version of the 12x draft annotation of the grapevine genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A large fraction of mapped reads from each developmental stage for wild-type (&#x02248;87-89%) and mutant (&#x02248;85-87%) aligned to a single position.

The other reads mapped to splice junctions (27% and 26%), introns (14% and 16%) and untranslated regions (UTRs) (9% and 7%) for the wild-type and the mutant, respectively. The presence of intronic regions in RNA-Seq experiments is prevalent and has been attributed to various sources such as intron retention during splicing, DNA contamination during RNA-Seq preparation as well as alignment artifacts. Reads mapped to intronic regions in our data set are comparable to those obtained in similar experiments in grapevine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Most of the intronic mapped reads in our data set show strand specificity hence we infer they are mainly due to unspliced mRNA in our samples and others may be due to alignment artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>The digital, count-based nature of RNA-Seq provided a number of potential advantages for downstream data analysis and interpretation. For every gene detected in wild-type and mutant samples, uniquely mapped reads were used to generate raw expression counts and normalized expression values. The normalized expression values were calculated as RPM since it provides a useful way to assess overall expression levels between samples. Following the normalization of read counts, we analyzed the most abundant transcripts within our samples by ranking them based on their <italic>p</italic>-value and ratio of expression. This in turn highlighted the top most highly expressed genes across all possible pairwise comparisons of the libraries (see Methods and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p><p>Overall our data-set identified approximately 98% of grapevine annotated transcripts (representing 27,495 genes) expressed throughout the three developmental stages under study. We detected a gene expression gradient from &#x0201c;before flowering&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;after flowering&#x0201d;, i.e. for wild-type E-L 15 (25,785 expressed genes)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;E-L 27 (25,706 expressed genes)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;E-L 38 (24,822 expressed genes) and for mutant E-L 15 (25,848 expressed genes)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;E-L 27 (25,197 expressed genes)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;E-L 38 (24,089 expressed genes) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). To put these results into perspective, slightly more genes were expressed before fertilization in the mutant than in the wild-type and by far more genes were expressed after fertilization in the wild-type than in the mutant. In the wild-type and the mutant 23,640 and 23,072 genes were expressed in all three developmental stages, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). While it is not surprising the comparable number of genes shared by the three developmental stages in each clone, it is interesting to note that fewer genes were expressed specifically at each developmental stage: 586, 430 and 421 genes at stages E-L 15, E-L 27 and E-L 38 in the wild-type (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) and 802, 337 and 351 genes at respective stages in the mutant (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), which further highlights a reduction in gene expression in the mutant compared to the wild-type after fertilization. Thus we assessed what proportion of the expressed genes were common to both clones in the different stages and found that large number of expressed genes were shared among the wild-type and the mutant throughout development. In particular, 22,516 genes were commonly expressed in both clones in all three developmental stages (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), 24,084 in the first two stages E-L 15 and E-L 27 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>A) and 22,790 in the last two stages E-L 27 and E-L 38 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>B). This was expected based on the phenotypic evaluation of the two clones that revealed similar berry development and ripening (they were at the same developmental stage in the same date). Nevertheless, a fewer number of genes were exclusively expressed in a particular developmental stage and clone (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), suggesting they could be responsible for the specificity of each clone. Finally, a total of 565 genes were not expressed at all (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This set of genes could be genotype-specific and restricted to the grapevine clone PN40024 used for reference mapping.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

In total 1075 genes were differentially expressed (DE) in both clones. With respect to the wild-type a total of 942 genes were found to be differentially expressed during development: 522 between stages E-L 15 and E-L 27, 354 between stages E-L 27 and E-L 38 and 393 between stages E-L 15 and E-L 38 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). For the mutant a total of 634 DE genes were identified: 458 between stages E-L 15 and E-L 27, 191 between stages E-L 27 and E-L 38 and 41 between stages E-L 15 and E-L 38 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Analysis of data set overlap (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>) revealed that about 47% of the total DE genes (501/1075) were expressed in both the wild-type and the mutant (commonly shared expression), which supports the developmental alignment of the two clones. More strikingly, the percentage of DE genes specific to the wild-type with respect to all three developmental stages is 41% (441/1075), while for the mutant it is 12% (133/1075). We further evaluated the percentage of significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes in each pairwise comparison in both the wild-type and the mutant. On average approximately 67% of DE genes in the wild-type and 75% of DE genes in the mutant were down-regulated along development, while 33% and 25% of DE genes were induced in the wild-type and the mutant, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that most of the expressed genes were active in different contexts along the grape berry developmental gradient (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, significant quantitative changes occurred in individual gene expression level that corresponds to a particular stage or switch in development during seed formation. Here the mutant exhibited the strongest reduction in gene expression after fertilization (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that it might be due to shut down in transcriptional processes resulting from incomplete fertilization or failure of embryo development. However, further work will be necessary to test this hypothesis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

For example, we observed a specific significant enrichment of positively regulated (from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27) functional categories in the wild-type group 3, for which the genes were mainly related to cell wall modification. Here stage E-L 27 corresponded to &#x0201c;after fertilization&#x0201d;, a phase of berry development mainly characterized with extensive cell division.

For both clones and all genes, the real-time PCR results were consistent with the expression profiles determined from RNA-Seq data. Seven genes had similar expression profiles in the wild-type and the mutant, while the expression of the remaining 7 genes ranged from slightly different to completely opposite which suggests that some pathways may be altered in the seedless phenotype (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

We selected four genes that play roles in cellular process, transport and signaling.</p><p>Among cellular process genes, VIT_09s0002g01980 encodes the myosin-like protein XIK, which is involved in actin organization and biogenesis as well as actin-driven movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

Among the signaling genes are VIT_04s0044g01520 and VIT_08s0058g01200. VIT_04s0044g01520 encodes GA 20-oxidase 2, which is involved in gibberellic acid biosynthesis, whereas VIT_08s0058g01200 codes for the alpha-expansin 2 protein that participates in auxin-mediated signaling pathway as well as regulating cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Non-DE genes specific to the mutant</title><p>All the genes that fell within this category did not meet the RPM selection criteria described in the Methods and did not have defined function when annotated; meaning that, many of them returned no hit upon functional annotation. Nevertheless, we noticed a few genes whose functional roles could be implicated in seed development. They included the histone deacetylase <italic>HDA14</italic> gene (VIT_13s0106g00290), involved in chromatin organization through protein acetylation and deacetylation, a gene (VIT_03s0088g00900) coding for a pathogenesis-related protein 1B implicated in jasmonate-mediated signaling as well as in plant-pathogen interaction and a transposase <italic>IS4</italic> gene (VIT_14s0006g00050) that encodes a transposable element protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Differential regulation of common transcriptional processes in the wild-type and the mutant</title><p>Significant number of expressed genes were common among wild-type and mutant growth stages, which suggests that the corresponding proteins may function in a common pathway to carry out a wide range of developmental processes. We reasoned that many of these shared genes will respond in both clones to the same signals that control the switch from one developmental phase (before fertilization) to another (after fertilization), and will have similar pattern of expression. Indeed, differential expression analysis revealed 501 DE genes common to the wild-type and the mutant (47% of the total 1075 DE genes) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>).</p><p>Thirty-five of these genes showed different expression between the two clones along the time course. Among the 35 genes, six were significantly enriched and three of them had a functional annotation corresponding to seed development: pectate lyase, histone H1flk-like protein (H1flk), and beta-expansin (EXPB4). Pectate lyase is an enzyme involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis by catabolizing pectin. In tomato, two pectate lyases were found to be maximally expressed at the late stage of pollen development. It was suggested that the pollen expression of these genes might relate to a requirement for pectin degradation during pollen tube growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the present study, the pectate lyase gene VIT_01s0026g01680 was up-regulated from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27 in both clones but the fold change was six times higher in the wild-type compared to the mutant. Based on its functional annotation, the histone H1flk-like gene VIT_05s0020g04850 plays a role in chromatin assembly. Its <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog encodes a P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily protein that functions in ATP binding activity involved in cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In the mutant background, this gene was specifically up-regulated from stage E-L 27 to stage E-L 38 while in the wild-type a significant differential expression with a lower fold change was observed only between stages E-L 15 and E-L 38. The beta-expansin gene VIT_15s0021g02700 was not expressed at stage E-L 15 in the mutant. Differential expression analysis in the mutant showed specific up-regulation from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27, in contrast to a stable expression in the wild-type between the same stages. Based on its functional annotation, this gene encodes a protein involved in auxin-mediated signaling, which implies a late induction of auxin responsive genes in the mutant.</p><p>As expected, 466 out of the 501 common DE genes shared the same group or expression profile in both the wild-type and the mutant. Functional annotation and GO term enrichment uncovered many biological processes, which included cell wall metabolism, cell cycling, primary and secondary metabolism, signaling and regulation of gene expression, water transport and abiotic stress responses. Within this set the following four genes are of interest. VIT_15s0048g00510 encodes a protein that belongs to the pectinesterase family, up-regulated from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27 with double fold change in the wild-type compared to the mutant. Functional annotation revealed the protein involvement in cell wall modification through pectin degradation. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it has been shown that cell type-specific pectin degradation is required to separate microspores during pollen development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. VIT_15s0021g02170, VIT_18s0089g00140 and VIT_19s0015g00960 showed a similar behavior: they were down-regulated from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27 in both clones, but much more expressed in the wild-type than in the mutant. VIT_15s0021g02170 encodes chalcone and stilbene synthase. Its <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog is involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthetic process and pollen exine formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. VIT_18s0089g00140 encodes 1,4-beta-mannan endohydrolase, which is implicated in fructose and mannose metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Description of biological processes associated to its <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog revealed a role in seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog of VIT_19s0015g00960 is required for male fertility and pollen exine formation as it encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter involved in tapetal cell and pollen development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Finally, within this category we identified two genes already proposed to affect seed and/or berry development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. They code for the PISTILLATA (PI) floral homeotic protein (VIT_18s0001g01760) and the MADS-box AP3 transcription factor (VIT_18s0001g13460). The latter co-localizes with the stable QTL for berry weight, seed number and fresh weight identified by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Differentially expressed genes specific to the wild-type background</title><p>The 441 genes specifically modulated among the wild-type developmental stages represented 12 groups and included a range of functional categories. A large number (approximately 64%) of these genes were observed among nine groups, down-regulated from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27 and not differentially expressed from stage E-L 27 to stage E-L 38 or vice versa. The remaining 36% were observed in three groups, and were up-regulated in the same manner (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Down-regulated genes specific to wild-type (from stage E-L15 to stage E-L 27)</title><p>Within this category we observed several interesting genes that showed significant enrichment of GO terms and very high negative fold change. They include five genes, three of which encode similar proteins: <italic>MALE STERILITY 1</italic> (<italic>MS1</italic>, VIT_01s0011g06390), <italic>MALE STERILITY 2</italic> (<italic>MS2</italic>, VIT_08s0007g07100) and <italic>MALE STERILITY 5</italic> (<italic>MS5,</italic> VIT_07s0005g05680, VIT_07s0005g05720 and VIT_15s0107g00550). The gene coding for MS1 protein belongs to the PHD family of transcription factors. The <italic>Arabidopsis MS1</italic> gene was described to be a sporophytic factor controlling anther and pollen development. It plays a critical role in the induction of pollen wall and pollen coat materials in the tapetum and, ultimately, the production of viable pollen. Indeed, mutants show a semi-sterile phenotype, as their pollen degenerates after microspore release. In addition their tapetum appears abnormally vacuolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The <italic>MS2</italic> gene has an unclear function in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, however its <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> best match was described as a fatty acid reductase gene, involved in oxidation-reduction process and pollen exine formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The function of the <italic>MS5</italic> gene in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> is unknown, however in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> it was suggested to be similar to <italic>POLLENNESS3</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Mutants of this gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were shown to have defects in functional microspore production that lead to the degeneration of cells within the anther locules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. One of the three <italic>MS5</italic> gene predictions co-located with a minor QTL for mean seed fresh weight on chromosome 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The significant down-regulation of these genes from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27 in the wild-type implies that they were highly induced at stage E-L 15, where they exhibited maximum expression levels, perhaps to ensure viable and functional pollen development for complete fertilization. On the other hand, in the mutant, these genes were not differentially expressed. Further analysis of their RPM values in the mutant revealed very low level of expression at stage E-L 15, when compared to the wild-type. This observation might suggest abnormal pollen development in the mutant resulting in non-functional or partially sterile pollen. However, it needs to be tested and confirmed experimentally.</p><p>Within this category we found two additional genes with a putative role in ovule and pollen differentiation: <italic>SPOROCYTELESS</italic> (VIT_19s0014g03940) and <italic>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1</italic> (VIT_12s0142g00040). The <italic>SPOROCYTELESS</italic> gene of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was described to encode a transcription factor that is required for the initiation of both micro- and megagametogenesis and is expressed in the sporogenous tissue of the anther and the ovule. It is involved in establishing the prospective chalaza of the ovule, plays a central role in patterning both the proximal-distal and the adaxial-abaxial axes in the ovule and regulates the anther cell differentiation. Mutant is defective in the differentiation of primary sporogenous cells into microsporocytes, and does not properly form the anther wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog of <italic>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1</italic> gene was shown to be expressed in flower buds and siliques. Its protein is involved in metabolic processes such as phosphatidylglycerol biosynthetic process, pollen sperm cell differentiation, and response to karrikin.

The significant up-regulation of the nodulin MtN3 gene from stage E-L 15 to stage E-L 27 in the wild-type compared to the mutant could imply an active role in promoting fertilization. In contrast, down-regulation of this gene from stage E-L 27 to stage E-L 38, which corresponds to a period of seed maturation (after fertilization), seems to support the notion that genes participating or promoting seed formation are tightly regulated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Up-regulated genes specific to the wild-type (from stage E-L 27 to stage E-L 38)</title><p>Within this category we found a gene coding for oleosin OLE-2 protein (VIT_17s0000g09000), with a putative role in oil body organization and biogenesis as well as in reproduction and seed development.

The examination of absolute expression count for every gene has enabled us to carry out a global investigation of gene expression at three key time-points during seed formation covering from before anthesis to after fertilization. This has in turn allowed a comprehensive description of distinguishing transcriptional events in the two lines, based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes, gene patterns and enriched functional categories. We have given a detailed account of the expression profiles of the genes potentially required to initiate and to complete seed development, including genes involved in gametophyte development, cell division, cell wall organization, as well as signaling molecules and transcription factors. Reduction in the number of transcripts observed in the mutant after fertilization seems consistent with shut down in transcriptional processes resulting from incomplete fertilization or failure of embryo development. Here the significant low expression profile of male sterility genes in the mutant and the high induction of the same genes in the wild-type suggests non-functional or partially sterile pollen in the mutant, which is in agreement with preliminary observations from the phenotypic characterization underway and encourages further investigation. We surmise that some of the candidate genes derived from this study could be useful for the development of molecular markers to assist breeding programs, especially if these genes are located in a genomic region of a known QTL for seed content. In conclusion, the data reported here have provided a rich genomic resource for functional characterization of the genes that potentially underpin seedlessness in grapevine.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Supporting data</title><p>The data sets supporting the results of this article are included within the article and its additional files.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec33"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12864_2014_6843_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Additional file 1: Figure S1:
