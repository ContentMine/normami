Here, we report that JMJ14 is physically associated with two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors, NAC050 and NAC052. The <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> plants and the CRISPR-CAS9-mediated <italic>nac050/052</italic> double mutant plants show an early flowering phenotype, which is similar to the phenotype of <italic>jmj14</italic>, suggesting a functional association between JMJ14 and NAC050/052. RNA-seq data indicated that hundreds of common target genes are co-regulated by JMJ14 and NAC50/052. Our ChIP analysis demonstrated that JMJ14 and NAC050 directly bind to co-upregulated genes shared in <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic>, thereby facilitating H3K4 demethylation and transcriptional repression. The NAC050/052 recognition DNA cis-element was identified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay at the promoters of its target genes. Together, our study identifies two novel NAC transcription repressors and demonstrates that they are involved in transcriptional repression and flowering time control by associating with the histone demethylase JMJ14.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>18 February 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Histone methylation affects transcription status on chromatin and is dynamically regulated through the addition and removal of methyl groups. The enzymes that contain an evolutionarily conserved SET domain (named after the three <italic>Drosophila</italic> histone methyltransferases <underline>S</underline>u(var)3&#x02013;9, <underline>E</underline>(z) and <underline>T</underline>rithorax) catalyze histone lysine methylation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases are responsible for the removal of methyl groups from methylated histone at lysine sites and are conserved in plants, animals and fungi (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are 21 JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases that have been named JMJ11&#x02013;JMJ31 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases are involved in diverse biological processes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). JMJ25/IBM1 (Increase in Bonsai Methylation 1), which is necessary for floral development, is responsible for H3K9 demethylation at actively transcribed genes and protects these genes from DNA methylation at CHG sites (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). JMJ30/JMJD5 positively affects circadian clock-regulated gene expression and is involved in controlling the circadian rhythm (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The histone arginine demethylases JMJ20 and JMJ22 act as positive regulators of seed germination by mediating the removal of repressive histone arginine methylation and the transcriptional activation at <italic>GA3ox1</italic> and <italic>GA3ox2</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). ELF6/JMJ11 and REF6/JMJ12 are two close homologs that control flowering time and other developmental processes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). REF6 acts as an H3K27me3 demethylase and contributes to the expression of genes involved in development and stress response (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although these JmjC histone demethylases were identified and characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, further studies are required to clarify how conserved histone demethylases have different target genes and are involved in diverse biological processes.</p><p>The H3K4 demethylase JMJ14 is involved in repression of the floral integrator genes <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Moreover, JMJ14 is required for maintenance of transcriptional silencing through an RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Interestingly, JMJ14 is involved in transcriptional repression of aberrant RNAs, which trigger post-transcriptional gene silencing (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The close homologs of JMJ14, JMJ15 and JMJ18, regulate flowering time through reducing H3K4 trimethylation at the floral repressor gene <italic>FLC</italic>, resulting in the repression of <italic>FLC</italic> expression and the promotion of flowering time (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The role of JMJ15 and JMJ18 in flowering promotion is opposite to that of JMJ14 in flowering repression.</p><p>The mammalian histone demethylases usually interact with transcriptional regulators to control gene expression for specific target genes. The JmjC histone demethylase JHDM2A/JMJD1a interacts with the androgen receptor and cause the removal of H3K9 demethylation, resulting in the transcriptional activation of androgen receptor target genes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). JARID1C/SMCX and the transcription repressor REST interact with each other and occupy the promoters of REST target genes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The depletion of JARID1C increases H3K4 trimethylation and simultaneously induces the expression of REST target genes that are implicated in X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy. JARID1a forms a complex with the CLOCK-BMAL1 transcription factors, influencing the circadian clock by activating the transcription of Per2 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The plant-specific NAC (<underline>N</underline>AM, <underline>A</underline>TAF1 and <underline>C</underline>UC1/CUC2) proteins form one of the largest transcription factor families in plants (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). NAC transcription factors are involved in various biological processes, including development, hormone signaling, senescence and biotic and abiotic stress responses (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). NAC transcription factors contain a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding NAC domain and a diversified C-terminal transcription regulatory domain. Previous studies have demonstrated that many NAC proteins are transcriptional activators, whereas a few others are transcription repressors (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). NAC proteins are recruited to their target loci by directly binding the DNA-cis element in the promoter of their target genes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>JMJ14 is involved in transcriptional gene silencing and flowering time regulation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but we do not know how JMJ14 specifically functions at a subset of genes but not others. Given that several histone demethylases exist in protein complexes in animals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we asked whether JMJ14 associates with any other proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Thus, we generated <italic>JMJ14&#x02013;3xFlag</italic> transgenic plants to affinity purify JMJ14-associated proteins and identify these proteins by mass spectrometry. Our study demonstrates that JMJ14 and two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors, NAC050 and NAC052, associate with each other and co-occupy hundreds of common target genes, resulting in H3K4 demethylation and transcriptional repression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Plant materials, constructs and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> materials included the wild-type (WT) Col-0, <italic>jmj14</italic> (Salk_135712C) and <italic>NAC050/52-RNAi</italic> plants.

Based on previous transcriptome data (Supplementary Table S2), <italic>NAC050/052</italic> and <italic>JMJ14</italic> are highly expressed in floral organs and moderately expressed in other organs. Thus, flowers were collected from 1-month-old plants and used for affinity purification of JMJ14&#x02013;3xFlag by anti-Flag antibody-conjugated agarose. Purified proteins were subjected to a mass spectrometric assay. Two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors, NAC050 (AT3G10480) and NAC052 (AT3G10490), were identified in co-purified proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The two <italic>NAC</italic> genes form tandem repeats on the genome and may originate from a recent duplication.

The results indicate that JMJ14 can interact with both NAC050 and NAC052 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To clarify whether the possible DNA binding ability of JMJ14 or NAC050/052 is required for the interaction between JMJ14 and NAC050/052, we performed co-IP after the protein extracts were treated with DNase (Supplementary Figure S2) and found that the addition of DNase has no effect on the interaction between JMJ14 and NAC050/052, indicating that the interaction is independent of the binding of JMJ14 and NAC050/052 to chromatin. By gel filtration, we found that NAC050 and NAC052 were co-eluted at the fractions between 13 and 21 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), suggesting that the two NAC proteins may form a tight complex <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We also determined whether JMJ15 and JMJ18, two close homologs of JMJ14 (Supplementary Figure S4), interact with NAC050 and NAC052 by yeast two-hybrid.

Thus, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to test whether the two NAC transcription factors interact with each other. The results indicate that NAC050 interacts not only with NAC050 but also with NAC052, whereas NAC052 cannot interact with NAC052 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

The FYRC domain of JMJ14 by itself (JMJ14-f) is sufficient for the interaction of JMJ14 with NAC052 but not with NAC050 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>). For the interaction of JMJ14 with NAC050, not only the FYRC domain but also the two other domains JmjC and C5HC2 are required (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>).

Therefore, the FYRC domain is necessary for the interaction of JMJ14 with both NAC050 and NAC052 as determined by the yeast two-hybrid assay.

A large number of genes are co-upregulated or co-downregulated in the <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> plants.

In <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic>, the expected numbers for overlapping upregulated and downregulated genes by chance are 40 and 18, respectively. The numbers are significantly less than those of observed overlapping genes, suggesting a functional association between JMJ14 and NAC050/052. To confirm the effect of <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> on co-upregulated genes as determined by RNA-seq, we selected 10 of them for validation by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).

Moreover, we determined whether co-upregulated genes identified in 2-week-old seedlings as determined by RNA-seq are also upregulated in tissues of adult plants. We found that three co-upregulated genes identified in 2-week-old seedlings are markedly upregulated by <italic>jmj14</italic> in all the tested tissues from 1-month-old plants, and the effect of <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> on the expression of these genes is variable in different tissues (Supplementary Figure S11). In general, <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> either does not affect their expression in all the tested tissues or affects in some specific tissues to various extents, suggesting that the involvement of JMJ14 in repression of these genes may occur in both NAC050/052-dependent and NAC050/052-independent manners. The expression of JMJ14 target genes are prone to be ubiquitously regulated by JMJ14, whereas the function of NAC050/052 is likely dependent on specific target loci, developmental stages and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>JMJ14 and NAC050/052 are required for the H3K4 demethylation of their common target genes</title><p>JMJ14 is a histone H3K4 demethylase that is required for removing H3K4 trimethylation, a histone modification that is related to transcriptional activation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

The results show that H3K4me3 is preferentially present in euchromatic regions of each chromosome (Supplementary Figure S12A&#x02013;E).

However, we identified in total 555 genes that showed a significantly increased H3K4me3 in <italic>jmj14</italic>, whereas only 62 genes show decreased H3K4me3 (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7), which is consistent with the role of JMJ14 in H3K4 demethylation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). At least some of the identified 555 genes may be direct targets of JMJ14, whereas the decrease of H3K4me3 in the 62 genes is likely due to an indirect effect of <italic>jmj14</italic> on gene repression.

The enrichment of NAC050 at these loci was not decreased in the <italic>jmj14</italic> mutant (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), implying that JMJ14 is not required for the occupancy of NAC050 on its target loci. These results suggest that JMJ14 and NAC050 are recruited to their common target genes independently. The aforementioned results indicated that the FYRC domain of JMJ14 is responsible for the interaction of JMJ14 with NAC050 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;D</xref>). We determined whether the FYRC domain is required for the function of JMJ14 in transcriptional repression by a complementation assay. <italic>AT3G18610</italic> and <italic>AT3G59250</italic> are two common target genes shared by NAC050/052 and JMJ14. In the <italic>jmj14</italic> mutant and the <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> lines, the expression of the two genes is significantly upregulated (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>). By the complementation assay, we demonstrated that the expression of the two genes in the <italic>jmj14</italic> mutant was restored by the full-length transgene <italic>JMJ14-Flag</italic> but not by the truncated transgene <italic>JMJ14-a-Flag</italic> in which the FYRC domain is absent (Supplementary Figure S16). Although the recruitment of JMJ14 to its target genes is independent of NAC050, the interaction of NAC050 with JMJ14 may contribute to the function of JMJ14 on its target loci. However, we cannot absolutely exclude the possibility that the FYRC domain has another function, which is probably responsible for the loss-of-function phenotype. The <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> lines exhibit elevated H3K4me3 levels at the common target genes shared by NAC050/NAC052 and JMJ14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">E</xref>; Supplementary Figures S13 and S14). It is difficult to rule out the possibility that the elevation of H3K4me3 is caused by increased transcript levels, but the physical and functional association between NAC050/052 and JMJ14 strongly suggests that NAC050/052 directly regulate the function of the histone demethylase JMJ14 at their common target genes.</p><p>JMJ14 acts as a H3K4 demethylase and is involved in transcriptional repression (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). NAC050 directly binds the common target genes of NAC050 and JMJ14 and represses the expression of these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>; Supplementary Table S5), suggesting that NAC050 can act as a transcriptional repressor of these genes. <italic>AT2G18720, AT2G21640</italic> and <italic>AT5G16020</italic> are the common target genes shared by JMJ14 and NAC050/052 (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>). The promoter sequences of these genes were used to drive the luciferase reporter gene in a transient expression assay in protoplast cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). While their promoter sequences drive the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, the transformation of the construct harboring the <italic>35S-NAC050</italic> overexpression construct significantly reduces the expression of the reporter gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The expression of <italic>AT1G02580</italic> was not affected by <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> (Supplementary Table S5), and its promoter had no predicted NAC050-binding site and failed to be bound by NAC050 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Thus, we used the promoter of <italic>AT1G02580</italic> as a negative control in the luciferase reporter assay. As expected, we found that the luciferase reporter driven by the promoter of <italic>AT1G02580</italic> was not affected by overexpression of <italic>NAC050</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). These results suggest that NAC050 acts as a transcriptional repressor on its target genes.</p><p>We further performed a reporter gene assay using the luciferase reporter gene driven by a minimum <italic>35S</italic> promoter with a GAL4 binding site <italic>5xUAS</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). In the effector construct, the full-length or truncated NAC050 coding sequences were ligated in frame with the coding sequence of the GAL4 DBD-VP16 fusion protein, in which the GAL4 DNA binding domain was fused with the VP16 transcriptional activation domain. As previously reported, GAL4 DBD-VP16 by itself activates the expression of the luciferase reporter gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). When either the full-length NAC050 or the N-terminal half of NAC050 was fused with GAL4 DBD-VP16 in the effector construct, the reporter gene expression was markedly decreased (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). However, when the C-terminal half of NAC050 was fused with GAL4 DBD-VP16, the reporter gene expression was only weakly affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Thus, NAC050 is a transcription repressor and the transcriptional repression domain is included in the N-terminal region of NAC050. A previous study identified a conserved transcriptional repression domain (NARD) at the N-terminal region of NAC transcription factors (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We found that the NARD domain is conserved at the N-terminal region of NAC050, which is consistent with the requirement of the N-terminal region of NAC050 for transcriptional repression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Identification of NAC050-binding DNA elements</title><p>We have demonstrated that NAC050 is recruited to its target genes independently of JMJ14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). It is interesting to identify the DNA cis-element that is bound by NAC050/052. As described above, <italic>UGT74E2</italic> (AT1G05680) is a common target gene that is shared by NAC050/052 and JMJ14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5).

In NAC050, the N-terminal NAC domain but not the C-terminal regulatory domain is responsible for the DNA-binding ability (Supplementary Figure S17C). Therefore, we used the NAC domain protein in EMSA to determine the NAC050-binding DNA element in the <italic>UGT74E2</italic> promoter sequence. The NAC domain of NAC050 not only binds to the &#x0223c;300-bp <italic>UGT74E2</italic> promoter sequence (P1), but also binds to the truncated sequence (P2) from &#x02212;194 to +13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S17A). Seven individual oligonucleotides (P3&#x02013;P9) covering the full-length P2 sequence were used in the EMSA to identify the fragments that are required for NAC050 binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S17). The results indicate that only the oligonucleotides P8 and P9 can be bound by NAC050 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Identification and characterization of the NAC050/052-binding DNA cis-element. (A) NAC050 binds to the promoter sequence of its target gene <italic>UGT74E2</italic> as determined by EMSA. A series of DNA fragments in the AT1G05680 promoter were used in the binding assay. (B) The oligonucleotide sequence AT1G05680-P9 harboring the NAC050 binding site was mutated at a series of three nucleotides and then used in the NAC050 binding assay. The binding levels were normalized by the binding between NAC050 and the WT oligonucleotide sequence. Shown are the results from three independent replicates. (C) The AT1G05680-P9 oligonucleotide was subjected to mutation at one residue and was then used in the NAC050 binding assay by EMSA. Each nucleotide was mutated to three other nucleotides to determine the alternation of the nucleotide. (D) The luciferase reporter gene was driven by the <italic>35S</italic> minimal promoter ligated with GAL4 binding element in front of a 5xNAC050-binding element (CTTGGTCGC<underline>C<bold>A</bold>CG</underline>GAA). The 5xNAC050-binding element was substituted with CTTGGTCGC<underline>C<bold>C</bold>CG</underline>GAA and used as a negative control. The expression of the reporter gene was determined by the luciferase activity assay in protoplast cells. The effector construct GAL4-DBD-VP16 was used to activate the reporter gene. The <italic>NAC050</italic> expression construct was transformed to determine the effect of NAC050 on the expression of the reporter gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gku1382fig7"/></fig><p>To determine the NAC050-binding DNA element in the P9 sequence of the <italic>UGT74E2</italic> promoter, we generated a series of mutant P9 oligonucleotides harboring mutations in three residues and performed EMSA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The binding of NAC050 to the mutant P9 sequences was normalized by the binding of NAC050 to the WT P9 sequence. The results indicate that the binding of NAC050 to the mutant P9 oligonucleotide P9-M7 was significantly reduced compared to the binding of NAC050 to the WT P9 oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), suggesting that the mutation site in P9-M7 is required for the binding of NAC050. We thereafter generated a series of mutant P9 oligonucleotides harboring mononucleotide mutations covering the mutant site of P9-M7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). The EMSA demonstrated that the CACG motif in P9 is sufficient for the binding of NAC050 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). In the CACG motif, the first and third cytosines can be substituted by thymine and adenine, respectively, without affecting the binding of NAC050, while other substitutions reduce the binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Thus, the optimal NAC050-binding motif is (C/T)A(C/A)G. This motif is absent in the five other tested oligonucleotides P3, P4, P5, P6 and P7, which is consistent with the defect in the binding of NAC050 to these oligonucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S17A). However, although the canonical NAC050-binding motif is absent in P8, NAC050 can still bind to P8 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S17A). The sequence of P8 is <underline>CAAT</underline>TTTTGGATTG<underline>TAGT</underline>C<underline>CAATTAAT</underline>GAG and its reverse-complement sequence is CTCAT<underline>TAAT</underline>TGGACTA<underline>CAAT</underline>CCAA<underline>AAAT</underline>TG (Supplementary Figure S17A). The underlined DNA sequences are weak NAC050-binding motifs as determined by our EMSA experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). There are totally seven weak NAC050-binding motifs in P8, suggesting that the presence of a high number of weak NAC050-binding motifs is probably sufficient for binding.</p><p>To confirm that the identified NAC050-binding element is functional, we integrated five repeats of the NAC050-binding element into the promoter of the luciferase reporter gene, which contains a <italic>35S</italic> minimal promoter and a GAL4 binding site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). The luciferase reporter gene was transiently expressed in protoplast cells, whereas NAC050 overexpression inhibited &#x0223c;50% of the luciferase reporter gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). However, when the NAC050-binding element repeats were mutated, NAC050 overexpression failed to inhibit the expression of the reporter gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). The results demonstrate that NAC050 directly binds to the NAC050-binding element repeats and acts as a transcriptional repressor.</p><p>We performed an informatic analysis to search for overpresented DNA elements at the promoters of the 494 common target genes shared by JMJ14 and NAC050 (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), and found that the DNA element containing CACG is the most enriched DNA element at the promoters of these genes (Supplementary Figure S18). These results suggest that the NAC050-binding DNA element identified in this study is predictive and is a functional NAC050-binding DNA element <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The physical and functional links between JmjC histone demethylases and transcription factors have been well studied in mammals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It is important to determine whether and how JmjC histone demethylases associate with transcription factors in plants. NAC transcription factors form one of the largest transcription factor families in plants and are involved in diverse biological processes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We demonstrate that JMJ14 is involved in flowering time regulation by associating with two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription repressors NAC050 and NAC052. The NAC family proteins contain a conserved NAC domain that is responsible for DNA binding (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Although the NAC domains are conserved in different subgroups of the NAC family proteins, their DNA recognition sequences are diverse (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). We identified a NAC050-binding DNA element in the promoter of the NAC050/052 target gene (AT1G05680), demonstrating that (C/T)A(C/A)G is the optimal NAC050 recognition motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), which is similar to the previously identified CACG motif that is bound by NAC019, NAC055 and NAC072 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We propose that in addition to the NAC050/052-binding element, other characteristics of chromatin are probably required for NAC050/052 recognition of chromatin.</p><p>JMJ14 is a histone H3K4 demethylase that is involved in the demethylation of H3K4 concomitantly with repression of gene transcription (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We demonstrate that JMJ14 is physically associated <italic>in vivo</italic> with the two NAC proteins NAC050 and NAC052 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which is consistent with the finding of the interaction between JMJ14 and NAC050 in a proteome-wide yeast two-hybrid assay for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). More importantly, we confirm the functional association between JMJ14 and NAC050/052 in flowering time control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;G</xref>). RNA-seq identified a number of genes that are increased in either <italic>jmj14</italic> or <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic>, with more than half of the increased genes in <italic>jmj14</italic> overlapping with those in <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). These results demonstrate a functional link between JMJ14 and NAC050/052. Previous studies demonstrated that the early flowering phenotype of <italic>jmj14</italic> is correlated with increased expression of floral integrator genes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which are consistent with our study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). We found that the expression of the floral integrator genes <italic>FT, LFY</italic> and <italic>PI</italic> is also increased in the two individual <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that the expression of a large number of genes is increased by both <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> in our RNA-seq results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Moreover, the expression of the floral integrator genes <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>PI</italic> is decreased in the <italic>NAC050</italic> overexpression plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), confirming that NAC050 is involved in the repression of floral integrator genes. The early flowering phenotype that is shared by <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> is related to the depression of their common target floral integrator genes.</p><p>Histone H3K4 methylation is predominantly enriched at the transcription start sites of two-thirds of the protein-coding genes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). H3K4 methylation is usually correlated with actively transcribed genes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The SET domain-containing histone H3K4 methyltransferases ATX1, EFS/SDG8 and ATXR7/SDG25 are responsible for H3K4 methylation at the flowering repressor gene <italic>FLC</italic>. The <italic>atx1, efs/sdg8</italic> and <italic>atxr7</italic>/<italic>sdg25</italic> mutants present an early flowering phenotype that is accompanied by decreased H3K4 trimethylation at <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). FLD, a homolog of the human histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1, is involved in the H3K4 demethylation of <italic>FLC</italic> and is therefore responsible for the repression of <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The histone H3K4 methylation activity of EFS/SDG8 is antagonized by the H3K4 demethylation activity of FLD at <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The JmjC-type histone demethylases JMJ15 and JMJ18 are also involved in H3K4 demethylation at <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, histone H3K4 methylation and demethylation at <italic>FLC</italic> play important roles in flowering time regulation.</p><p>Although JMJ14 is a histone H3K4 demethylase that shows a high degree of similarity to JMJ15 and JMJ18 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), JMJ14 can specifically repress floral integrator genes, but not the floral repressor gene <italic>FLC</italic>, that are targeted by JMJ15 and JMJ18. Thus, JMJ14 acts as a floral repressor (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which is in contrast to the floral integrator role of JMJ15 and JMJ18 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). It is necessary to understand how histone demethylases act on their specific target genes.</p><p>We demonstrate that JMJ14 specifically cooperates with NAC050/052 and is involved in the repression of a number of common target genes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Unlike JMJ14, JMJ15 and JMJ18 fail to interact with NAC050/052 (Supplementary Figure S5). The C-terminal FYRC domain of JMJ14 is necessary for the interaction between JMJ14 and NAC050/052 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;D</xref>). We found that although the N-terminal region of JMJ14 is highly similar with that of JMJ15 and JMJ18, the C-terminal FYRC domain of JMJ14 is much different from that of JMJ15 and JMJ18 (Supplementary Figure S4). The absence of the FYRC domain in JMJ15 and JMJ18 is consistent with the finding that JMJ15 and JMJ18 fail to interact with NAC050/052 as determined by yeast two-hybrid. JMJ14 and NAC050/052 directly bind their common target genes and act as transcription repressors of these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;D</xref>; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Thus, the functional specificity of JMJ14 in flowering time control is consistent with the interaction specificity of JMJ14 with NAC050/052 on their common target genes. Further studies are required to understand whether the interaction of JMJ14 with NAC050/052 is necessary for the function of JMJ14 in gene regulation and flowering time control.</p><p>Our results suggest that the full length of NAC050 is required for the interaction of NAC050 with JMJ14 (Supplementary Figure S6). The N-terminal NAC domain of NAC transcription factors is conserved and is required for NAC dimerization as well as for DNA binding (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). NAC050 and NAC052 not only form dimers but also associate with JMJ14 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The NAC transcription factors have been demonstrated to bind DNA in the form of dimers (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). JMJ14 may interact with NAC050/052 dimers or higher molecular weight oligomers but not with NAC050/052 monomers at their common target genes. Thus, the NAC domain-mediated oligomerization of NAC050/052 is most likely necessary for the interaction between NAC050/052 with JMJ14. The C-terminal transcription regulatory domain is diversified in the NAC transcription factors and is necessary for functional specificities of distinct NAC subgroups (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is possible that the C-terminal transcription regulatory domain is required for the formation of an integral NAC050/052 oligomer structure, thereby facilitating the interaction between NAC050/052 and JMJ14.</p><p>It is interesting to understand how JMJ14 and NAC050/052 collaborate in the JMJ14-NAC050/052 complex to transcriptionally repress their common target genes. The H3K4me3 level for co-upregulated genes in <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> is not only increased in <italic>jmj14</italic> but also in <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic>, suggesting that NAC050/052 are involved in JMJ14-mediated H3K4 demethylation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">E</xref>; Supplementary Figure S14). However, the effect of <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> on H3K4me3 is much less than that of <italic>jmj14</italic> for co-upregulated genes shared in <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> even though the effect of <italic>jmj14</italic> and <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> on gene expression is comparable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). The results suggest that NAC050/052 are involved in transcriptional repression by both H3K4 demethylation-dependent and demethylation-independent pathways. Moreover, we identified a large number of genes that are exclusively upregulated in <italic>NAC050/052-RNAi</italic> but not in <italic>jmj14</italic>, suggesting that NAC050/052 act as a transcription repressor even without JMJ14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). For common target genes shared by NAC050/052 and JMJ14, we propose that NAC050/052 not only acts as a transcription repressor to directly repress Pol II-dependent transcription but also associates with JMJ14 and is probably responsible for enhancing the H3K4 demethylation activity of JMJ14 (Supplementary Figure S19). The integrity of the JMJ14-NAC050/052 complex is necessary for transcriptional repression of these genes. Moreover, JMJ14 represses the expression of <italic>NAC050/052</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; Supplementary Table S4), facilitating a feedback loop between NAC050/052 and JMJ14 in transcriptional repression control (Supplementary Figure S19).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gku1382/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
