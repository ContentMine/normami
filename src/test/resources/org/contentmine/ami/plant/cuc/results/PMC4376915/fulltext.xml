In the present study, we identified 101 putative NAC domain-encoding genes (<italic>BdNACs</italic>) through systematic sequence analysis in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, a new model plant of family Poaceae. BdNAC proteins were phylogenetically clustered into 13 groups, and each group possesses similar motif compositions. Phylogenetic analysis using known stress-related NACs from Arabidopsis and rice as query sequences identified 18 <italic>BdNACs</italic> as putative stress-responsive genes. <italic>In silico</italic> promoter analysis showed that almost all <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes contain putative stress-related cis-elements in their promoter regions.

To cope with these stresses, plants have evolved a range of physiological and biochemical responses [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and a complex of signaling transduction pathways [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Transcription factors (TFs) are one of the critical regulatory proteins involved in abiotic stress responses and play important roles downstream of stress signaling cascades. TFs regulate the expression of a subset of stress-related genes and modulate the plant resistance to environmental stresses. Members of DREB, MYB, MYC, bZIP, zinc-finger and NAC families have been well characterized with roles in the regulation of plant stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>NAC TFs comprise a plant-specific gene family, which is characterized by highly conserved NAC domains. NAC was derived from the names of the three firstly described proteins containing the similar conserved DNA-binding domain, namely <underline>N</underline>AM (no apical meristem), <underline>A</underline>TAF1/2 and <underline>C</underline>UC2 (cup-shaped cotyledon) [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Numerous members of this family were identified in the sequenced plant species, including 105 genes in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], 140 genes in rice [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], 152 genes in soybean [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and 163 genes in poplar [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The conserved NAC domain is approximately 160 amino acids in length and contains five conserved regions (A to E) [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The crystal structure of the DNA-binding NAC domain of Arabidopsis ANAC019 and rice SNAC1 shows that NAC domain contains a unique TF fold consisting of a twisted beta-sheet [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At least five different DNA-binding sites for the NAC TFs have been identified in Arabidopsis, including the drought-responsive NAC recognition sequence (NACRS) containing CATGT [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The C-terminal parts of NAC proteins are highly diverse, and function as transcriptional activator or repressor [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A common feature of NAC protein C-terminal regions is the frequent occurrence of simple amino acid repeats and regions rich in serine and threonine, proline and glutamine, or acidic residues [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, both the NAC domain and C-terminal region possess the capacity for mediating protein-protein interactions [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Although over 100 members of NAC family have been identified in many plant species [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], only a few of them have been functionally characterized to date. The originally reported NAC proteins are involved in various aspects of plant development. Arabidopsis CUC2 protein plays important role in controlling the formation of boundary cell [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. <italic>AtNAC1</italic> is induced by auxin and mediates auxin signaling to promote lateral root development [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. More recently, NAC proteins were found to participate in regulating senescence [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and formation of secondary walls [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. NAC proteins were also reported to participate in abiotic and biotic stress responses. Three Arabidopsis NAC proteins ANAC019, ANAC055 and ANAC072 were identified by yeast one-hybrid using promoter region of <italic>ERD1</italic>, and overexpression of either of these genes significantly improved drought resistance in transgenic plants [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently, Arabidopsis NAC proteins JUB1, NTL4 and VNI2 were documented to participate in stress responses by leaf senescence regulation [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Increasing evidence indicated that some NAC TFs play crucial roles in protecting plants against abiotic stresses in rice, such as SNAC1 [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], SNAC2 [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], OsNAC5 [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and OsNAC10 [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <italic>SNAC1</italic> was specifically induced in the guard cells under drought stress condition. Overexpression of <italic>SNAC1</italic> in rice resulted in stomata closure and improved drought resistance in the drought-stressed field condition while the yield of transgenic plants was not affected under normal growth condition [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>OsNAC10</italic> or <italic>OsNAC5</italic> driven by a root-specific promoter <italic>RCc3</italic> in rice also increased grain yield under field drought condition [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> is the first member to be sequenced within the Pooideae subfamily [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], that includes most cool season cereal (such as wheat and barley), forage and turf grasses. Due to its small genome size and plant size, short life cycle, and efficient cultivation and transformation systems, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> has become a model system for functional genomics studies in temperate cereals [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Valdivia et al. [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported eight <italic>SWN</italic> (<italic>SECONDARY WALL NAC</italic>) genes in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>, and revealed the function of <italic>BdSWN5</italic> in secondary cell-wall synthesis and programmed cell death. However, genome-wide systematic analysis of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> NAC TFs continues to be lacking. In the present study, 101 <italic>NAC</italic> genes were identified from the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> Bd21 genome and a detailed evolution, gene structure and conservation domain/motif analyses were performed. Evolutionary relationship of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> NAC protein with their counterparts from monocot rice and eudicot Arabidopsis was comprehensively analyzed, and several putative stress-responsive <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were identified. Furthermore, the expression profiles of <italic>BdNACs</italic> in response to several abiotic stresses and phytohormones were examined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), which provided direct clues for selection of appropriate stress-responsive candidate genes for further functional analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification and annotation of the BdNAC proteins in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>
</title><p>Three different approaches were applied to identify putative NAC domain containing proteins in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>. Initially, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> annotation database (MIPS/JGI v1.2) at Phytozome v9.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/">http://www.phytozome.net</ext-link>) was searched using the keywords &#x02018;NAC&#x02019;. Then, sequences of Arabidopsis and rice NAC proteins were downloaded from TAIR release 10 (The Arabidopsis Information Resource, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.Arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>) and RGAP release 7 (Rice Genome Annotation Project <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/</ext-link>), respectively. BLASTP searches were subsequently performed to identify homologous proteins of Arabidopsis and rice NACs in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>. Finally, HMM profiles of the NAM domains (PF02365) in the Pfam database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org/">http://pfam.xfam.org/</ext-link>) were searched against the Phytozome database of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>. Similar searches were also performed at NCBI database against the non-redundant protein sequence of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> to eliminate possible exclusions of any additional NAC members. All non-redundant sequences were manually checked for the NAM domain and compared with the NAC family in the transcription factor database PlantTFDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/">http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/</ext-link>) and GrassTFDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grassius.org/grasstfdb.html">http://grassius.org/grasstfdb.html</ext-link>). Other conserved domains in addition to NAM domain were also identified in the Pfam database. Transmembrane motifs in the sequences were identified with TMHMM Server v.2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>) using default parameters.</p><p>NAC proteins in other land plants were identified by BLASTP search in Phytozome and plantTFDB using well-known NAC proteins from Arabidopsis, and NCBI database was used for searching the NAC proteins in red and green algae. All putative non-redundant sequences were assessed with Pfam and PROSITE profiling in InterPro database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Chromosomal location, gene structure and duplication analysis for BdNACs</title><p>
<italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were mapped to the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> genome according to their position information from Phytozome. Gene structure display server program (GSDS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.php">http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.php</ext-link>) was utilized to show exon/intron structure of each <italic>BdNAC</italic> gene by comparison of the coding sequences with their corresponding genomic sequences from Phytozome. The duplication pattern for each NAC gene was analyzed using MCScanX software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/">http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/</ext-link>) according to the previous description [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, whole-genome BLASTP analysis of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> was performed using local blast+ software with e-value under 1e-5, and an-outfmt 6 format output was produced. The blast outputs and position of all protein-coding genes were imported into MCScanX software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/">http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/</ext-link>), and genes were classified into various types of duplications including segmental, tandem, proximal and dispersed under a default criterion.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis and motif identification</title><p>Multiple alignments of the full-length protein sequences were performed with ClustalX (version 1.83). The unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA5 software using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and the bootstrap test was carried out with 1000 iterations. Pairwise deletion mode was used to ensure that the highly divergent C-terminal domains could contribute to the topology of the NJ tree. To study the phylogenetic relationship of BdNAC proteins along with their counterparts in Arabidopsis and rice, further multiple sequence alignment including BdNACs and NACs from Arabidopsis (ANACs) and rice (ONACs) was performed using ClustalX (version 1.83). However, when the multiple sequence alignment was used for constructing phylogenetic tree, the error "some pairwise distances could not be estimated" was reported by MEGA5 software due to great variation of several NAC pairwises. Therefore, eight NACs from rice (ONAC003, ONAC081, ONAC113, ONAC114, ONAC115, ONAC116, ONAC117, ONAC130) and one Arabidopsis NAC (ANAC088) with great variations were removed, then the unrooted tree was plotted as described above. The conserved motifs were identified using Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) program version 4.9.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi">http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi</ext-link>) with the following parameters: number of repetitions&#x02014;any, maximum number of motifs&#x02014;20, and the optimum motif widths were constrained to between 6 and 200 residues.

Multiple sequence alignment of BdNACs along with three representative Arabidopsis NAC proteins, such as NAM, ATAF1 and TIP showed that all the BdNAC proteins contained highly conserved N-terminal NAC domain (<xref rid="pone.0122027.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.). Most BdNACs have complete NAC domain that consists of five subdomains (A-E). However, BdNAC058 lacks conserved A and B subdomains, and three BdNACs (BdNAC012, BdNAC070 and BdNAC071) do not contain conserved C, D and E subdomains. These NAC proteins may be characterized as NAC-like proteins according to the description of these proteins in rice [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to the NAC domain, other conserved protein domains and trans-membrane (TM) helices in BdNACs were also identified by Pfam and TMHHM, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0122027.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122027.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). Based on the domain architecture, BdNACs are divided into five groups. Most of the BdNACs are typically NAC proteins that have N-terminal conserved NAC domain and a C-terminal variable region and were classified into structure group I. Three proteins (BdNAC012, BdNAC070 and BdNAC071) containing only the NAC domains were classified into structure group II. Structure group III BdNACs (BdNAC040 and BdNAC097) have two tandem repeated NAC domains. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the NAC domain at the C-terminal end of BdNAC097 had great variations in subdomain A (<xref rid="pone.0122027.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). Structure group IV with seven proteins (BdNAC018, BdNAC030, BdNAC049, BdNAC053, BdNAC065, BdNAC076, BdNAC079) were predicted to comprise a single TM region. Among these predicted trans-membrane BdNACs, only the TM region of BdNAC076 was located at N-terminal. Two BdNACs in structure group V contain other conserved protein domains in addition to the NAC domain. A BED zinc finger domain was identified in BdNAC068. A plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor domain presents in BdNAC076 indicating a putative involvement of this protein in regulation of cell wall extension. To investigate the evolutionary relationship among 101 BdNACs, an unrooted tree was constructed from alignments of full-length NAC protein sequences using MEGA 5.0 by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0122027.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, 101 BdNACs were divided into 13 distinct groups (designated group BdNAC-I to BdNAC-XIII). BdNAC077 was distinguished from other members and formed an individual clade. Group IV consists of the maximum number (22) of BdNACs, while group VI, VII and X each contains a minimum of two BdNACs. All tandem duplicated NAC genes were assigned to same groups with high bootstrap values, as reported in other plant species [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0122027.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0122027.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and motif compositions of <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes.</title><p>(A).

In contrast, largest number of exon/intron structural variants was observed in the group IX and XIII. To further reveal the diversification of BdNACs, putative motifs were predicted by the program MEME. A total of 20 putative motifs were predicted in BdNACs, and the details of sequence logo of each motif were shown in <xref rid="pone.0122027.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>.

Most of the conserved motifs were located in the N-terminal NAC domain, indicating most BdNACs contain conserved N-terminal NAC domain and diversified C-terminal region. In general, conserved N-terminal NAC domains of most BdNACs harbor five conserved motifs, which representing the five subdomains (A-E) of typical NAC domain. Noticeably, some specific motifs were presented in NACs from a specific group or member. For instance, motif 17 presents in six members of subgroup XI, and motif 19 only presents in BdNAC053 as 5 tandem repeats. Whether these motifs confer unique functional roles to BdNACs remained to be further investigated.

Nine NACs from rice and Arabidopsis were removed due to great variation of their full-length protein sequences (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">method</xref>). Thus a total of 332 NACs, comprising 99 from Arabidopsis, 132 from rice, and 101 from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>, were used for construction of an unrooted phylogenetic tree. As illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0122027.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>., the phylogenetic analysis classified the BdNACs into several groups together with their Arabidopsis and rice orthologs. The groups were designated as alphabetical families (NAC-a to NAC-p) based on tree topologies. Group NAC-f constituted the largest clade, containing 50 members and accounting for 15% of the total NACs, while group NAC-b formed the second largest clade containing 47 members and accounting for 14% of the total NACs. Noticeably, among the groups identified by phylogenetic analysis, two groups (NAC-f and NAC-m) only contain NACs from rice and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>, and group NAC-g only contains Arabidopsis NACs. This result suggests diversification and expansion of these subgroups after the monocot-eudicot split.</p><p>As reviewed in the introduction, NAC proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in diverse aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, the functions of most members in this family remain unknown. Out of the 101 BdNACs identified in this study, only BdNAC101/BdSWN5 has been characterized to function in regulation of secondary wall synthesis and cell death [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, prediction of the function of BdNACs through homologous analysis is important for the future study of NACs in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>. For example, group NAC-a encompassed the NAC proteins involved in secondary wall synthesis. These NACs include NSTs (NST1, NST2, NST3/SND1) and VNDs (VND1-7) from Arabidopsis and OsSWNs (OsSWN1-7) from rice [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> NAC protein BdNAC101/BdSWN5 in group NAC-a has a similar function for regulation of secondary wall synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggesting that phylogeny-based functional prediction is helpful for NACs functional characterization in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> as that in rice and soybean [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The main purpose of this study was to identify the putative <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes that function in abiotic stress responses. Previous reports of phylogenetic analysis of NAC family found that many stress-responsive NACs are in the SNAC (stress-responsive NAC) group [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that group NAC-n contains most stress-related NACs, and named it as SNAC (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Out of 42 NACs in SNAC group, 13 (31%) NACs have been demonstrated their functions in abiotic stress responses (indicated in red in <xref rid="pone.0122027.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). SNAC group can be further divided into three subgroups: SNAC-I, SNAC-II and SNAC-III (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Senescence is the common consequence of various abiotic stresses. Most members of SNAC-I subgroup have a dual function in abiotic stress responses and senescence regulation, such as ANAC019, ANAC055/AtNAC3, ANAC072/RD26 and VNI2 from Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and OsNAP from rice [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. SNAC-II subgroup contains several well known stress-related NAC genes from Arabidopsis and rice. For example, SNAC1/OsNAC9/OsNAC19 and OsNAC5 enhanced drought and salt resistances [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while SNAC2/OsNAC6 increased salt and cold resistances in transgenic rice [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ATAF1 from Arabidopsis also enhanced plant resistance to drought [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition to their functions in abiotic stress responses, most members of SNAC-II subgroup, such as SNAC1/OsNAC9/OsNAC19, SNAC2/OsNAC6 and ATAF1, were also involved in biotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. ATAF2 and OsNAC4 in SNAC-II subgroup play a role in biotic stress response [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but their functions in abiotic stresses remain unknown. ANAC096 in SNAC-III subgroup functioned in dehydration and osmotic stress responses through direct interaction with ABF2 and ABF4 [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition to SNAC group, abiotic stress-related NACs were also mainly distributed in group NAC-b, NAC-c, NAC-j and NAC-k (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-F</xref>). NAC-b contains NACs functioning in development (such as CUC1-3). Recently, some members were found to be involved in abiotic stress responses. ORE1/ANAC092/AtNAC2 plays an important role in salt-promoted senescence [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Jeong et al. [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that overexpression of <italic>OsNAC10</italic> increased grain yield significantly under field drought condition. Fang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported that four miR164-targeted NAC genes (<italic>OMTN2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic> and <italic>6</italic>) negatively regulated drought resistance in rice. JUB1/ANAC042 in group NAC-c delayed senescence and enhanced resistance to various abiotic stresses by modulating cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level and DREB2A regulated network [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Membrane-bound NAC transcription factor NTL4 in group NAC-j promoted production of reactive oxygen species during drought-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Two membrane-bound NAC transcription factors in group NAC-k, ANAC013 and ANAC017, were direct positive regulators of <italic>AOX1a</italic> and functioned in mitochondrial retrograde regulation of the oxidative stress response in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Heat map representation for transcript expression fold change in response to abiotic stresses was shown in <xref rid="pone.0122027.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>. Based on the cluster analysis, the expression of 6 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes was induced by drought but repressed by heat stress, and 59 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were induced by multiple stresses except drought stress, while other 36 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were mainly repressed by all four abiotic stresses. More than 50% of the <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were down-regulated under drought stress condition. Whereas, 34 (33%) <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were up-regulated under heat stress condition. Among the 101 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes, 53 and 73 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated under at least one stress condition, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B and C</xref>). Additionally, 26 and 23 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were up-regulated and down-regulated under more than one stress condition, respectively. For examples, <italic>BdNAC034</italic> and <italic>BdNAC036</italic> were up-regulated by both salinity and cold treatments, while <italic>BdNAC013</italic>, <italic>BdNAC032</italic>, <italic>BdNAC052</italic> and <italic>BdNAC066</italic> were down-regulated by both drought and heat treatments. Some of the <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes exhibited induction under specific stress condition, for example, <italic>BdNAC008</italic>, <italic>BdNAC022</italic>, <italic>BdNAC024</italic> and <italic>BdNAC037</italic> were induced specifically under drought stress condition, while <italic>BdNAC006</italic>, <italic>BdNAC041</italic>, <italic>BdNAC048</italic> and <italic>BdNAC067</italic> were up-regulated only by high salinity treatment.

As NAC TFs are plant-specific proteins, we also searched NAC proteins in six major types of model organisms whose genomes have been already sequenced, including red alga (<italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</italic>), the chlorophytes (<italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic>, <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic>, <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, and <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>), the moss (<italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>), the lycophyte (<italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>), the monocots (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>, and <italic>Zea mays</italic>), and the eudicots (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Glycine max</italic>, and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>). The result showed that the plant-specific NAC genes do not exist in unicellular or multicellular algae, and only found in land plants (<xref rid="pone.0122027.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>.). Small number of NAC genes has been found in moss and lycophyte, while angiosperms possess a large number of NAC genes. The results indicated that the NAC TFs may arise after plants transitioned from water to land, and are particularly important for plant tissue organization and adverse environmental adaptation. More than 100 NAC genes were identified in most angiosperms, while <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> and tomato had the fewest except grape. The presence of such large number of NACs in plants indicated great functional diversity and amplification of this gene family during evolution.</p><p>In this study, 101 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were identified in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> genome. The 101 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes are unevenly distributed on all the 5 chromosomes of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>, and nine clusters each with 2 <italic>BdNACs</italic> were identified (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Uneven and cluster distribution of NAC family genes was also found in rice, poplar, foxtail millet, potato and soybean [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. NAC membrane-bound TFs (MTFs) have been implicated in plant response to various abiotic stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Genome-wide analysis identified 18 NAC MTFs (NTLs) in Arabidopsis and 5 NAC MTFs (OsNTLs) in rice. Seven NAC proteins containing single TM were also identified in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>. All the Arabidopsis and rice NAC MTFs contain single TM at their C-terminal. However, one of the BdNAC MTFs, BdNAC076, had TM region at N-terminal (<xref rid="pone.0122027.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.). Segmental duplication, tandem duplication and transposition events were the main reasons for gene family expansion. 9 (8.9%) and 35 (34.7%) <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were found to be tandem and segmental duplications, respectively. While, at whole genome level, 2945 (11.1%) and 4889 (18.2%) genes were identified as tandem and segmental duplications, respectively. These observations are consistent with a preferential retention of transcription factors after whole genome duplications [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Many NAC proteins are implicated in diverse plant developmental and physiological processes, including root development [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], leaf senescence [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], secondary walls formation [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as various abiotic and biotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122027.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We are particularly interested in identification of NAC genes involving in response to abiotic stresses in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>. Phylogenetic analysis of NAC gene family in rice found that most of the stress-responsive NACs belonged to one group (namely stress-responsive NAC group, SNAC) [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analysis of NACs from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>, Arabidopsis and rice revealed that group NAC-n contains most stress-related NACs (named it as SNAC), and the SNAC group can be further divided into three subgroups (SNAC-I, SNAC-II and SNAC-III). On the basis of sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses, 18 <italic>BdNACs</italic> with highly homologous to known stress-related NAC proteins from Arabidopsis and rice were identified as putative stress-related <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, <italic>cis</italic>-elements and expression profiles analysis of <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes provided further evidence for their roles in stress tolerance. A total of 5 stress-related <italic>cis</italic>-elements were detected in the promoter regions of the <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes by search against the PlantCARE database, and 92 out of the 101 <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes had at least one of the stress-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements. Our qPCR results showed that the expression of 90% of all <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were response to at least one of the stress conditions, suggesting that these <italic>cis</italic>-elements may play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to abiotic stresses. It is remarkable that the expressions of <italic>BdNAC003</italic>, ortholog of rice <italic>SNAC1</italic> genes, was highly induced by drought, high salinity, cold and heat stresses among the 18 putative stress-related <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122027.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>.). And the promoter of <italic>BdNAC003</italic> contains stress-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements such as DRE and HSE. Whereas, rice <italic>SNAC2</italic> ortholog, <italic>BdNAC044</italic>, which has MBS and LTR, was induced by salinity, cold and heat stresses. Many <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were down-regulated under abiotic stress conditions, indicating that these proteins might act as negative regulators in stress responses. Some NAC proteins have been reported for their negative regulatory roles in response to abiotic stresses. For example, four miR164-targeted NAC genes (<italic>OMTN2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic> and <italic>6</italic>) were characterized as negative regulators of drought resistance in rice [<xref rid="pone.0122027.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this report, we found that <italic>BdNAC054</italic> and <italic>BdNAC092</italic>, ortholog of <italic>OMTN6</italic> and <italic>OMTN2</italic>, respectively, were substantially down-regulated by drought stress (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122027.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>.). These results indicated that function of some NAC proteins might be conserved among species. About half of the 18 candidate stress-related <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes, which contain at least one of the phytohormone-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements, were induced by ABA and other phytohormone treatments (<xref rid="pone.0122027.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122027.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>.), indicating that <italic>BdNACs</italic> may function in abiotic stress response medicated by phytohormones such as ABA. The functions of these stress-responsive <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes in abiotic stress resistance will be further characterized in subsequent work.</p><p>Taken together, NAC family was comprehensive characterized in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> in this study and several candidate stress-responsive <italic>BdNAC</italic> genes were identified based on the phylogenetic and expression profile analyses. Our results presented here would be helpful in laying the foundation for understanding of the complex mechanisms of abiotic stress signaling controlled by NAC proteins in <italic>B</italic>.
