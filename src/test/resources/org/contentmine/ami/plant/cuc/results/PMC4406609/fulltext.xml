Kuntze, <italic>Theaceae</italic>] is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Cold stress is one of the most severe abiotic stresses that limit tea plants&#x02019; growth, survival and geographical distribution. However, the genetic regulatory network and signaling pathways involved in cold stress responses in tea plants remain unearthed. Using RNA-Seq, DGE and sRNA-Seq technologies, we performed an integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiling and their regulatory network of tea plants under chilling (4&#x02103;) and freezing (-5&#x02103;) stress. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNA and mRNA profiles were obtained based on fold change analysis, miRNAs and target mRNAs were found to show both coherent and incoherent relationships in the regulatory network. Furthermore, we compared several key pathways (e.g., &#x02018;Photosynthesis&#x02019;), GO terms (e.g., &#x02018;response to karrikin&#x02019;) and transcriptional factors (TFs, e.g., DREB1b/CBF1) which were identified as involved in the early chilling and/or freezing response of tea plants. Intriguingly, we found that karrikins, a new group of plant growth regulators, and &#x003b2;-primeverosidase (BPR), a key enzyme functionally relevant with the formation of tea aroma might play an important role in both early chilling and freezing response of tea plants. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis further confirmed the results from RNA-Seq and sRNA-Seq analysis. This is the first study to simultaneously profile the expression patterns of both miRNAs and mRNAs on a genome-wide scale to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of early responses of tea plants to cold stress. In addition to gaining a deeper insight into the cold resistant characteristics of tea plants, we provide a good case study to analyse mRNA/miRNA expression and profiling of non-model plant species using next-generation sequencing technology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31470027 to ZD), (School Fund Project of Qingdao Agricultural University, 631412, the Livelihood Project of Qingdao City (No. 13-1-3-85-nsh to ZD) and the Breeding Project of Shandong Province (No. 2012LZ12-03, 2013LZ12-03, 2014LZ12-03 to ZD).

O. Kuntze) is the most popular health drink in the world, and the tea plant is one of the most important commercial beverage crops in Kenya, China, Sri Lanka, India, among others [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The tea plant, as a perennial evergreen woody crop, is constantly exposed to environmental changes, requiring transient, rapid and seasonal responses [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Every year significant loss of tea production can result from sudden frosts in fall, unusual freezing stress in winter and early spring frosts. Furthermore, to ensure a prolonged growth period in the high-latitude regions, novel tea plant cultivars with improved cold resistance are in demand.</p><p>Cold stress, including chilling (0&#x02013;15&#x000b0;C) and freezing (&#x0003c; 0&#x000b0;C) temperatures, is a serious environmental stress that disrupts cellular homeostasis and limits plant growth. During the cold stress process, a series of protective mechanisms are triggered while a series of negative effects occur, including the reduced nutrient absorption rates, reduced net and maximal photosynthetic rates, and the inhibition of plant growth [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. On the other hand, the physiological and biochemical status of cold-stressed plants are also altered, such as transient increases in hormone levels [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and alternating the composition of the membrane lipid [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the accumulation of numerous cryoprotectants, such as glycine betaine, proline and trehalose [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the enhancement of antioxidative mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are also occurred. These changes are, at least in part, mediated through the differential expression of many genes [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These genes are thought to be induced either by cold <italic>per se</italic> or by the relative state of dehydration that is brought about by cold stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many of these COR (cold-regulated) genes have been identified by transcriptome analysis. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, for example, several hundred transcripts have been reported to respond to cold [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, in the woody plants, a large number of genes have also been shown to be cold responsive (e.g., <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mongolicus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <italic>J</italic>. <italic>curcas</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). To date, some COR genes have been isolated from tea plants [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) have presented the first whole transcriptome analysis of tea plants during the cold acclimation process using RNA-Seq combined with digital gene expression (DGE) analysis [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A large number of cold-responsive genes involved in diverse biological processes or pathways were identified during the cold acclimation process. However, the whole transcriptome-level changes of early cold response in tea plants remain unclear, and the differences between chilling and freezing response mechanisms in tea plants are far from being fully understood. Moreover, cold perception is also associated with changes at the post-translational levels [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Numerous cold-responsive transcription factors (TFs), such as AP2-EREBP (APETALA2/ET-Responsive Element Binding Protein), MYB (Myeloblastosis), NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2), WRKY (named after the WRKY amino acid motif), and bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) have been studied extensively in model plants [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition to transcription factors, other signaling components mediating cold response process, including kinases, enzymes involved in hormone biosynthesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, are also regulated at the post-translational level [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous single-stranded non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) of approximately 21 nt in length; these RNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through base-pairing to target mRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To date, increasing number of studies indicate that plant miRNAs are involved in various biotic and/or abiotic stress responses such as drought [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], high salinity [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], extreme temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], nutrient deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Though numbers of miRNAs were identified from various crop plant species, there was still no registered <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> miRNA in miRBase (Release 20.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Recently, Mohanpuria and Yadav [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] discovered six novel small RNAs candidates from tea using a direct cloning approach for the first time. Das and Mondal [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Prabu and Mandal [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Zhu and Luo [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] identified several miRNAs from tea plants by expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis, and more attention was given to the function of tea miRNAs. Most recently, Anburaj <italic>et al</italic>. analysed the function of several tea miRNAs within the bud tissues using stem-loop pulse RT-qPCR method [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Despite these efforts, our knowledge of the role played by miRNAs in tea plants&#x02019; cold stress response is still limited at the whole-genome level. Moreover, little attention has been paid to understanding how genes, transcription factors and miRNAs expression are integrated into the dynamic and complex regulatory network which act together to alter regulation and finally contribute to the enhancement of chilling and freezing tolerance in tea plants.</p><p>Insights in miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks facilitate the understanding of fine-tuning of gene expression at post-transcriptional level. However, in silico predictions of miRNA-mRNA interactions do not take into account the specific transcriptomic status of the biological system and are biased by false positives. For example, miRNAs may indirectly interact with mRNAs through other TFs, miRNAs or endo-siRNAs (e.g. trans-acting siRNAs, ta-siRNAs) besides direct base pairing [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consequently, indirect mRNA modulatory effects of miRNAs to decrease or increase target mRNAs may be frequent or even greatly outnumber direct target suppressions [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One possible solution to predict rather reliable miRNA-mRNA relations in the specific biological context is to integrate real mRNA and miRNA transcriptomic data as well as in silico target predictions. Next-generation sequencing technologies such as RNA-Seq and DGE have proved to be cost-effective and high-throughput means to analyze the transcriptome in non-model species [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. RNA-Seq approach can also be served to analyze the sRNAs of the transcriptome when libraries are constructed from low-molecular weight RNA fractions [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These technologies offer several advantages compared with existing technologies such as EST sequencing and microarrays [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here, we provided a two-dimensional map of the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles on tea leaves subjected to chilling (4&#x000b0;C) and freezing (-5&#x000b0;C) temperatures for 4- or 8-h. We identify a complex and dynamic network of genes, transcription factors and miRNAs involved in the regulation of early cold response. In addition to gaining a deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms of early cold response, the differences between chilling and freezing response in tea plants are discovered. The results of this study should contribute to biotechnological manipulation with the aim of improving the cold resistance of tea plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Analysis of transcriptome sequencing</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Sequencing and assembly</title><p>RNA isolated from the control (25&#x000b0;C, CK) and four cold-treated [chilling treatment (4&#x000b0;C, CT) for 4- and 8-h (CT4 and CT8); freezing treatment (-5&#x000b0;C, FT) for 4- and 8-h (FT4 and FT8)] tea leaves were equally mixed to construct a broad cDNA library associated with cold response.

Given that miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of their target mRNAs by target RNA cleavage, the expression patterns of miRNA target genes generally show an inverse correlation with those of miRNAs. Therefore, for the majority of cases that involve target cleavage, the simple expectation is that, when miRNAs are induced by cold stress, their target mRNAs are reduced and vice versa. Whereas, our study describes here the 7 significantly down-regulated miRNAs (i.e., csn-miR164.4, csn-miR164.1, csn-miR171.2, csn-miR156.11, csn-miR169.6, csn-miR167.6 and csn-miR156.17) and 4 significantly up-regulated DE miRNAs (i.e., csn-miR157.2, csn-miR398.5, csn-miR398.2 and csn-miR169.2) under cold treatments showed both negative and positive correlation with target mRNAs (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>).

We performed an integrative analysis of these data and obtained the complete set of early cold-responsive miRNAs/mRNAs, their interactions and dynamics in the biological process/pathway and the differences in biological process/pathway within and between different cold treatments, which could help us tell the differences between chilling and freezing response mechanisms in tea plants.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Expression and regulatory patterns of cold-responsive miRNAs/mRNAs in tea plants</title><p>Some studies have demonstrated that the stress-responsive miRNA-mRNA regulatory network includes both the coherent and incoherent regulatory patterns [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this work, we attempt to construct the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network according to the DE miRNAs and DE mRNAs datasets, sample categories and miRNA-targeting information. Finally, 22 miRNA-mRNA pairs, including both positive and negative correlation were identified.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="pone.0125031.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network is more subtle and complex than we had believed, especially for selective and complex correlation of miRNAs and target mRNAs. For instance, a single miRNA can target multiple mRNAs (e.g., comp29465_c0, comp55068_c0, comp73221_c0, comp80343_c0, comp81915_c0 and comp91945_c1 can be simultaneously regulated by csn-miR156.17 in CT8 sample). Further, a specific miRNA may regulate certain specific target mRNAs and thus contribute to the response of specific period or temperature of cold treatments (e.g., comp92274_c0, comp55068_c0 and comp92485_c0 can be regulated by csn-miR156.17 in CT4, CT8 and FT8 samples, respectively). Additionally, common target mRNAs might be regulated by multiple cold-responsive miRNAs, even between up- and down-regulated miRNAs (e.g., comp73221_c0 can be negatively regulated by down-regulated csn-miR156.17 and up-regulated csn-miR157.2 in CT8 sample), suggesting that these miRNAs are responsible for both switch on/off and fine-tune target mRNA expression under cold-stress-conditions. In many cases, the expression pattern of the miRNA and its targets show an opposite trend. Although this negative correlation between miRNA and their target mRNAs is often considered proof of miRNA targeting, there are also reported cases of positive correlation at the expression level of miRNA and their target mRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a well-characterized example is the case of miR168 targeting of AGO1. They co-expressed everywhere to maintain a proper balance between the miRNA and AGO1 expression levels when needed, which suggesting the involvement of fine-tuned mechanisms to modulate gene expression through a miRNA mediated feedback loop [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, miRNAs from the same miRNA families displayed different expression patterns (e.g., down-regulated csn-miR169.6 and up-regulated csn-miR169.2 in FT4 sample), implying their different roles in regulating expressions of the cold-responsive mRNAs or that their target mRNAs are diversified (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This is consistent with the results obtained from cold-stressed populus [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and peach [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These cold-responsive miRNA members from the same family may be further differentiated by their spatio-temporal response to cold stress. Therefore, the functions of plant miRNAs can be dissimilar even if they share a high degree of sequence similarity. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that miRNAs may indirectly interact with mRNAs through other TFs, miRNAs or endo-siRNAs (e.g. ta-siRNAs) besides direct base pairing [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Consequently, indirect mRNA modulatory effects of miRNAs to decrease or increase target mRNAs may be frequent or even greatly outnumber direct target suppressions [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Hence, miRNA-mRNA showing both the coherent and incoherent regulatory patterns is not unusual. Further investigation to unravel the TFs and relevant genes responsible for regulating the miRNA expression may shed light on the complex miRNA-mRNA interplay observed in various studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>GO and pathways involved in response to chilling and freezing stress of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic>
</title><p>Functional and pathway assignments of the DE mRNAs and DE miRNAs-mediated targets using GO and KEGG classification revealed numerous hormonal, metabolic, physiological, and developmental responses, which may played vital roles in response to chilling and freezing stress in tea plants. These included alterations in (i) photosynthesis, (ii) protein phosphorylation, (iii) protein autoubiquitination, (iv) transcription factors, (v) carbohydrate metabolism and (vi) plant hormone signal transduction (Figs <xref rid="pone.0125031.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0125031.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> Tables). Photosynthesis is usually the first to be influenced by changing temperatures.

In our study, &#x02018;Photosynthesis&#x02019; and &#x02018;Photosynthesis&#x02014;antenna proteins&#x02019; pathway was significantly enriched in both CT and FT samples, suggesting a role in the early response to cold stress (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Detailed information of &#x02018;Photosynthesis&#x02019; pathway revealed that several photosynthesis related genes were rapidly induced in CT4 and FT4 groups; whereas most photosynthesis related genes were down-regulated or unchanged in CT8 and FT8 samples. Moreover, enrichment of GO terms such as &#x02018;response to hydrogen peroxide&#x02019; (CT samples) and &#x02018;hydrogen peroxide catabolic process&#x02019; (FT samples), and &#x02018;Glutathione metabolism&#x02019; pathway (CT and FT samples) implied that light-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production might occur (Figs <xref rid="pone.0125031.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0125031.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables). Furthermore, the &#x02018;Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450&#x02019; was identified as prominently enriched pathway in both CT and FT samples (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). The members of the P450 superfamily were known to play a role in abiotic stress via their transcriptional up-regulation in response to ROS, which have a dual role in biotic and abiotic stress response of plants [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. While ROS are thought to be one of the main causes of stress-induced damage to proteins, lipids and nucleic acids by oxidative reactions, ROS can also play a key role in mediating stress-related signal transduction events that help the plant in mounting a quick and credible response to mitigate cold-induced damage [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a recent study conducted on poplar, the amount of ROS was produced early in the chilling response resulting in photosynthesis being inhibited and producing a survival advantage [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Taken together, our results were consistent with previous reports that the repression of some genes involved in photosynthesis pathway and the accumulation of ROS may be considered as a result of cold shock response, which could have active functions such as the protection from the photodamage in tea plants.</p><p>Post-translational modifications are reversible, constituting very versatile mechanisms that allow plants to finely adjust their responses to cold stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The disruption of phosphorylation has a significant impact on the ability of plants to acclimate to cold stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Several protein kinases belonging to diverse families have shown to be involved in the perception of environmental signals, such as histidine kinases (HKs), serine/threonine-protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). HKs are the major signaling elements and are involved in the multistep two-component signaling system for perception and transduction of cold stress signaling [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In chrysanthemum, both the serine/threonine-protein kinases and MAPK pathway are involved in the processes of cold acclimation and chilling/freezing response [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Here, csn-miR156.17 was significantly down-regulated (5.2-fold) with its target gene AHK4 was up-regulated (1.1-fold) in FT8 sample. Therefore, it can be expected that the two-component signaling pathways might be activated by repressing the csn-miR156.17 in tea plants and so enhance the adaptability to freezing stress (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). Although csn-miR398.5 functions as a repressor, we showed here that it is co-expressed in CT8 sample with its target gene HT1 (Serine/threonine-protein kinase HT1) in which miRNAs fine-tune or maintain transcriptionally established gene expression patterns under chilling stress (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). We confirmed by qRT-PCR that AHK4 and HT1 expression is induced in both, which indicates that protein kinases as well as their regulating miRNAs play an important role in the early chilling/freezing response of tea plants (Fig <xref rid="pone.0125031.g008" ref-type="fig">8A,8K,8M and 8N</xref>). MAPKs are implicated in the signaling of most plant hormones and developmental processes, and also acted as the converging points of various abiotic stress signalling pathways. [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As indicated in <xref rid="pone.0125031.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, &#x02018;MAPK signaling pathway&#x02019; was significantly enriched in both CT4 and CT8 samples (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Furthermore, in the GO cluster of &#x02018;response to stimulus&#x02019;, the network patterns of treatment groups showed that a wide range of stress responses were aroused by cold stress in both CT and FT samples (e.g., 'response to water deprivation' and 'response to high light intensity'), which were probably due to the contribution of MAPKs and other cross-tolerance mechanisms of tea plants (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). MAPKs were known to be activated by cold-induced ROS, which further suggesting the generation of ROS in the early cold response [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Additionally, the effects of ROS on components of the MAPK cascades have shown to result in the indirect activation of transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in plant development and stress response [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, at least five TF families have been reported to be linked to cold stress resistance in plants, including NAC, MYB, bHLH, WRKY, and AP2-EREBP [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One group of well-studied transcription factors involved in cold responses is the AP2-EREBP family members, which have been subdivided into four major subfamilies: the DREB/CBF, AP2, ERF and RAV subfamilies [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Of these, the DREB/CBF subfamily has been reported to play a major role in the early stages of the cold response [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], as evidenced by studies in numerous species such as <italic>Anthurium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and rice [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], as well as tea plant [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This family contains 24, 23, 6 and 5 up-regulated members in the CT4, CT8, FT4 and FT8 groups, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Surprisingly, none of the DREB1s/CBFs (DREB1b/CBF1, DREB1c /CBF2 and DREB1a/CBF3) homologous gene was found in the FT4 and FT8 groups though CBF1 (comp79005_c0) and CBF2 (comp73809_c0) were both significantly up-regulated over 7-fold in the CT4 and CT8 groups, suggesting a key role of the DREB1/CBF TFs in tea plants&#x02019; chilling but not freezing stress perception/response. Their cold-induced expression evident from the RNA-seq was further confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). Some RAP homologs (e.g. comp89295_c0) and ERF homologs (e.g. comp98269_c0), which were seldom studied in cold response were mostly up-regulated in all treatment groups, indicating their potential role in cold response (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>The majority of WRKY family members are known to be responsive to various abiotic stresses and function as regulators of plant basal disease resistance [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A growing body of evidence has shown that WRKY proteins are involved in responses to cold stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is notable that 11 out of 15 and 18 out of 21 WRKY family members in CT4 and CT8 groups were up-regulated in response to chilling stress, respectively. Whereas all the WRKY family members were found down-regulated in FT groups (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The results not only suggest that tea plants may respond to chilling and freezing stress with different strategies but also indicate a crosstalk between plant-pathogen interaction and cold stress response may occur.</p><p>A comprehensive expression analysis of MYB superfamily showed that most of MYB genes are responsive to various phytohormones and stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The majority of bHLH TFs show late down-regulation under cold stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Furthermore, some reports suggest that MYB and bHLH TFs often interact with each other to control transcription [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In the present study, most of the MYB or MYB-related family members showed down-regulation in CT8, FT4 and FT8 groups. The bHLH family members were mostly induced in CT groups, while the majority of which were repressed in FT groups (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Therefore, based on our analysis, we speculated that distinct ratios of these partner factors may be required in response to different cold conditions.</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned TFs, the plant-specific NAC family members have been implicated in plant development (e.g., seed development, embryo development, shoot apical meristem formation, and leaf senescence) [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], as well as multiple abiotic and biotic stress responses (e.g., drought, salinity, cold and virus infections) [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. We have identified 6, 15, 7 and 5 NAC TF genes were up-regulated in response to cold stress, while only 2, 0, 0 and 3 members of NAC family genes showed repressed expression in CT4, CT8, FT4 and FT8 groups, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The over-representation of this TF family may indicate their importance in tea plants&#x02019; cold response. Some studies have suggested that the miR164 family members guide the cleavage of the NAC genes to modulate developmental processes, as well as abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. To date, the functions of the miR164 and its targeted NAC genes in tea plants are poorly deciphered. Our results show that down-regulated csn-miR164.1/4 (2.0-fold) and its targeted NAC gene (comp90399_c1, up-regulated by 2.0-fold) in CT8 samples may be positive regulators of chilling response in tea plants, apart from their reported roles in development (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>, Figs <xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.g008" ref-type="fig">8D, 8O and 8Q</xref>). However, in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>trichocarpa</italic>, miR164 was reported to be up-regulated within 8 h of the cold stress treatment, and then showed a decrease trend [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Such discrepancies on the expression pattern of miRNAs may be due to variations in either technical reasons or experimental conditions. Nevertheless, it is also possible that these miRNAs play a species-specific role in cold responses. Besides, miR167 is reported to be involved in regulating the auxin signal by cleavage of two auxin response factors (i.e., ARF6 and ARF8) [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The plant hormone auxin regulates various growth and developmental processes as well as responses to environmental stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In our study, cold-induced increases of ARF6 (comp92148_c2, 1.1-fold) were modulated by down-regulation (5.1-fold) of csn-miR167.6 in FT4 group, indicating that csn-miR167.6 might play a potential role in freezing stress response by affecting the auxin signaling pathway in tea plants (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>, Figs <xref rid="pone.0125031.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.g008" ref-type="fig">8E and 8P</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these conserved targets of known miRNA families which code for transcription factors or kinases known to control key steps in plant development, such as miR156-SPL, miR164-NAC, miR167-ARF6, miR398-HT1 and miR156-AHK4, have also been found to be regulated by environmental stresses and thus may serve to integrate stress responses/memory with development. This kind of regulatory cascade is especially significant for early cold-response by modulating the expression of stress-regulated genes among multiple stress perception and signalling pathways in plants. In addition, most of them were also experimentally validated by using either RLM-RACE (a modified RNA ligase mediated random amplification of cDNA ends) or degradome sequencing in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], which further validate the robustness of our method to predict rather reliable miRNA-mRNA duplexes in the specific biological context.</p><p>Cold stress also induce the rapid accumulation of soluble carbohydrates in plants. As indicated in <xref rid="pone.0125031.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, the enzymes up-regulated in CT samples involved in starch turnover were &#x003b2;-amylase (BAM) and glucan phosphorylase (GP), each has been reported to be induced by abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125031.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Beta-glucosidases (BGLUs) are implicated in the timely response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plant through activation of defense compounds and plant hormones [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. We observed that BGLU17 was uniquely induced in FT4 group, whereas BGLU11 was repressed in CT4, CT8 and FT8 groups in response to cold stress. In addition, the expression levels of crucial enzymes (TPPA/J, trehalose-phosphate phosphatase A/J and TPS5, alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase [UDP-forming] 5) for synthesizing trehalose increased under cold stress. Among them, TPS5 and TPPA were induced in FT4 and CT8 groups, respectively; TPPJ displayed an increase in CT4, CT8 and FT4 groups, indicating the important role of trehalose in tea plants&#x02019; cold resistance. Intriguingly, we notice that &#x003b2;-primeverosidase (BPR), a key enzyme involved in the formation of tea aroma were identified as being quickly induced in CT4, FT4 and FT8 groups, which may be explained by the fact that the BPR hydrolyzes &#x003b2;-primeverosides to liberate a primeverose unit and aglycons such as methyl salicylate to induces various defense responses in response to biotic and/or abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Additional evidence for cold-induced expression changes of BPR among treatment groups were provided by qRT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>). Thus, further investigation should be conducted to clarify the correlation between tea leaf BPR/tea quality (aroma) and cold stress, which can shed light on and enhance our knowledge of the function of BPR in tea plants.</p><fig id="pone.0125031.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0125031.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Differential expression of carbohydrate metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction related genes.</title><p>The histograms showing the number of up- or down-regulated carbohydrate metabolism (A) and plant hormone signal transduction (B) related genes in CT4, CT8, FT4 and FT8 samples, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0125031.g009"/></fig><p>Phytohormones are essential for the ability of plants to adapt to abiotic stresses by mediating a wide range of adaptive responses [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. &#x02018;Plant hormone signal transduction&#x02019; pathway comprised 12, 6, 5 and 4 genes of pathway-hit genes in CT4, CT8, FT4 and FT8 groups, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). In this pathway, the transcripts of TIFY9/10A (Protein TIFY 9/10A), SAUR (auxin-responsive protein), NPR5 (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related gene 5), GH3.1 (Indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase GH3.1), ERF2/10 (Ethylene-responsive transcription factor 2/10), and ARR10 (Two-component response regulator ARR10) were determined to be up-regulated, while the transcripts of XTH22 (Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein 22), EIN2 (Ethylene-insensitive protein 2), BSK (BR-signaling kinase) were identified as being down-regulated in CT samples. Additionally, we found that the expression levels of RAP1 (Transcription factor MYC2) and ERF1B (Ethylene responsive element binding protein) transcripts were determined to be up-regulated, while the transcripts of GH3.6 (Indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase GH3.6) and AIP1 (Protein phosphatase 2C 3) were detected to be down-regulated in both CT and FT samples. Notably, the transcripts of ARR2 (Two-component response regulator ARR2) and AHK4 were found to be down- and up-regulated exclusively by freezing exposure, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). Their homologous genes were identified as being involved in jasmonic acid (JA), auxin (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), brassinosteroid (BR), and ethylene (ETH) mediate hormone signal transduction in plants [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In addition to ABA and ETH, it is now known that various phytohormones such as JA, SA, and IAA crosstalk extensively to regulate practically all aspects of plant stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, the biological process &#x02018;response to karrikin&#x02019; was found to be enriched in both CT and FT groups (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125031.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, the up-regulation of the comp74326_c0 unigene (GI) and the down-regulation of the comp66051_c1 unigene (GST3) involved in &#x02018;response to karrikin&#x02019; were also validated by qRT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="pone.0125031.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8G and 8H</xref>). Karrikins are a group of recently discovered plant growth regulators identified in smoke from wildfires [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In addition to alleviating dormancy, crosstalk with other signalling systems including hormones, light and abiotic stress has also been identified [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. For example, the GO term &#x02018;response to karrikin&#x02019; was previously found to be enriched after chilling stress in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>bungeana</italic> by transcriptome analysis [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. It was previously shown that smoke/karrikin could enhanced the ubiquitination of proteins and activated protein degradation related genes, and the occurrence of stress-related genes induced by smoke/karrikin were robust and are extensive among the responses, especially cold, heat and biotic stresses in the early post-germination phase [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Protein autoubiquitination may play similar roles as protein phosphorylation to be a rapid pathway to get tolerance in plant responses to chilling stress and have important roles in plant cold acclimation [<xref rid="pone.0125031.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. It is of great interest that the processe &#x0201c;protein autoubiquitination&#x0201d; was over-represented in CT4, CT8 and FT4 groups, which may interferes with the karrikin-related signal transduction (<xref rid="pone.0125031.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). It is highly possible that the karrikin &#x02018;signal&#x02019; is perceived by a receptor that is shared with the signal transduction system implied in perceiving environmental cues (especially stresses and light), and thus act as a potential hardening factor to increase cold tolerance of tea plants. Therefore, it is also worthwhile and necessary to further clarify correlation between the karrikins and the cold response mechanisms in plants. In the near future, extensive transcriptome and post-transcriptome analysis of tea plants treated with smoke/karrikin and exposed to different stresses will be carried out in our laboratory to draw the map of possible interactions of smoke and stress related pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exploration to simultaneously characterize the transcriptome and miRNome of tea plants respond to chilling and freezing stress. A large number of mRNAs and miRNAs from tea plants involved in diverse biological processes/pathways were identified. Furthermore, the comparison of several key pathways (e.g., &#x02018;Photosynthesis&#x02019;), GO terms (e.g., &#x02018;response to karrikin&#x02019;) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g., DREB1b/CBF1) provided informative results, which could help us tell the differences between chilling and freezing response mechanisms in tea plants. Compared with short-term chilling treatment, fewer genes were found to be differentially expressed after transient freezing treatment. Whereas more post-transcriptional control by miRNAs might occur in tea plants respond to freezing stress. Moreover, we highlighted the diverse regulatory patterns of target gene expression by early cold-responsive miRNAs. In addition to coherent modulation by miRNAs, incoherent correlations between miRNAs and their target mRNAs provide another layer of gene regulatory networks in a cold-responsive pathway. Interestingly, we found that karrikins, a new group of plant growth regulators, might act as a potential hardening factor to increase cold tolerance of tea plants. Furthermore, our result suggest that &#x003b2;-primeverosidase, a key enzyme functionally relevant with the formation of tea aroma might be involved in both chilling and freezing response of tea plants. Hence, it is of paramount interest to draw the map of possible interactions of smoke/karrikin, BPR and stress related pathways by conducting extensive transcriptome and post-transcriptome analysis of tea plants treated with smoke/karrikin and different stresses.</p><p>Despite the apparent conceptual simplicity of the construction of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks by integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA data, the coherent and incoherent relationships between miRNAs and their target mRNAs are complex and dynamic; and the miRNA, TF or endo-siRNA (e.g. ta-siRNAs) mediated interactions are not yet well-characterized. Thus, the combination of multilevel high throughput deep sequencing datasets [e.g., mRNA and miRNA expression profiling data, ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing) data of transcription factors and degradome sequencing data] with bioinformatics analysis could serve as a powerful tool to build better network-based molecular models to predict, test and identify robust cold-stress-responsive miRNA-mRNA pairs. Moreover, systemic analysis of miRNA-mRNA regulatory network from diverse tissues or cell types and during time courses is required, which could provide a better understanding of gene regulatory network in stress response pathways. Taken together, although this study cannot completely account for cold tolerance in tea plants, we provided a molecular basis elucidating the mechanism of tea plants respond to early chilling and freezing stress and provide a good case study to joint analysis of mRNA and its regulation by miRNA in plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec018"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec019"><title>Plant material, growth conditions and treatments</title><p>The tea plant cultivar &#x02018;<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.)
