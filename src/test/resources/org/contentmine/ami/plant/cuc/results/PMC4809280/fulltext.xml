One of these polymerases, Pol III, has previously been reported to transcribe 5S rRNA, tRNAs, and a number of small RNAs. However, in-depth functional analysis is complicated by the fact that knockout mutations in Pol subunits are typically lethal. Here, we report the characterization of the first known viable Pol III subunit mutant, <italic>nrpc7-1</italic>. This mutant was originally isolated from a forward genetic screen designed to identify enhancers of the autoimmune mutant <italic>snc1</italic>, which contains a gain-of-function mutation in a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor-encoding gene. The <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutation occurs in an intron&#x02013;exon splice site and results in intron retention in some <italic>NRPC7</italic> transcripts. There is a global disruption in RNA equilibrium in <italic>nrpc7-1</italic>, exemplified by the altered expression of a number of RNA molecules, some of which are not reported to be transcribed by Pol III. There are developmental defects associated with the mutation, as homozygous mutant plants are dwarf, have stunted roots and siliques, and possess serrated leaves. These defects are possibly due to altered small RNA stability or activity. Additionally, the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutation confers an <italic>NLR</italic>-specific alternative splicing defect that correlates with enhanced disease resistance, highlighting the importance of alternative splicing in regulating NLR activity. Altogether, these results reveal novel roles for Pol III in maintaining RNA homeostasis, adjusting the expression of a diverse suite of genes, and indirectly modulating gene splicing. Future analyses using the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutant will be instrumental in examining other unknown Pol III functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>NRPC7</kwd><kwd>plant immunity</kwd><kwd>Pol III</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase III</kwd><kwd>Rpc25.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription under both static and dynamic conditions requires the action of evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit enzymes known as DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pols). All eukaryotes possess three distinct RNA polymerases (Pols I, II, and III), each of which transcribes specific suites of genes (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Cramer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Pol I transcribes 45S rRNA, which is the precursor to 5.8S, 18S and 25S rRNAs. Pol II transcribes mRNAs as well as most small nuclear (sn)RNAs and micro (mi)RNAs. Pol III was previously thought to be primarily required for the transcription of &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; genes such as those encoding 5S rRNA and tRNAs. However, recent reports indicate that the Pol III transcriptome is more diverse than formerly assumed (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Dieci <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). There are two additional plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, which are required for the biogenesis and functional activity of small interfering (si)RNAs (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Haag and Pikaard, 2011</xref>). As knockout mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of Pols I, II, and III are lethal, there is a dearth of functional analysis of plant Pols.</p><p content-type="indent">While there are a number of published studies examining global transcriptomic changes in plants under various conditions (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Nagano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Woo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), the literature to date has largely focused on the roles played by Pol II-transcribed RNAs in regulating plants&#x02019; responses to stimuli. Stimulus-induced alteration of expression of protein-coding genes has been extensively documented. Numerous recent reports have highlighted the importance of miRNAs in regulating a broad spectrum of biological processes including development (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wu, 2013</xref>), flowering time (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Spanudakis and Jackson, 2014</xref>), drought stress (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ding <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), metal toxicity (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), immunity (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Staiger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and phytohormone crosstalk (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Curaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), among others. Furthermore, the biosynthesis, functional mechanisms, and degradation pathways of miRNAs have been well studied (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Rogers and Chen, 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Comparatively little is known about Pol III-transcribed RNAs and how they aid plants in responding to intrinsic and extrinsic signals. An RNA molecule with significant sequence and structural similarity to 5S rRNA was found to regulate alternative splicing of certain pre-mRNAs in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Hammond <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, studies in a variety of eukaryotes indicate that Pol III-transcribed non-coding RNAs may play regulatory roles in addition to their housekeeping functions (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Among the various stimuli to which plants are subjected, biotic stress in the form of pathogenic infection requires that plants be able to respond rapidly and initiate signalling cascades specific to the type of pathogen being encountered. While plants possess physical barriers and broad spectrum resistance that is activated by conserved features of pathogenic microbes, many pathogens are able to deliver infection-promoting effector molecules into the plant cell, thereby bypassing this layer of plant immunity (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bigeard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, the plant genome contains a large number of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs; also referred to as Nod-like receptors due to their structural similarity to mammalian proteins of the same name), which either directly bind to pathogenic effectors or detect their activities within the plant cell in a highly specific manner (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Upon recognition of its cognate effector, NLR activation results in rapidly induced and robust defence responses. Plant NLRs can be sorted into two classes based on their N-termini: some possess a Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain and are thus termed TNLs, while others contain a coiled-coil (CC) domain and are referred to as CNLs.</p><p content-type="indent">NLR-mediated signalling must be tightly controlled under both resting and induced conditions, as improper signalling through this pathway may lead to either enhanced disease susceptibility or autoimmunity. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying NLR-mediated signalling are only partially understood. A successful forward genetic suppressor screen previously conducted in our lab used the gain-of-function autoimmune TNL mutant <italic>suppressor of npr1, constitutive 1</italic> (<italic>snc1</italic>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) to search for positive regulators of immunity (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). More recently, we have undertaken a forward genetic screen to identify negative regulators of NLR-mediated immunity.</p><p content-type="indent">Here, we report the characterization of <italic>nrpc7-1</italic>, a partial loss-of-function allele of the gene encoding the Arabidopsis orthologue of yeast Rpc25, a Pol III subunit. This mutant was isolated from our MUSE (MUTANT, <italic>snc1</italic>-ENHANCING) forward genetic screen conducted in the <italic>modifier of snc1 4</italic> (<italic>mos4</italic>) <italic>snc1</italic> double mutant background. A null mutation in <italic>NRPC7</italic> is lethal, while a mutation in an intron&#x02013;exon splice site junction gives rise to intronic retention in some <italic>NRPC7</italic> transcripts, resulting in viable mutant plants. While the <italic>nrpc7-1 mos4 snc1</italic> triple mutant displays enhanced resistance against the virulent oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (<italic>H.a.</italic>) Noco2, the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> single mutant exhibits wild type-level resistance. This correlates with the altered splicing of <italic>SNC1</italic> observed in the triple mutant but not in the single mutant. Morphologically, the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutant is dwarf and has serrated leaves, short roots, and stunted siliques, although flowering time does not appear to be affected. The expression and potentially activity of a number of RNAs are distorted in <italic>nrpc7-1</italic>, contributing to its developmental defects. In keeping with its known function, we observed that the NRPC7 protein localizes to the nucleus. This is the first reported viable Pol III subunit mutant in Arabidopsis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant growth conditions and mutant isolation</title><p>Plants were grown either on soil or on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.3% phytagel.

Indeed, <italic>SNC1</italic> splicing is defective in the <italic>nrpc7-1 mos4 snc1</italic> triple mutant background, in that there is a dramatic accretion of a transcript variant that retains both the second and third introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, C). A similar pattern was observed for the NLR-encoding gene <italic>RPS4</italic>. The second intron of <italic>SNC1</italic> contains an in-frame premature stop codon, and thus retention of this intron should yield a truncated version of the protein. Previous reports have shown that an accumulation of the N-termini of TNL proteins is sufficient to activate cell death and immunity (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Weaver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Swiderski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This finding, combined with our data showing that transcription and translation of <italic>SNC1</italic> are not enhanced by the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw020/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3A, B</ext-link>), suggests that the modification in <italic>SNC1</italic> splicing could be the primary cause of the <italic>snc1</italic> enhancing effects of the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutation in the <italic>mos4 snc1</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">It is notable that the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> single mutant does not differ from wild type in either alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, C) or disease resistance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw020/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link>). This suggests that the <italic>mos4</italic> mutation is required in the genetic background for the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic>-associated splicing defects to become obvious. MOS4 is an integral component of the evolutionarily conserved MOS4-associated complex (MAC) that functions together with the spliceosome to regulate pre-mRNA splicing (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Mutations in <italic>mos4</italic> and other MAC components have previously been shown to affect the alternative splicing of both <italic>SNC1</italic> and <italic>RPS4</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and are associated with a suppression of <italic>SNC1</italic>-dependent immune signalling (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Palma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this study we demonstrated that there is an increased accumulation of the intron-retaining <italic>SNC1</italic> transcripts in <italic>mos4 snc1</italic> compared with <italic>snc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, this accumulation is radically enhanced in the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> triple mutant. One possible explanation for these results is that the <italic>mos4</italic> mutation and, to a lesser extent, the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutation individually disrupt splicing efficiency, reducing the pool of the functional full-length <italic>SNC1</italic> transcript variant with both introns excised but not increasing the production of alternative variants beyond the threshold required for immune activation. However, when these two mutations are combined in the <italic>snc1</italic> background, spliceosome activity is markedly disturbed and the accumulation of intron-retaining <italic>SNC1</italic> transcript variants is sufficiently high to yield enough truncated SNC1 to activate defence responses.</p><p content-type="indent">In addition to the splicing defects observed in <italic>nrpc7-1</italic>, the accumulations of rRNAs and tRNAs appear to be considerably distorted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, B). Ribosomal protein gene dosage was recently found to have an effect on embryonic stem cell differentiation in mice (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Fortier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), indicating that alterations in the abundance of ribosome components can dramatically alter developmental progression. Homozygous <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> plants exhibit certain phenotypes that may be associated with impaired stem cell differentiation including short roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>) and delayed emergence of the first true leaves. This suggests that the sensitivity of ribosome function to changes in its subunit levels, as well as its role in regulating stem cell differentiation, may be conserved in plants, although the data in support of this are preliminary and additional experiments are required to fully explore this hypothesis.</p><p content-type="indent">We also detected a reduction in the accumulation of the chloroplast 16S and 23S rRNAs relative to Pol I-transcribed 25S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A similar rRNA abundance pattern was recently reported for <italic>atybeY-1</italic>, a mutant allele of an endoribonuclease required for chloroplast rRNA processing and development that also exhibits pale green leaves and delayed development (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Although the mechanism by which alterations in a Pol III subunit result in changes to the transcriptional regulation of Pol I-transcribed genes and the chloroplast genome is unclear, the light green colour of the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) further suggests that this mutation may be associated with impaired chloroplast function.</p><p content-type="indent">The serrated leaf phenotype observed in <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> is likely linked to its elevated expression of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), which could be a result of reduced <italic>miR164</italic> activity in the mutant background or an indirect effect of the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutation on Pol II function. There may also be a link between the <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutant morphology and the decreased expression of the HD-ZIP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Other studies have demonstrated tentative links between the transcriptional activities of Pol II and Pol III. One study identified areas of the genome where protein-coding genes on one DNA strand overlapped with tRNA-coding genes on the opposite strand, and that their rates of transcription by Pol II and Pol III, respectively, were negatively correlated (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Lukoszek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Another study found that human <italic>RPPH1</italic> is transcribed by both Pol II and Pol III, and identified a number of transcriptional activators that associate with both Pols (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Faresse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Our data show that a disturbance in Pol III function affects the expression of non-Pol III-transcribed RNAs, indicating that the role of Arabidopsis Pol III in transcriptional regulation is more complex than previously assumed.</p><p content-type="indent">There are 12 core subunits of Arabidopsis Pol III, each of which has a homologue or is itself also a component in Pols I, II, IV, and V (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Haag and Pikaard, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Ream <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). There are also subunits specific to individual Pols. <italic>NRPC7</italic> encodes a core Pol III subunit with homologues in each of the other Pols, and shares significant sequence similarity with Rpc25 proteins from other model organisms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw020/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). However, Arabidopsis <italic>NRPC7</italic> failed to complement a temperature-sensitive <italic>rpc25</italic> yeast knockout line (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw020/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>), suggesting that the functional conservation of this protein by itself between yeast and plants is limited. This is not entirely unprecedented. Rpc25 is known to form a dimer with Rpc17 within the Pol III complex (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Siaut <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The protein&#x02013;protein interaction surface of NRPC7 may be sufficiently evolutionarily divergent so as to prohibit it from dimerizing with yeast Rpc17. Although the function of the protein complex is conserved, an individual component of the complex may still be divergent enough that it fails to complement a knockout of its orthologue in a distant organism.</p><p content-type="indent">In summary, we have demonstrated that a perturbation in Pol III function results in modified gene splicing as well as alterations in the abundances and potentially activities of a number of RNA molecules. These effects extend to several RNAs reported to be transcribed by other polymerases, revealing a novel role for Pol III in modulating the expression of a larger complement of genes than previously described. Moving forward, the partial loss-of-function <italic>nrpc7-1</italic> mutant provides a unique tool for performing other functional analyses of Pol III.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s20"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
