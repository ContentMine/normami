The Chl catabolic pathway has been intensively studied and nearly all the enzymes involved are identified and characterized; however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of this pathway are largely unknown. In this study, we performed yeast one-hybrid screening using a transcription factor cDNA library to search for factors controlling the expression of Chl catabolic genes. We identified ANAC046 as a common regulator that directly binds to the promoter regions of <italic>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</italic>, <italic>STAY-GREEN1</italic> (<italic>SGR1</italic>), <italic>SGR2</italic>, and <italic>PHEOPHORBIDE a OXYGENASE</italic>. Transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>ANAC046</italic> exhibited an early-senescence phenotype and a lower Chl content in comparison with the wild-type plants, whereas loss-of-function mutants exhibited a delayed-senescence phenotype and a higher Chl content. Microarray analysis of <italic>ANAC046</italic> transgenic plants showed that not only Chl catabolic genes but also senescence-associated genes were positively regulated by ANAC046. We conclude that ANAC046 is a positive regulator of Arabidopsis leaf senescence and exerts its effect by controlling the expression of Chl catabolic genes and senescence-associated genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Loss of green color, the most visually apparent phenomenon during leaf senescence, is caused by chlorophyll (Chl) degradation. This process facilitates redistribution of nutrients from senescent leaves to reproductive organs and increases reproductive success<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

To date, nearly all enzymes involved in Chl degradation have been identified and characterized. In higher plants, reduction of Chl <italic>b</italic> to Chl <italic>a</italic> is the initial step of Chl breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Chl <italic>b</italic> reductase, encoded by <italic>NON-YELLOW COLORING 1</italic> (<italic>NYC1</italic>) and <italic>NYC1-like</italic> (<italic>NOL</italic>), catalyzes the conversion of Chl <italic>b</italic> to 7-hydroxymethyl Chl <italic>a</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, which is then converted into Chl <italic>a</italic> by 7-hydroxymethyl-chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> reductase (HCAR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The central Mg atom of Chl <italic>a</italic> is removed by a metal-chelating substance (MCS), the molecular nature of which has not been identified, to form pheophytin <italic>a</italic>. Pheophytinase (PPH) then catalyzes the removal of the phytol tail of pheophytin <italic>a</italic> to form pheophorbide <italic>a</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Subsequently, the porphyrin macrocycle ring of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> is opened by pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> oxygenase (PaO) to produce red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. RCC is converted to nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (NCC) or nonfluorescent dioxobilin-type chlorophyll catabolite (NDCC), end-products of Chl breakdown, via <italic>primary</italic> fluorescent Chl catabolite (<italic>p</italic>FCC) by the actions of RCC reductase (RCCR), MES16, and CYP89A9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Chl breakdown also requires a protein termed STAY GREEN (SGR). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has three SGR homologs, SGR1, SGR2, and SGR-like<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. SGR1 and SGR-like positively regulate Chl degradation in senescing and pre-senescing leaves, respectively, whereas SGR2 negatively regulates Chl degradation in senescing leaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Many Chl catabolic genes, including <italic>NYC1</italic>, <italic>PPH</italic>, <italic>PaO</italic>, <italic>MES16</italic>, and <italic>SGR1</italic> are coordinately expressed and their transcript levels increase in senescing leaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Senescence is accompanied by transcriptional reprogramming of a large number of genes. In senescent leaves of Arabidopsis, more than 100 transcription factors (TFs) from various families, including NAC (no apical meristem [NAM], ATAF1/2, and cup-shaped cotyledon [CUC2]), WRKY, zinc finger proteins, and AP2/EREBP are upregulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In particular, plant-specific NAC superfamily constitutes a large portion of senescence-regulated genes in Arabidopsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Several NAC TFs, including AtNAP/ANAC029<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, ORESARA1/ANAC092<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, ORE1 SISTER1/ANAC059 (ORS1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and AtNAC016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, positively regulate leaf senescence. Their downstream target genes, including senescence-associated genes (SAGs), have been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Only limited information is available on whether the senescence-related NAC TFs are involved in the control of Chl catabolic gene expression. Recently, Qiu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> reported that ORE1 directly binds to the promoter regions of <italic>SGR1</italic>, <italic>NYC1</italic>, and <italic>PaO</italic>.</p><p>Towards an understanding the mechanism of Chl degradation, we performed comprehensive screening of TFs that bind to the promoter regions of Chl catabolic genes using an improved yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screening system with an Arabidopsis TF cDNA library<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Because the TF cDNA library is composed of 10% or less number of all Arabidopsis genes, the rate of false positives is much lower than in traditional screening. Another advantage of this approach is that we can directly employ the promoter region as bait. Here, we report identification of ANAC046, a previously uncharacterized member of the NAC superfamily, as a common regulator of the expression of <italic>NYC1</italic>, <italic>SGR1</italic>, <italic>SGR2</italic>, and <italic>PaO</italic>. ANAC046 belongs to the same subgroup as ORE1 and ORS1. Our analysis of mutant and transgenic <italic>ANAC046</italic> plants showed that ANAC046, ORE1, and ORS1 share common functions but also have distinct roles in leaf senescence.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of transcription factors that bind to the promoter regions of chlorophyll catabolic genes</title><p>To identify the TFs that directly control Chl degradation, we first constructed yeast strains carrying the <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter gene driven by the promoter regions of the following Chl catabolic genes: <italic>NYC1</italic>, <italic>NOL</italic>, <italic>HCAR</italic>, <italic>PPH</italic>, <italic>PaO</italic>, <italic>RCCR</italic>, <italic>CYP89A9</italic>, <italic>MES16</italic>, <italic>SGR1</italic>, and <italic>SGR2</italic>. Then, we examined binding of ca. 1300&#x02009;TFs (ca. 70% of all Arabidopsis TFs) to these regions. After the initial screening with 343 mini-pools, we performed a second screening and identified 93 interactions between the 10 promoters and 54 individual TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Among them, we were interested in the particular group of NAC TFs because three genes namely ANAC046, ANAC087, and ANAC100 were detected in experiments employing the promoters of <italic>NYC1</italic>, <italic>SGR1</italic>, <italic>SGR2</italic>, and <italic>PaO</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis clustered these three proteins into the same clade as ANAC079, ORE1, and ORS1 in the NAM subgroup of group I of the NAC superfamily (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. <italic>ANAC079</italic>, <italic>ANAC100</italic>, and <italic>ORE1</italic> have miR164-complementary sites with &#x02264;3 mismatches to miR164 and are likely to be target genes for this miRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the binding of six TFs to four promoters in a separate Y1H experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). ANAC046 bound to all the promoters tested. For ANAC087, the TF most similar to ANAC046 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>), the affinity to all of the promoters was low. ORE1 bound to the <italic>SGR2</italic> and <italic>PaO</italic> promoters, and ORS1 did not bind to any of the promoters tested. Therefore, we chose ANAC046 for further analysis.</p><p>To examine the interactions between ANAC046 and promoters of the 12 chlorophyll catabolic genes, we employed transient effector&#x02013;reporter analysis in leaf protoplasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, the VP16-fused form of ANAC046 clearly activated the reporter driven by the promoters of <italic>NYC1</italic>, <italic>SGR1</italic>, <italic>SGR2</italic>, and <italic>PaO</italic>, suggesting <italic>in planta</italic> binding of ANAC046 to these promoters. Thus, the results obtained in leaf protoplasts were consistent with those obtained in yeast. ANAC046 also activated <italic>MES16</italic> promoter <italic>in planta</italic> with less extent, although this activation was not observed in yeast.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phenotypic Analysis of <italic>ANAC046</italic> Transgenic Plants</title><p>To elucidate the function of ANAC046 in Chl degradation, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively overexpressing <italic>ANAC046</italic> (<italic>35S:ANAC046</italic>; OX) and plants expressing a chimeric repressor containing the SRDX domain at the C-terminus (<italic>35S:ANAC046-SRDX</italic>; SRDX). The SRDX plant is expected to show loss-of-function phenotype of <italic>ANAC046</italic> and its functionally redundant transcription factors as a result of dominant suppression of its target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We also obtained a putative knockout mutant, SM_3_27647 (KO), which has a transposon insertion in the <italic>ANAC046</italic> coding region.</p><p>The OX plants germinated on MS-agar slightly later than WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). At 40 days after sowing (DAS), the OX plants had wavy rosette leaves and were remarkably smaller than WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The KO and SRDX plants were slightly larger than WT plants during the course of development. The dry weight of aerial parts and roots was significantly lower in OX plants and that of roots was significantly higher in KO and SRDX plants than in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Chl content in the 8&#x02013;9th leaf at 40 DAS was slightly higher in the KO and SRDX plants and significantly lower in OX plants than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p>To compare the ultrastructure of chloroplasts, the leaves of WT, OX, KO, and SRDX plants at 40 DAS were analyzed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). At the end of the light period, chloroplast structure was similar in all plants tested: all mesophyll chloroplasts contained several large starch granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), which were produced by photosynthesis during the day. At the end of the dark period, only small starch granules were visible in the chloroplasts of the WT, KO, and SRDX plants, whereas chloroplasts of the OX plants still contained several large starch granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In line with these observations, iodine staining showed that the leaves of OX plants, but not those of the WT, KO, or SRDX plants, contained a high level of starch at the end of the dark period, whereas the starch level was high in the leaves of all plants at the end of the light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Involvement of ANAC046 in leaf senescence</title><p>To determine the involvement of ANAC046 in age-dependent senescence, we compared the plant phenotypes and Chl content in the leaves of OX, KO, SRDX, and WT plants at 35 and 70 DAS. Leaf yellowing was accelerated in the OX plants and delayed in the KO and SRDX plants in comparison with the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Leaf Chl content was significantly higher in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants at both 35 and 70 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). At 70 DAS, Chl content in the leaves of the OX plants was approximately half that of the WT plants. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was not significantly different among WT, OX, KO, and SRDX plants at 35 DAS, but was significantly higher in the KO and SRDX plants and slightly (but not significantly) lower in the OX plants than in the WT plants at 70 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Ion leakage rate (a senescence indicator) was similar in all plants until 56 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). At 70 DAS, it was significantly higher in the OX plants but significantly lower in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants.</p><p>The levels of photosynthetic proteins associated with PSI and PSII were assessed by western blotting with antibodies against the core proteins (PsaA and PsbA, respectively) and the antenna proteins of the light-harvesting complexes (Lhca1 and Lhcb1). The levels of the large subunit of Rubisco (RbcL), which is involved in carbon fixation, were also examined. At 35 DAS, we did not detect remarkable differences in the levels of the photosynthetic proteins among plants tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). At 70 DAS, much higher levels of all proteins were detected in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants, whereas all the proteins tested were below the detection limit in the OX plants.</p><p>We also analyzed the effect of ANAC046 on dark-induced senescence by transferring the plants at 35 DAS to continuous darkness. Leaves of the OX plants grown on MS-agar were pale green and somewhat smaller than WT plants at 35 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Chl content decreased faster in the OX plants, but slower in the KO and SRDX plants, than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The SRDX plants retained a high level of Chl even at 13 days after dark treatment (DAD). Ion leakage rate was significantly higher in the OX plants at 4 and 13 DAD and significantly lower in SRDX plants at 8 and 13 DAD than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The levels of all the photosynthetic proteins tested drastically decreased at 4 DAD in the OX plants but remained constant in the WT, KO, and SRDX plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). They were below the detection limit at 8 DAD in the OX plants. In contrast, the KO and SRDX plants contained substantial amounts of photosynthetic proteins even at 13 DAD, when these proteins became undetectable in WT plants.</p><p>To obtain a comprehensive view of transcriptomic changes in transgenic plants, we performed microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). We used RNAs from three independent lines of the OX and SRDX plants for the analysis. The level of <italic>ANAC046</italic> expression in these transgenic plants was more than 17-fold higher than that of WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). We also confirmed that <italic>ANAC046</italic> expression in the KO plants was extremely low. We found that SRDX and KO plants, which had similar phenotypes, also had similar transcriptomes (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.71; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). The expression of Chl catabolic genes, including <italic>NYC1</italic>, <italic>CLH1</italic>, <italic>PPH</italic>, <italic>PaO</italic>, <italic>SGR1</italic>, and <italic>SGR2</italic> was markedly higher in the OX plants and lower in the KO and SRDX plants than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Likewise, the expression of marker genes for leaf senescence, including <italic>SAG12</italic> and <italic>SAG13</italic>, was also higher in the OX plants and lower in the KO and SRDX plants than in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). We also examined age-dependent changes in the expression of genes upregulated in each of the three transgenic lines by using publicly available microarray data of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The expression of most genes upregulated in the OX plants increased with age, whereas the expression of most genes upregulated in the KO and SRDX plants decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). These data clearly support accelerated senescence of OX plants and delayed senescence of KO and SRDX plants.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Chl degradation pathway consists of six chloroplast-located enzymes, two cytoplasm-located enzymes, a metal-chelating substance, and the key regulator SGR, and produces nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

However, there may be no or only limited functional redundancy between ORE1 and ANAC046 in terms of age-dependent senescence because distinct delayed senescence phenotypes were observed in an single mutant of <italic>ORE1</italic> and that of <italic>ANAC046</italic>.

At least the former NAC TFs could be downstream regulators of ANAC046 or co-regulated TFs with ANAC046. On the other hand, the latter NAC TFs could be upstream of ANAC046 or independent from ANAC046. The complicated NAC-NAC regulatory circuit is unique aspect of plants and remains to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>In Arabidopsis, single mutants of <italic>NYC1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <italic>SGR1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <italic>PPH</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and <italic>PaO</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> exhibit stay-green phenotypes with decreased levels of photosynthetic activity (termed &#x0201c;nonfunctional stay-green&#x0201d;). In contrast, KO and SRDX plants retained both Chl and photosynthetic proteins longer than the WT plants did during both age-dependent and dark-induced senescence. As judged by the CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, the decline in photosynthetic activity in the old leaves was much slower in KO and SRDX plants than in WT plants. We therefore consider the KO and SRDX plants to have functional stay-green phenotypes. Because a decline in photosynthetic activity is a typical symptom of leaf senescence, the results demonstrate that, besides regulating Chl degradation, ANAC046 plays important roles in other physiological events during leaf senescence, including regulation of photosynthetic activity.</p><p>Overexpression of <italic>ANAC046</italic> severely impaired plant growth and enhanced leaf yellowing. These phenotypes were not observed in plants overexpressing <italic>ORE1</italic> and <italic>ORS1</italic>, again showing the functional difference between ORE1 and ANAC046<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Furthermore, mesophyll chloroplasts of the OX plants at 40 DAS contained large starch granules at the end of the dark period, whereas the WT plants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that the OX plants cannot degrade as much starch during the dark period as WT plants can, which may reduce carbon supply and therefore plant size becomes small. It is noteworthy that the phenotypes of loss-of-function mutants defective in starch metabolism such as <italic>maltose excess 1</italic> (<italic>mex1</italic>: maltose transporter) and <italic>disproportionating enzyme 1</italic> (<italic>dpe1</italic>: debranching enzyme)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> are similar to that of <italic>ANAC046</italic> OX plants. However, there was no significant difference in the expression levels of <italic>MEX1</italic> and <italic>DPE1</italic> between the OX and WT plants in our microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>). Accumulation of starch generally occurs in old leaves, although the molecular mechanism of this selectivity remains unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that starch accumulation is a senescence syndrome that occurs earlier in the OX plants than in the WT plants.</p><p>Plant hormones positively or negatively regulate leaf senescence by integrating developmental and environmental cues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. It is widely acknowledged that ABA, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene are positive regulators of leaf senescence, whereas cytokinins, gibberellins, and auxins are negative regulators. The signaling pathways of these plant hormones communicate with each other and cooperatively or antagonistically regulate senescence. To elucidate the role of each plant hormone in senescence, much effort has been made to analyze mutants defective in the signaling pathway of each hormone. Buchanan-Wollaston <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> have identified a set of senescence-related genes downregulated in the SA signaling&#x02013;defective mutant <italic>NahG</italic>; many of them are upregulated during age-dependent senescence but are unaffected by dark treatment. We examined the microarray data of <italic>ANAC046</italic> mutants to see whether the expression of SA-dependent and developmentally regulated genes is affected by ANAC046). However, expression of these genes were only slightly affected in the OX and KO plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9</xref>). In contrast, nearly all senescence-related genes downregulated in both the JA signaling&#x02013;defective mutant <italic>coi1</italic> and ethylene signaling&#x02013;defective mutant <italic>ein2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> were upregulated in the OX plants and downregulated in the KO and SRDX plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S10</xref>). Most genes dependent on the JA pathway, ethylene pathway, or both are also upregulated during dark-induced senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. These results suggest that ANAC046 plays a role in controlling developmental and dark-induced senescence downstream of JA and ethylene signaling pathways.</p><p>Recently, several TFs involved in hormonal signaling pathway have been identified as positive regulators of Chl catabolic gene expression. ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) and ENHANCED EM LEVEL (EEL) directly bind to the promoters of <italic>SGR1</italic>, <italic>SGR2</italic>, and <italic>NYC1</italic> in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.

However, these TFs involved in ABA- and JA-signaling did not bind to the promoters of either <italic>SGR1</italic> or <italic>NYC1</italic> in our Y1H screening. We found that several TFs (in addition to ANAC046, ANAC087, and ANAC100) bind to the promoters of <italic>SGR1</italic>, <italic>SGR2</italic>, <italic>NYC1</italic>, and <italic>PaO</italic>, although the precise functions of these TFs remain to be elucidated. It is possible that the Chl catabolic pathway is finely tuned by multiple TFs involved in various aspects of plant growth and development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our comprehensive Y1H screening for TFs that directly target Chl catabolic genes identified a previously uncharacterized TF, ANAC046. We showed that ANAC046 stimulates the expression not only of Chl catabolic genes but also of senescence-related genes. We also identified several TFs that directly bind the promoters of Chl catabolic genes. We assume that Chl degradation and leaf senescence are controlled by multiple TFs, which may function redundantly. Further study is needed to unravel the integration of these TFs into the molecular network that controls Chl degradation and leaf senescence.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia-0 was used throughout this study.
