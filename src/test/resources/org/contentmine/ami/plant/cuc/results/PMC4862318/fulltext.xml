In this study, we carried out functional analysis of two candidate stress-responsive HD-ZIP I class homeobox genes from rice, <italic>OsHOX22</italic>, and <italic>OsHOX24</italic>. These genes were highly up-regulated under various abiotic stress conditions at different stages of rice development, including seedling, mature and reproductive stages. The transcript levels of these genes were enhanced significantly in the presence of plant hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid. The recombinant full-length and truncated homeobox proteins were found to be localized in the nucleus. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay established the binding of these homeobox proteins with specific DNA sequences, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG) and AH2 (CAAT(C/G)ATTG). Transactivation assays in yeast revealed the transcriptional activation potential of full-length OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 proteins. Homo- and hetero-dimerization capabilities of these proteins have also been demonstrated. Further, we identified putative novel interacting proteins of OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 via yeast-two hybrid analysis. Over-expression of <italic>OsHOX24</italic> imparted higher sensitivity to stress hormone, ABA, and abiotic stresses in the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants as revealed by various physiological and phenotypic assays. Microarray analysis revealed differential expression of several stress-responsive genes in transgenic lines as compared to wild-type. Many of these genes were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation and various metabolic pathways. Altogether, our results suggest the possible role of OsHOX22/OsHOX24 homeobox proteins as negative regulators in abiotic stress responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>homeobox transcription factors</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>DNA binding</kwd><kwd>protein&#x02013;protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001412</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">F.

These environmental factors, either singularly or compositely, cause several adverse effects on the productivity of crop plants like rice. However, by adopting biotechnological tools, it is now possible to generate high-yielding stress-tolerant plants. Several TFs have been used as potent tools to engineer abiotic stress tolerance in plants (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2011</xref>). The over-expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-responsive TFs, like dehydration-responsive element binding proteins (DREBs), ABA-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs), no apical meristem (NAM), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> activation factor 1/2 (ATAF1/2), cup-shaped cotyledon 2 (CUC2) proteins (NACs), has led to the generation of stress-tolerant transgenic plants without loss in crop yield (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Todaka et al., 2015</xref>). However, the function of various other TFs in abiotic stress tolerance still remains to be explored.</p><p>Homeobox TFs belong to a large gene family and are known to play crucial roles in various aspects of plant development (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gehring et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nam and Nei, 2005</xref>). Rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genomes contain at least 110 homeobox genes each (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>). The members of homeobox TF family have been categorized into 14 classes, including HD-ZIP and TALE superclasses (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>). The plant-specific HD-ZIP superclass contains highest number of homeobox proteins (48) and is grouped into four subfamilies, HD-ZIP I-IV (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>). All HD-ZIP superclass proteins possess HD and leucine-zipper (LZ) domains. Besides this, HD-ZIP II proteins contain ZIBEL and CE motifs, whereas HD-ZIP III proteins contain MEKHLA domain also. In addition, both HD-ZIP III and HD-ZIP IV subfamily proteins harbor START and HD-SAD domains (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Various HD-ZIP superclass members are known to regulate a variety of developmental processes and abiotic stress responses in plants (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ariel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2011</xref>). The ectopic expression of a HD-ZIP I subfamily member indicated its involvement in leaf development and blue light signaling (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), and few members were reported to mediate giberrellin signaling (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Son et al., 2010</xref>). HD-ZIP II subfamily members have been implicated in shade avoidance responses in plants (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sessa et al., 2005</xref>). HD-ZIP III subfamily members have emerged as vital regulators of apical meristem formation, maintenance of abaxial or adaxial polarity of leaves and embryo, besides vascular development and leaf initiation process in shoot apical meristem region in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, respectively (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Prigge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 2008</xref>). Further, HD-ZIP IV subfamily members were reported to be crucial determinants of outer cell layer formation of plant organs, leaf rolling process, trichome development and anther cell wall differentiation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Vernoud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). It has been speculated that evolutionary pressure resulted in well orchestrated participation of numerous HD-ZIP subfamily members in developmental regulation of plants (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ariel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A number of HD-ZIP superclass members have been found to be differentially expressed during abiotic stress conditions in different plant species (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gago et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharjee et al., 2015</xref>). The involvement of some HD-ZIP I subfamily members have already been reported in modulating abiotic stress responses (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2012</xref>). In recent times, <italic>AtHB12</italic> and <italic>AtHB7</italic> were found to mediate both growth related processes and water stress responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000e9; et al., 2014</xref>). Some studies have demonstrated the role of a few HD-ZIP genes of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice in abiotic stress tolerance as well (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and they may act as promising candidates for crop improvement (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharjee and Jain, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previously, at least nine of the 14 members of HD-ZIP I family in rice were found to be differentially expressed under abiotic stress conditions (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, we performed comprehensive expression profiling of two candidate HD-ZIP I family homeobox genes, <italic>OsHOX22</italic> (<italic>LOC_Os04g45810</italic>) and <italic>OsHOX24</italic> (<italic>LOC_Os02g43330</italic>), under various abiotic stress conditions at different stages of development in rice. We established the nuclear localization of OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 proteins, analyzed their transactivation and dimerization properties, and identified their novel interacting proteins. Further, we studied the binding property of purified proteins with specific DNA sequences and identified their putative downstream targets at whole genome-level. In addition, we over-expressed <italic>OsHOX24</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and showed its role in abiotic stress responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Growth Conditions, Stress, and Hormone Treatments</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Col-0) seeds procured from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Research Centre (ABRC) were grown in pots containing autoclaved mixture of agropeat and vermiculite (1:1) [supplemented with nutrient medium (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Somerville and Ogren, 1982</xref>)] or on MS plates as described previously (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Laxmi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Maloney et al., 2015</xref>).

Relatively higher concentrations of different hormones were used, since treatments were given to whole rice seedlings hydroponically for short duration (3 h) to study differential gene expression.</p><p>For imparting abiotic stresses, 7-day-old rice seedlings were removed from trays and subjected to desiccation (whole seedlings were kept between folds of tissue paper and allowed to dry), salinity (seedling roots were submerged in 200 mM NaCl solution), cold [seedling roots were submerged in reverse-osmosis (RO) water and kept at 4 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C in cold room] and osmotic stress (seedling roots were submerged in 200 mM mannitol solution) treatments as described earlier (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>). Whole seedlings under control and stress conditions were harvested after 1, 3, 6, and 12 h time points and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Likewise, greenhouse grown 5-week-old mature rice plants were subjected to desiccation and salinity stress treatments for 1, 3, 6, and 12 h followed by tissue harvesting. Seedlings kept in RO water and plants grown in pots (filled with soil) supplied with RO water served as experimental control. Four-month-old reproductive-stage rice plants were subjected to desiccation (by withholding water) and salinity (200 mM NaCl solution) stresses, and flag-leaf and panicle tissues were harvested after 6 and 12 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis</title><p>To study the gene expression, quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out as described earlier (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>).

In this study, we also demonstrated the binding specificity of OsHOX24 and OsHOX22 proteins with AH1 and AH2 motifs. These observations imply that the binding specificities of homeobox proteins are conserved in different plants.</p><p>One of the possible modes of action of homeobox TFs in abiotic stress response may be via regulation of downstream target genes. However, limited information is available about their downstream target genes. A dehydrin gene, <italic>CdeT6-19</italic>, has been identified as potential target of <italic>CpHB-7</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2006</xref>). The genes involved in ethylene synthesis and signaling were found to be downstream targets of Hahb-4 (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Manavella et al., 2006</xref>). A genome-wide scan identified at least 809 rice genes harboring AH1 and/or AH2 motifs in their promoter regions which might represent their putative downstream target genes. Many of these genes are involved in crucial biological and developmental processes. These results suggest that OsHOX24/OsHOX22 TFs may regulate the expression of downstream target genes involved in diverse biological processes to mediate abiotic stress responses.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the transactivation property in TFs, due to the presence of intrinsic activation domain (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Particularly, carboxy-terminal region of AtHB1 was identified to be responsible for transcriptional activation property in yeast (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Arce et al., 2011</xref>). Among rice HD-ZIP TFs, OsHOX1 and OsHOX3 exhibited transcriptional repression activity, whereas OsHOX4 and OsHOX5 were recognized as transcriptional activators (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Meijer et al., 2000</xref>). We noted the presence of an activation domain in the C-terminal region of OsHOX24/OsHOX22 proteins, which imparted transactivating nature to these proteins. We found OsHOX24/OsHOX22 proteins to be localized in the nucleus, consistent with the presence of a NLS in their amino acid sequence and with earlier reports for other homeobox TFs to be nuclear-localized (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether, these evidences suggest that OsHOX24/OsHOX22 are nuclear-localized and can function as transcriptional activators.</p><p>The current knowledge about interacting proteins of homeobox TFs is limiting. We identified several proteins, including enzymes, receptor protein, expressed proteins, and a TF as putative interacting proteins of OsHOX24 and OsHOX22. Many of these putative interacting proteins were found to be abiotic stress-responsive. There are several instances, where interaction between two TFs has been found to crucially mediate abiotic stress responses in plants (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). We identified GRAM domain TF as putative interacting protein of OsHOX24. Interestingly, lower transcript levels of GRAM domain TF-gene was detected in ABA-sensitive <italic>Osabf1</italic> rice mutants (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Amir Hossain et al., 2010</xref>). It is well established that sucrose metabolism is severely affected by environmental alterations, which leads to strong impact on plant development (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Koch, 2004</xref>). Many genes including members of sucrose synthase family and a UDP-glucosyltransferase gene have been implicated in abiotic stress responses in plants (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gupta and Kaur, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Tognetti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Very recently, OsPAL4 (phenylalanine ammonia lyase) has been implicated in broad spectrum disease resistance (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Tonnessen et al., 2015</xref>). In our investigation, sucrose synthase (SUS4) and phenylalanine lyase were identified as the interacting partners of OsHOX24, whereas UDP-glucuronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase domain containing protein was found to be interacting partner of OsHOX22 in yeast. A translation initiation factor has been reported to elicit abiotic stress tolerance in yeast and plants (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Rausell et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we too found eukaryotic translation initiation factor I to be an interactor of OsHOX24. This interaction may be crucial for regulation of translation initiation under abiotic stress conditions. Recently, a universal stress protein was found to accentuate drought tolerance in tomato (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Loukehaich et al., 2012</xref>). We also identified an universal stress protein domain containing protein as one of the interacting proteins of OsHOX22. These observations indicated that homeobox TFs interact with other proteins to modulate abiotic stress responses.</p><p>The analysis of few mutant and transgenic lines of homeobox TFs has revealed their role in abiotic stress responses in plants (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, the overlapping and explicit roles of <italic>ATHB7</italic> and <italic>ATHB12</italic> in modulating various aspects of plant development and responses to water-deficit stress have been delineated (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000e9; et al., 2014</xref>). In a previous study, rice BELL-type homeobox TF, <italic>OsB1HD1</italic>, has been reported to act as a negative regulator by suppressing the abiotic stress signaling cascade in over-expression tobacco transgenic lines (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). The role of <italic>OsHOX22</italic> has been deciphered in ABA-dependent abiotic stress responses, which was also found to act as negative regulator of drought and salt tolerance in rice (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). We over-expressed <italic>OsHOX24</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to substantiate its role in abiotic stress responses, and analyzed drought and salinity stress responses of WT and transgenic plants at various developmental stages. These studies revealed higher susceptibility of transgenics as compared to WT under abiotic stress conditions. Several reports have implicated plant hormone ABA in abiotic stress responses (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cutler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>). We observed enhanced sensitivity of <italic>OsHOX24 Arabidopsis</italic> transgenics under exogenous ABA treatment. Previous investigations have also demonstrated the ABA-inducible nature of HD-ZIP I family members in model plants and established their role in ABA signaling (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Vald&#x000e9;s et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, our results in conjunction with available reports suggest that <italic>OsHOX24</italic> and <italic>OsHOX22</italic> may act in an ABA-dependent abiotic stress response pathway.</p><p>Several genes were found to be differentially expressed in <italic>OsHOX24 Arabidopsis</italic> transgenics, which were related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, electron carriers and IAA biosynthesis, and amino acid and fatty acid degradation pathways. The role of secondary metabolites, amino acids, fatty acids, and electron carriers are well known in plant stress adaptation (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Ramakrishna and Ravishankar, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">El-kereamy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anjum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor, 2015</xref>). Besides this, the crucial role of IAA in abiotic stress responses has also been proposed (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jain and Khurana, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Down-regulation of genes involved in biosynthesis of osmoprotectants or secondary metabolites, coupled with elevated transcript levels of genes involved in fatty acid degradation may be responsible for greater susceptibility of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenics to abiotic stresses. Several stress-responsive genes are known to be induced under various abiotic stress conditions in plants (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Walley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Pitzschke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). The down-regulation of these genes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenics can explain their higher susceptibility to various abiotic stresses to some extent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>OsHOX24</italic> and <italic>OsHOX22</italic> were found to be differentially expressed under various abiotic stress conditions at different stages of rice development. We demonstrated that these nuclear-localized homeobox TFs possess transactivation and dimerization properties. We also identified novel interacting proteins of homeobox TFs and many of them are stress-responsive. We showed the binding ability of OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 with specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and identified several putative downstream targets. The over-expression of <italic>OsHOX24</italic> imparted higher susceptibility to various abiotic stresses in the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants as revealed by several physiological and molecular assays. Overall, our results highlight the role of OsHOX24 and OsHOX22 TFs in abiotic stress responses. In future, the generation and analysis of knock-out transgenic lines would be able to provide more insights about the role of these homeobox TFs in abiotic stress tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MJ conceived and supervised the whole study.
