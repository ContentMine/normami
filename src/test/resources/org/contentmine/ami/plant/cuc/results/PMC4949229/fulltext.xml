However, the exact function of NAC072 in ABA signaling is still elusive. In this study, we present evidence for the interrelation between NAC072 and ABA-responsive element binding factor 3 (ABF3) that act as a positive regulator of ABA-responsive gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The transcript of <italic>NAC072</italic> is up-regulated by ABF3 in ABA response, and NAC072 protein interacts with ABF3. Enhanced ABA sensitivity occurs in <italic>nac072</italic> mutant plants that overexpressed <italic>ABF3</italic>. However, overexpression of <italic>NAC072</italic> weakened the ABA sensitivity in the <italic>abf3</italic> mutant plants, but instead of recovering the ABA sensitivity of <italic>abf3</italic>. NAC072 and ABF3 cooperate to regulate <italic>RD29A</italic> expression, but are antagonistic when regulating <italic>RD29B</italic> expression. Therefore, NAC072 displays a dual function in ABF3-mediated ABA-responsive gene regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dual function</kwd><kwd>NAC072</kwd><kwd>ABF3</kwd><kwd>abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>RD29A</kwd><kwd>RD29B</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31501167, 31471422, 31301055</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">The Science and Technology Project of GuangDong province</funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">2015A030310457, S2012010009516</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important signaling molecule that enables plants to tolerate unfavorable environmental stresses such as drought, salt, cold, heat, and oxidation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hauser et al., 2011</xref>). Core components that consist of ABA signaling have been identified, including ABA receptors PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE (PYR/PYL; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2009</xref>), PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C (PP2C; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2009</xref>), SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2 (SnRK2; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al., 2009</xref>), downstream transcription factors (TFs) such as ABA INSENSITIVE 3/4/5 (ABI3/4/5), ion channels, and NADPH oxidases (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Mustilli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Schweighofer et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF/AREB) members (ABF1, AREB1/ABF2, AREB2/ABF4, and ABF3) can bind the ABA-responsive element (ABRE) and function in ABA-dependent signaling pathway (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2010</xref>). Principally, <italic>ABF1</italic> is in response to cold; overexpression of <italic>ABF2</italic> confers tolerance to drought, salt, heat, and oxidative stress; <italic>ABF4</italic> is mainly induced by drought, salt, and cold; and overexpression of <italic>ABF3</italic> confers tolerance to drought, salt, cold, heat, and oxidative stresses. ABF3 has largely overlapping functions with other ABF/AREB members and ABI5, and mainly acts in ABA-mediated response during seedling development (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdeen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) TFs contain a plant-specific highly conserved N-terminal domain and play various roles in plant development, senescence and the response to environmental stress (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2004</xref>). The molecular function of NAC TFs in abiotic stress-responses has been examined in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. For example, ORESARA1 (ORE1/AtNAC2) positively regulates the salt stress response (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Balazadeh et al., 2010</xref>); JUNGBRUNNEN1 (JUB1/NAC042) directly regulates dehydration responsive element binding protein 2A (DREB2A) and acts as a negative regulator of the salt stress response (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shahnejat-Bushehri et al., 2012</xref>); NAC016 promotes drought stress responses by repressing AREB1/ABF2 transcription (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Sakuraba et al., 2015</xref>); and NAC096 directly interacts with ABF2 and ABF4 (but not with ABF3) to assist plant survival during dehydration and osmotic stress (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that NAC family members may serve as mediators through crosstalk with other stress regulators, such as the stress-responsive TFs.</p><p>NAC072/RD26, NAC019, and NAC055/AtNAC3 belong to the same clade of NAC domain genes and may have overlapping functions in the drought response (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Hickman et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of these NAC TFs in plants enhances drought tolerance, indicating that they may act as positive regulators of the drought stress response (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2004</xref>). Meanwhile, NAC019 and NAC055 are involved in jasmonic acid and/or ethylene signaling pathways, whereas NAC072 has been reported to be associated with the ABA-dependent stress response and to be strongly induced by ABA (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2004</xref>). Double and triple mutants of these three homologous NAC genes have been obtained by crossing the single mutants with each other, and subsequent ABA response and downstream gene expression were analyzed with or without exogenous ABA treatments. Following exogenous ABA treatment, there was no significant difference in germination rate or root growth between the single mutants and the double mutants, although they were more ABA insensitive than the wild type (WT). The triple mutant of <italic>nac019nac055nac072</italic> was only slightly more sensitive to ABA or dehydration than the single mutants of <italic>nac019, nac055</italic>, and <italic>nac072</italic> or the double mutants of <italic>nac019nac055, nac055nac072</italic>, and <italic>nac019nac072</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). However, <italic>NAC072</italic> plays a dominant role in the development of green cotyledons, and <italic>NAC055</italic> coordinates with <italic>NAC072</italic> during this process to regulate the expression of ABA-responsive downstream genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). These findings indicate that NAC072, NAC019, and NAC055 may act individually in different stress responses, and that NAC072 is mainly responsible for ABA response.</p><p>Several TFs or downstream genes targeted by NAC family members have been identified. As previously mentioned, NAC016 directly represses the expression of <italic>AREB1</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Sakuraba et al., 2015</xref>), and NAC096 binds ABF2/AREB1 and ABF4 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the NAC family are closely involved with ABF/AREB TFs during senescence or stress responses. Promoter fragments of the <italic>NAC072, NAC019</italic>, and <italic>NAC055</italic> genes contain ABRE motifs, and was bound either ABF3 or ABF4 according to yeast one-hybrid assays (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Hickman et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that ABF/ABRE TFs may also regulate these NAC TFs. NAC072/RD26 has been reported to be involved in the ABA-mediated regulation of drought-responsive genes; however, the specific genetic effect of <italic>NAC072</italic> in the ABA signaling pathway is still unknown. Whether physical interactions occur between NAC072 and ABF/AREB TFs or other ABA-responsive signaling components, and subsequently involve in ABA response, remains unresolved.</p><p>Here, we show that the <italic>NAC072</italic> gene is upregulated by overexpression of ABF3. Loss of <italic>NAC072</italic> function results in ABA insensitivity, while loss of both <italic>NAC072</italic> and <italic>ABF3</italic> function further improve ABA insensitivity. Overexpression of <italic>NAC072</italic> enhances ABA sensitivity in WT plants, but does not recover the ABA sensitivity of the <italic>abf3</italic> mutant. This suggests that <italic>NAC072</italic> is positively involved in the ABA response and is dependent on ABF3. On the other hand, <italic>nac072</italic> mutants with overexpressed <italic>ABF3</italic> display greater ABA sensitivity than WT plants with overexpressed <italic>ABF3</italic>, indicating that <italic>NAC072</italic> is negatively involved in the ABF3-mediated ABA response. Furthermore, <italic>NAC072</italic> is regulated by ABF3, and NAC072 interacted with ABF3. In response to ABA, NAC072 cooperates with ABF3 to regulate <italic>RD29A</italic> expression, but acts antagonistically to ABF3 in the mediation of <italic>RD29B</italic> regulation. In summary, NAC072 displays a dual function in ABF3-mediated ABA signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and ABA Application</title><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds for <italic>abf3</italic> (SALK_17755), <italic>nac072</italic> (SALK_083756), <italic>nac055</italic> (SALK_014331), and <italic>nac019</italic> (SALK_096295) were obtained from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center (ABRC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>).

This indicates that NAC072 is a positive regulator for ABA signaling. To examine the relationship between NAC072 and ABF3, the expression of <italic>NAC072</italic> was first analyzed in the loss-of-function mutant of <italic>ABF3</italic> (<italic>abf3</italic>). The <italic>NAC072</italic> expression was dramatically reduced in <italic>abf3</italic> after ABA treatment, whereas the transcript level of <italic>ABF3</italic> was not affected in the <italic>NAC072</italic> deficient mutant <italic>nac072</italic> (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). It suggests that the expression of <italic>NAC072</italic> is mediated by ABF3 under ABA treatment. Meanwhile, <italic>RD29A</italic> and <italic>RD29B</italic> are rapidly induced by drought stress or ABA, and are thus considered to be stress-response marker genes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Msanne et al., 2011</xref>). Both <italic>RD29A</italic> and <italic>RD29B</italic> were highly upregulated by ABA treatment, while their expressions were dramatically reduced in <italic>abf3nac072</italic> mutants, although different expression patterns were observed in the single mutants. <italic>RD29A</italic> was repressed in <italic>abf3</italic> and <italic>nac072</italic> after ABA treatment; although <italic>RD29B</italic> was attenuated in <italic>abf3</italic> mutants, it increased notably in <italic>nac072</italic> after ABA treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). These suggest that NAC072 may cooperate with ABF3 in the regulation of <italic>RD29A</italic> gene expression, while acting antagonistically with ABF3 in the regulation of <italic>RD29B</italic> gene expression. Thus, NAC072 seems to play a dual role in ABA-inducible gene expression in combination with ABF3.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>The synergistic function of NAC072 in ABF3-mediated ABA response.

Thus, ABA sensitivities of these plants were examined during the development of green cotyledon and axial root growth. Overexpression of <italic>NAC072</italic> or <italic>ABF3</italic> (in the <italic>NAC072-OX</italic> or <italic>ABF3-OX</italic> plants) resulted in slight growth inhibition and enhanced ABA sensitivity (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref></bold>; Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). However, overexpression of <italic>NAC072</italic> in <italic>abf3</italic> (<italic>NAC072-OX/abf3</italic>) resulted in less ABA sensitivity than in <italic>NAC072-OX</italic> or WT plants, and <italic>NAC072-OX/abf3</italic> had less ABA sensitivity than <italic>abf3</italic> (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref></bold>; Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S7</xref>). This suggests that NAC072 is partly dependent on ABF3 for the positive regulation in ABA response, and NAC072 had a negative role on ABA response. Furthermore, the <italic>ABF3-OX/nac072</italic> plants (where ABF3 was overexpressed in the <italic>nac072</italic>) showed further improved ABA sensitivity compared with <italic>ABF3-OX</italic> or WT plants (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C&#x02013;G</xref></bold>; Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S7</xref>).

In addition, overexpression of ABF3 in <italic>nac019nac072, nac055nac072</italic>, or <italic>nac055nac072nac019</italic> resulted in the same degree of ABA sensitivity as the <italic>ABF3-OX/nac072</italic> plants, but they displayed higher ABA sensitivity than <italic>ABF3-OX</italic> plants (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>).

These results further indicate that NAC072 acts antagonistically with ABF3 in regulating the expression of <italic>RD29B</italic>. Taken together, NAC072 may function as a cofactor, which not only cooperates with but also antagonizes ABF3-mediated regulation of the ABA response.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In our previous work, we obtained double and triple mutants of three <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAC homologous genes (<italic>NAC019, NAC055</italic>, and <italic>NAC072</italic>). ABA sensitivity analysis indicated that NAC055 plays an important role during germination process, while NAC072 partly inhibited the expression of <italic>RD29B</italic> and <italic>RAB18</italic>, both of which are widely described as ABA signaling marker genes as their expressions are always induced by dehydration or ABA (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). However, NAC072 is reportedly involved in the ABA-dependent stress-signaling pathway and functions as a transcriptional activator in ABA-inducible gene expression (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2004</xref>). These contradictory results prompted us to further explore the role of NAC072 in ABA signaling.</p><p>ABF3 is the key downstream regulator of ABA signaling and is important for ABA-mediated main root growth. Reprogramming the drought response by changing the timing or strength of expression of some drought-responsive genes was observed in plants with overexpressed <italic>ABF3</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein et al., 2005</xref>). ABA sensitivity in the <italic>abf3</italic> mutant was lower than that in the <italic>abf2, abf4</italic> mutants or WT during the development of cotyledon or main root growth (data not shown). Therefore, the ABF3-mediated ABA signaling pathway was chosen to illuminate the role of NAC072 in the ABA response. Subsequently, we uncovered four key points as follows: (1) the transcription level of <italic>NAC072</italic> is partly regulated by ABF3; (2) NAC072 interacts and cooperates with ABF3 to regulate gene expression (including that of <italic>RD29A</italic>) in the ABA response; (3) NAC072 partly depends on ABF3 for its role in the ABA response during the development of cotyledon and main root growth; (4) NAC072 antagonizes the action of ABF3 to some extent in the regulation of <italic>RD29B</italic> expression.</p><p>Transcriptome data from plants overexpressing ABF3 show that the expression of <italic>NAC072/RD26</italic> as well as <italic>NAC019</italic> and <italic>NAC055/AtNAC3</italic> is independent of ABF3 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdeen et al., 2010</xref>). In accordance with these results, we detected NAC072 expression in both <italic>ABF3</italic>-overexpressing plants and <italic>abf3</italic> mutants. However, either under control conditions or after ABA treatment, overexpression of <italic>ABF3</italic> increased the expression of <italic>NAC072</italic> (data not shown). Loss of ABF3 function reduced <italic>NAC072</italic> transcript levels, but the expression of <italic>NAC072</italic> could still be detected after ABA treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). Hence, the expression of <italic>NAC072</italic> seems partly dependent on ABF3.</p><p>ABF3, AREB2, and AREB1 can form homo- or heterodimers and have redundant function (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2010</xref>). Some NAC proteins have been observed to interact with the AREB family. Typically, ANAC096 directly interacts with ABF2/AREB1 and AREB2/ABF4, and NAC016 interacts with ABF2/AREB1 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Sakuraba et al., 2015</xref>). The relationship between NACs and ABF3 is still unclear, but our yeast two-hybrid results show that the C- or N-terminal regions of NAC072 interact with ABF3 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>). It seems likely, then, that the contradictory roles of NAC072 in ABA signaling might be resolved by an understanding of its relationship with ABF3. We assumed that NAC072 functions as a cofactor with ABF3 in the ABA signaling pathway. Accordingly, ABA sensitivity and ABA-inducible genes were analyzed in <italic>abf3, nac072</italic>, and <italic>abf3nac072</italic> mutants (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). The results indicate that NAC072 cooperates with ABF3 in mediation of <italic>RD29A</italic> expression, but antagonizes <italic>RD29B</italic> expression. It is well known that both <italic>RD29A</italic> and <italic>RD29B</italic> rapidly respond to various stresses and ABA treatment (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Narusaka et al., 2003</xref>). In the present study, <italic>RD29B</italic> was directly and positively regulated by ABF3, while NAC072 may act as a repressor during this process. To further confirm this, <italic>NAC072</italic> was overexpressed in WT and <italic>abf3</italic> mutant plants. The expression of <italic>RD29B</italic> was enhanced in <italic>NAC072-OX/WT</italic> and <italic>NAC072-OX/abf3</italic> plants under control conditions, but no change in expression occurred after ABA treatment. In contrast, overexpressed <italic>ABF3</italic> rapidly increased <italic>RD29B</italic> transcription levels in control as well as ABA-treated plants. The combined loss of NAC072 function and ABF3 overexpression contributed to enhanced <italic>RD29B</italic> expression. Moreover, <italic>NAC072-OX/abf3</italic> plants were more ABA insensitive than WT or <italic>NAC072-OX/WT</italic> plants, whereas <italic>ABF3-OX/nac072</italic> was more ABA sensitive than <italic>WT</italic> or <italic>ABF3-OX/WT</italic> plants. In addition, NAC072 collaborates with ABF3 to regulate <italic>RD29A</italic> expression. Thus, we hypothesize that NAC072 and ABF3 may act as a &#x0201c;push-pull&#x0201d; device. Under certain conditions, NAC072 cooperates with ABF3-mediated gene expression, thus providing a &#x0201c;push&#x0201d; stimulus, while under other conditions it acts antagonistically to ABF3, giving a &#x0201c;pull&#x0201d; effect. How the device works would depend on specific conditions, a detailed understanding of which requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XyL, XuL, and LL designed the research.
