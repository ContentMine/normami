Rapidly growing primordia are distinguished from the meristem and each other by slower growing boundaries. PETAL LOSS (PTL) is a trihelix transcription factor of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that represses growth in boundaries between newly arising sepals. To identify partners involved in this growth limitation, a young inflorescence cDNA library was screened by yeast two-hybrid technology with PTL as bait. The most frequent prey identified was AKIN10, the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunit of the Snf1-related kinase1 (SnRK1). Interaction was mapped to the C-terminal (non-kinase) half of AKIN10 and the N-terminal portion of PTL. Binding of PTL was specific to AKIN10 as there was little binding to the related AKIN11. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Fluorescently tagged products of 35S:YFP-AKIN10 and 35S:CFP&#x02013;PTL also interacted when transiently expressed together in leaf cells of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. In this case, most of the cytoplasmic AKIN10 was preferentially moved to the nucleus where PTL accumulated, possibly because a nuclear export sequence in AKIN10 was now masked. During these experiments, we observed that AKIN10 could variably accumulate in the Golgi, shown by its co-localization with a tagged Golgi marker and through its dispersal by brefeldin A. Tests of phosphorylation of PTL by AKIN10 gave negative results. The functional significance of the PTL&#x02013;AKIN10 interaction remains open, although a testable hypothesis is that AKIN10 senses lower energy levels in inter-sepal zones and, in association with PTL, promotes reduced cell division.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>AKIN10</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>PETAL LOSS</kwd><kwd>SnRK1</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>trihelix.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organogenesis in plants is associated with the lateral outgrowth of primordia from the periphery of meristems. In the shoot apical meristem, boundaries develop between leaf primordia and the meristem as the leaves arise. In the flower meristem, similar boundaries occur between newly arising whorls of floral organs and the meristem, as well as between organs of the same type within whorls. A common property of boundary regions is a reduced rate of cell proliferation (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Breuil-Broyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This is associated with reduced levels of the growth-promoting hormones auxin (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Heisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and brassinosteroids (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Gendron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The genetic control of boundary formation has been investigated. In most cases, the genes identified encode transcription factors (reviewed by <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">&#x0017d;&#x000e1;dn&#x000ed;kov&#x000e1; and Simon, 2014</xref>). One class encodes NAC transcription factors, involving three <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</italic> (<italic>CUC1/2/3</italic>) genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The expression of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> is downregulated by auxin (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Furutani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Heisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and brassinosteroids (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Gendron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This does not occur in boundary regions where hormone levels are lower, thus allowing their probable function to repress cell division.</p><p content-type="indent">
<italic>PETAL LOSS</italic> (<italic>PTL</italic>) is a boundary gene of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> involved in promoting boundaries between developing sepals (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Griffith <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). It encodes a transcription factor of the trihelix family, and is most strongly expressed between newly arising sepals (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Brewer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Loss of PTL function results in some outward overgrowth of the inter-sepal zone (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, ectopic expression of PTL leads to suppression of growth in any tissue where it is abnormally present (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Brewer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Thus, PTL apparently normally limits cell division in the inter-sepal zone, acting to maintain an appropriate boundary. Genetic studies of interactions between PTL and CUC1 indicated that CUC1 functions differently, repressing upward rather than outward growth in the inter-sepal zone (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Similar genetic investigation of PTL interactions with RABBIT EARS (RBE), a zinc-finger transcription factor active in perianth development, suggested that it also represses tissue growth in this region, although acting independently of PTL (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Despite its name, it seems likely that PTL influences petal initiation only indirectly. Some petals are initiated in early-formed flowers in <italic>ptl</italic> null mutant plants indicating that PTL function is not absolutely required (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Griffith <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Also, <italic>PTL</italic> is not expressed in petal anlagen or primordia (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Genetic interactions with auxin transport mutants revealed that loss of PTL function sensitizes the flower primordium to distortions in auxin dynamics such that almost no petals are formed in double mutants (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Significantly, generation of auxin in the PTL expression zone can rescue petal initiation in <italic>ptl</italic> mutant plants. It may be that overgrowth of the inter-sepal zone in <italic>ptl</italic> mutants is responsible for secondarily disrupting the movement of auxin as a petal initiation signal.</p><p content-type="indent">During a search for partners of the PTL protein in defining the inter-sepal zone, we uncovered a specific protein&#x02013;protein interaction with the energy-sensing kinase AKIN10. AKIN10 acts as a global sensor of energy deprivation, downregulating energy-requiring metabolism and triggering the activation of catabolic processes (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Baena-Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>AKIN10</italic> encodes a kinase &#x003b1;-subunit of Snf1-related kinase1 (SnRK1), and is also known as <italic>KIN10</italic>, <italic>SnRK1.1</italic> and <italic>SnRK1&#x003b1;1</italic>. Snf1 itself is a sugar-non-fermenting protein kinase of yeast that plays a parallel role in regulating metabolism. The process is highly conserved, as equivalent AMP-activated kinases (AMPK1/2) also occur in mammals and are closely related in structure and function to Snf1 and SnRK1 (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Polge and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hedbacker and Carlson 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Halford and Hey, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Ghillebert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hardie, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Crozet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">
<italic>AKIN10</italic>, and another SnRK1 kinase &#x003b1;-subunit gene <italic>AKIN11</italic>, are expressed ubiquitously and at similar levels in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, although a third &#x003b1; gene, <italic>AKIN12</italic>, is expressed at lower levels and only in pollen, developing embryos, and seeds (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Schmid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). AKIN10 is activated by specific upstream kinases in response to energy deprivation (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Sugden <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). This activation is inhibited by trehalose-6-phosphate, a signal of energy sufficiency (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). AKIN10 can then phosphorylate key metabolic enzymes to immediately influence their activity. In addition, it has a longer-term effect on global gene expression through its regulation of specific transcription factors, including several basic leucine zippers that bind G boxes in promoter regions of upregulated target genes (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Baena-Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The mechanism of activation of these bZIPs by AKIN10 is not clear, but AKIN10 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate FUSCA3 (FUS3), a transcription factor of the B3 class involved in embryo maturation (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Gazzarrini, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In the present study, AKIN10 and PTL were shown to bind each other in yeast, <italic>in vitro</italic>, and following transient expression <italic>in planta</italic>. In the latter, much of the cytoplasmic AKIN10 was relocalized to the nucleus, presumably bound to PTL, which accumulates there. The functional significance of this interaction was explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Preparation of cDNA library</title><p>Wild-type Columbia (Col-0) plants were grown at 20 &#x000b0;C under short days (9h light/ 15h dark) for 30 d, and then transferred to long days (16h light/ 8h dark) for 14 d.

Our inflorescence results also extend the observation made in tomato (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Pien <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) that a kinase subunit gene (<italic>LeSNF1</italic>) is not expressed significantly in the shoot meristem except for the epidermis.</p><p content-type="indent">The intracellular localization of AKIN10 has been variously reported. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bitri&#x000e1;n <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> inserted a large genomic fragment including tagged AKIN10 coding sequence into transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants by recombineering. Although the results were reported at low optical resolution, fluorescence in most growing tissues seemed strongest in the region of the plasma membrane and in a cytoplasmic cloud surrounding the nucleus. Usually, it was not clearly apparent inside the nucleus itself. A similar lack of nuclear accumulation was reported in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing 35S:AKIN10 (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Our results, following transient expression in mature leaves of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, revealed accumulation at the plasma membrane and more widely in the cytoplasm, and some nuclear accumulation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear localization has also been reported in similar transient expression studies in intact leaves (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Gazzarrini, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), leaf protoplasts (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and onion epidermal cells (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Paz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, nuclear accumulation has been seen consistently in transient assays but less so in stable transgene experiments, and such differences may result from higher transient expression levels resulting in cytoplasmic saturation and consequent movement into the nucleus.</p><p content-type="indent">We have evidence that small fluorescent punctate bodies seen by us and others in 35S:AKIN10 transient expression experiments (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Paz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Gazzarrini, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) reflect Golgi bodies. We found that their occurrence is variable between cells and may reflect differing physiological conditions. Consistent with this, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> reported that similar bodies (&#x02018;small puncta&#x02019;) developed rapidly in tissues damaged by cutting in both transient and stable expression assays. <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Gazzarrini (2012)</xref> observed similar bodies but did not identify them, although they excluded plastids. This is in contrast to a report that 35S:AKIN10&#x02013;GFP in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants is associated with chloroplasts (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Fragoso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), although different expression systems were involved. <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> also excluded plastids, but they further excluded Golgi, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. Our finding of co-localization of punctate bodies with Golgi is inconsistent with this. It may be that rapid movement of the particles, apparent in time-course images (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv032/-/DC1">Supplementary Movie S1</ext-link>), has masked their correspondence with a Golgi marker.</p><p content-type="indent">It is possible that AKIN10 trafficking in Golgi is simply an abnormal consequence of high levels of expression driven by 35S regulation. This is consistent with their apparent absence in transgenic plants expressing tagged AKIN10 under its endogenous promoter (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bitri&#x000e1;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, such intracellular localization may reflect a natural process only detectable under high expression levels. If this is the case, one possibility is that AKIN10 is normally delivered by the Golgi to the plasma membrane to be associated with &#x003b2;-subunits of SnRK1 that are <italic>N</italic>-myristolated specifically at this location (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Pierre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Does PTL alter the functioning of AKIN10 by influencing its intracellular localization?</title><p>We found that PTL bound AKIN10 and largely sequestered it to the nucleus in transient expression studies. Similar results have been reported for the FUSCA3 transcription factor (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Gazzarrini, 2012</xref>) and for the DUF581 family of nuclear proteins (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Nietzsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). A potential mechanism is that PTL and FUS3 at least, by binding to the C-terminal half of AKIN10, mask the conserved NES in this region, thus helping retain it in the nucleus.</p><p content-type="indent">In yeast, it is significant that activation of the cytoplasmic &#x003b1;-subunit Snf1 by glucose limitation results in its move to the nucleus in association with the &#x003b2;-subunit Gal83 (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hedbacker and Carlson, 2006</xref>), where they may regulate expression of many target genes.</p><p content-type="indent">However, it is not yet known if nuclear relocalization of AKIN10 has a similar functional significance. AKIN10 clearly has cytoplasmic functions. First, it seems likely that &#x003b1;-kinase subunits of SnRK1 (including AKIN10) aggregate with &#x003b2;- and &#x003b2;&#x003b3;-subunits (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Paz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Ramon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) in the cytoplasm, and are activated there by phosphorylation. Secondly, direct target enzymes are likely to be phosphorylated in the cytoplasm. However, despite these cytoplasmic processes, a role for AKIN10 in the nucleus is implied by its nuclear localization seen in some circumstances (discussed above), and by its role in the large-scale reorganization of transcriptional networks (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Baena-Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In conclusion, PTL can undergo a specific interaction with AKIN10 in the nucleus, but further studies are required to establish if this is part of a joint signalling process that dampens growth in the inter-sepal zone where energy is potentially limiting.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s22"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
