 <result pre="SPL13 are expressed at roughly the same level in the" exact="shoot" post="apex. This observation suggests that the differential expression of"/>
 <result pre="may be that SPL3 regulates these physiological processes rather than" exact="shoot" post="morphogenesis. Previously, we suggested [ 57] that the timing"/>
