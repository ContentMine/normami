Here, we show that <italic>OsNAC2</italic>, a member of the NAC transcription factor family, was strongly induced by ABA and osmotic stressors such as drought and high salt. With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions. RNAi plants showed enhanced tolerance to high salinity and drought stress at both the vegetative and flowering stages. Furthermore, RNAi plants had improved yields after drought stress. A microarray assay indicated that many ABA-dependent stress-related genes were down-regulated in <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression lines. We further confirmed that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> directly binds the promoters of <italic>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3</italic>) and <italic>Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1</italic>), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively.

No reports have, however, been published outlining the role of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> in abiotic stress responses.</p><p>In an earlier study, overexpression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> in rice was reported to increase the tiller number<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Our lab previously found that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> was also involved in the regulation of plant height through the GA pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Here, we have shown that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> is induced by ABA and osmotic stressors like drought and high salt. Rice <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression lines had lower drought and high salinity tolerance in both the vegetative and flowering stages compared with wild-type (WT) plants, while in RNAi lines have higher drought and high salinity resistance performance. Additionally, RNAi plants maintained high yields under drought conditions. Gene expression analysis showed that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression down-regulated ABA-dependent stress-related marker genes, suggesting that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> is a negative regulator of the high salinity and drought response pathways. We further explored OsNAC2 target genes using ChIP and yeast-one-hybrid analyses. Our data suggests that OsNAC2 has a new function and regulation mechanism in abiotic stress responses by directly regulating <italic>OsLEA3 (LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3</italic>) and <italic>OsSAPK1 (Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1</italic>). It may, therefore, play an important role in linking the ABA and abiotic stress response pathways together.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>OsNAC2</italic> expression is induced by osmotic stress and ABA</title><p>Expression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> in response to ABA, low temperature, dehydration, and NaCl was analysed using qRT-PCR to show time-dependent induction patterns. The <italic>OsNAC2</italic> transcript accumulated within 2&#x02009;hours under ABA, dehydration, and NaCl treatments, with peak expression reached after 12&#x02009;hours. Conversely, expression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> decreased slightly during 12&#x02009;hours of low-temperature treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). There was no apparent pattern in <italic>OsNAC2</italic> mRNA accumulation in plants treated with water only.</p><p>To study the effect of the promoter region on the expression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> in seedlings under abiotic stress, we generated transgenic rice plants containing a 1500-bp <italic>OsNAC2</italic> promoter fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>) fused with a <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene to visualise is localisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). Histochemical GUS staining indicated that the blue colouration was deepest in the leaves of seedlings treated with NaCl for 2d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and in the roots of seedlings air-dried for 3&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). With both treatments, the expression subsequently decreased as the treatment time increased. The results indicated that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> will be induced by NaCl and mainly expressed in leaf. However, <italic>OsNAC2</italic> was induced by drought treatment and expressed mostly in root. This suggests that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> might play a role in different responses to various abiotic stressors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Changes in <italic>OsNAC2</italic> expression affects salt sensitivity</title><p>Given that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> expression was induced by salt and drought stress, we designed a set of experiments to test its function in abiotic stress tolerance. Therefore, ON7 (<italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression line no. 7), ON11 (<italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression line no. 11), RNAi18 (<italic>OsNAC2</italic> RNAi line no. 18), RNAi31 (<italic>OsNAC2</italic> RNAi line no. 31), and WT plants were evaluated for high salinity tolerance and drought stress. In <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression lines, OsNAC2 is promoted by 35&#x02009;S, and fused with GFP-tag. Two-week-old rice seedlings were treated with 150&#x02009;mM NaCl for 2.5 d. After high salt treatment, plants were transferred to recover in normal water for 2 d. All the plants grew well under normal conditions. After high salt treatment and recovery, ON7 and ON11 plants were severely withered and had damaged leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Compared with the WT, significantly more seedlings of the ON7 and ON11 overexpression lines withered (58.5% and 81.3%. respectively). Of the RNAi18 and RNAi31 seedlings, 10.4% and 9.8% withered, respectively, whereas 29.0% of the WT seedlings withered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We used diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining to test reactive oxygen species in all the plant lines. Under normal conditions (CK), there was no DAB staining in WT and transgenic plants. After high salt treatment, DAB staining accumulated in ON7 and ON11 leaves and, to a lesser degree, in the leaves of RNAi and WT seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results indicated greater ROS accumulation in overexpression lines after high salinity stress. We also evaluated the effect of salt stress by examining electrolyte leakage and relative fresh weight. All the plants had low electrolyte leakage under normal growth conditions. Overexpression plants exhibited a significantly lower relative fresh weight than WT plants while RNAi18 and RNAi31 had significantly higher fresh weights compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). At the same time, a greater increase in electrolyte leakage was found in ON7 and ON11 plants than in WT plants after 150&#x02009;mM NaCl treatment, while RNAi18 and RNAi31 plants had markedly smaller increases in electrolyte leakage than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These results indicated that overexpression of OsNAC2 suppresses salt resistance in transgenic plant.</p><p>Compared with hydroponics, growing plants in pots of soil more closely resembles the real growing environment of rice. All the rice seedlings were, therefore, grown hydroponically until they were 4 w old before being transferred into pots for soil experiments. After 14 d of 150&#x02009;mM NaCl treatment, the leaves of ON7 and ON11 plants were yellow and wilting while the leaves of RNAi31 plants remained green and upright (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Approximately 50% of ON7 and ON11 plants had died by this point while approximately 60% of the corresponding WT plants and over 70% of the RNAi31 plants remained alive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also evaluated the viability of all the plants by measuring fresh weights. Before NaCl treatment, there were no significant differences in the fresh weight of WT and transgenic rice seedlings under normal soil conditions. After high salt stress, ON11 lines lost more fresh weight than the corresponding WT plants while RNAi31 lost less fresh weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Chlorophyll plays an important role in plant growth and development. After salt stress, more chlorophyll was degraded in ON11 than in the WT plants while more chlorophyll was conserved in the RNAi31 plants compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These data demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> could make rice more sensitive to high salt stress whether in hydroponic or soil culture conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Changes in <italic>OsNAC2</italic> expression affect drought sensitivity</title><p>As with salinity stress, <italic>OsNAC2</italic> transcription was also induced by drought treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), suggesting that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> might also play an important role in the response to drought stress. We used PEG8000 to mimic natural drought conditions. Two-week-old transgenic and WT rice seedlings were transferred into nutrient solution with 20% PEG8000. After 5d treatment and 3d recovery, more leaves of the overexpression lines ON7 and ON11 (62.5% and 86.5%, respectively) had rolled into a needle-like shape than the WT (28.1%), while less RNAi18 and RNAi31 plants had turned yellow (18.8% and 9.4%, respectively) but no needle-like shape leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b,c,e</xref>). DAB staining and analysis of the relative fresh weight and electrolyte leakage were performed to evaluate the drought resistant phenotype. Greater ROS accumulation was observed in ON7 and ON11 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and both lost more fresh weight than the WT plants during PEG treatment and had significantly more electrolyte leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>).</p><p>Our results confirmed that overexpression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> decreased the tolerance of rice to the PEG solution leading us to assume that changes in <italic>OsNAC2</italic> expression would affect the drought sensitivity of rice. To evaluate the drought tolerance of transgenic and WT rice seedlings we used four-week-old transgenic seedlings that were grown in pots alongside corresponding WT plants. In normal conditions, no phenotypic differences were observed and each seedling was healthy. After 14 d without watering, ON7 and ON11 seedlings turned yellow and wilted while RNAi31 plants remained green. These differences became more obvious after 7 d of re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The survival rate of ON7 and ON11 significantly decreased compared with the WT, while the survival rate of RNAi31 increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> value, which represents the activity of PSII, was used to evaluate the extent of rice plant damage, with more damaged plants having lower values. The F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> values were lower in ON11 than in the WT, while the values were higher in RNAi31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The post-treatment fresh weights correlated with the <italic>OsNAC2</italic> transcript level; ON7 and ON11 had lower fresh weights than the WT while RNAi31 plants had higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These data indicated that overexpression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> could make rice plants more sensitive to drought stress at the vegetative stage.</p><p>As rice yields and phenotypes are hypersensitive to drought stress during flower development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, we tested the drought tolerance of transgenic rice at this stage. All the seedlings were grown in pots under normal growth conditions before they reached the heading stage. Control pots were watered regularly while those of drought treatment groups were not irrigated for 12 d until harvest. Phenotypic analysis of the different lines after water deficient and recovery shown that ON7 and ON11 suffered severe growth retardation and high senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We measured several agronomic traits to evaluate the drought damage to rice. After drought treatment, ON7 and ON11 plants had the lowest 1000-grain weight, while RNAi18 plants had the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). The seed setting rate of ON7 and ON11 was also visibly lower than in WT while RNAi18 plants had a significantly higher seed setting rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). These results further confirmed that overexpression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> made rice plants hypersensitive to drought tolerance and decreased their yield under drought stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stress-related marker genes are all down-regulated in <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression plants</title><p>The above results showed that overexpression of OsNAC2 reduced plant tolerances to drought and high salinity stress. To further explore the regulation mechanism of OsNAC2 in the abiotic stress response pathway, we performed gene expression profiling analysis compared WT and <italic>OsNAC2</italic>-overexpressing plants using the existing rice microarray data in our lab. Compared with WT, many stress response genes were expressed in different patterns in the ON lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). According to the gene descriptions, we discovered that many of these differentially expressed genes are involved in drought and high salinity stress responses and may interact with the ABA signalling pathway. Some genes, including <italic>LEA3</italic>, some GTPases (<italic>RAB21, RAB16C, RAB16D</italic>), and sucrose nonfermenting1&#x02013;related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) protein kinase genes (<italic>SAPK1</italic> and <italic>SAPK10</italic>), that function in ABA signalling and stress tolerance were significantly down-regulated in ON11 plants compared with the WT in the result of real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). These results verified the microarray data and revealed a potential relationship between <italic>OsNAC2</italic> and the ABA-dependent stress signalling pathway.</p><p>Based on previous reports and our data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, we examined two other ABA signalling pathway genes to confirm the relationship between <italic>OsNAC2</italic> and ABA signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). <italic>OsbZIP46</italic> and <italic>OsbZIP72</italic> are two members of the third subfamily of bZIP transcription factors in rice, which belong to the bZIP TF family and act downstream of ABA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. <italic>OsbZIP46</italic> and <italic>OsbZIP72</italic> are positive regulators of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The higher transcription of these two genes in RNAi lines matches our previous result that RNAi lines had higher stress resistance. Besides, more stress-related genes are checked. <italic>OsAsr5, OsDEG10, OsSAP1</italic> and <italic>HKT1</italic>;5 are stress marker genes, which responds to ABA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, and participates in stress signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, stress tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Those genes all showed up-regulated transcription in RNAi lines and might confer stress tolerance in RNAi lines. In conclusion, overexpression of OsNAC2 brings two major differences, one is altered ABA-signaling pathway, and the other is more severe stress phenotypes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of the stress marker gene <italic>OsLEA3</italic> and SnRK2 protein kinase gene <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> are regulated by direct binding of OsNAC2 to their promoters</title><p>We have shown that overexpression of OsNAC2 reduced plant tolerances to drought and high salinity stress. To identify the target genes of OsNAC2, we performed ChIP-seq where we scanned the promoter region of several stress-related and ABA-pathway genes. We found binding peaks in four of the candidate genes: <italic>OsLEA3</italic> (0&#x02009;bp~&#x02212;200bp and &#x02212;900bp~&#x02212;1100bp), <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> (&#x02212;900bp~&#x02212;1100bp)<italic>, OsABA8ox3</italic> (0&#x02009;bp~&#x02212;200bp), and <italic>OsRAB16A</italic> (&#x02212;100~&#x02212;250bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). To further confirm whether these genes are direct targets of OsNAC2 we performed a yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP-qPCR. Here we use <italic>OsNAC2</italic> overexpression line 11 (ON11) and WT (as negative control) for this assay. In transgenic line ON11, a GFP-tag was fused with <italic>OsNAC2</italic> CDS, which was promoted by 35&#x02009;S. In the yeast one-hybrid assay, the coding region of the full-length <italic>OsNAC2</italic> cDNA was fused in frame to the GAL4 activation domain of the pGADT7 vector. Promoter sequence regions of <italic>OsLEA3</italic> (1063&#x02009;bp), <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> (1080&#x02009;bp)<italic>, OsABA8OX3</italic> (1090&#x02009;bp) and <italic>OsRab16A</italic> (1090&#x02009;bp) were ligated into the pHIS vector.

Most <italic>NAC</italic> genes have been reported to work as positive stress response TFs. For instance, <italic>SNAC1</italic> can greatly increase the drought and high salinity tolerance of rice by decreasing the transpiration rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

The function of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> went exactly opposite to other reported <italic>NAC</italic> members like <italic>OsNAC5, OsNAC6</italic> and <italic>OsNAC10</italic>. We inferred that OsNAC2 might have new features and pathways in the regulation of abiotic stress in rice, which could enrich the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of NAC family.</p><p>The heading stage, which can also be called flowering stage, is the most critical period in rice agricultural production. During this period rice plants are most sensitive to drought and grain yield is more severely affected by drought stress than at any other stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. We performed drought stress experiments at the flowering stage in WT and transgenic plants to determine whether OsNAC2 influenced grain yield under drought conditions. The grain yield of WT and transgenic plants did not differ under normal cultural conditions. After drought stress at the flowering stage, however, RNAi plants showed a significantly higher seed setting rate. In terms of 1000-grain weight, RNAi lines also showed significantly higher grain yields than WT lines. In summary, various agricultural traits, such as the seed-setting rate and 1000-grain weight of RNAi lines were significantly higher than that in WT lines after drought treatment at the flowering stage. <italic>SNAC1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <italic>OsNAC5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and <italic>OsNAC10</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> enhanced drought resistance in transgenic rice plants at the reproductive stage without affecting yield. Consistent with other NAC family members, therefore, we believe that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> represents a practical means of guiding rice agricultural production in drought or salt stress conditions.</p><p>Compared with WT plants, we found that many TF and stress-related genes were down-regulated in ON11 lines in our rice gene microarray chip. The expression levels of some of these genes were checked using qRT-PCR and this confirmed that all of these genes were down-regulated in ON11 lines. Many assays have reported that NAC family members can regulate stress-related gene expression resulting in transgenic rice plants with altered tolerance under different adverse conditions. ONAC045<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and OsNAC5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> can directly bind to the promoter region of <italic>OsLEA3</italic>. The <italic>SNAC1</italic> promoter contained two DREs, and ABA-responsive elements could be identified in the <italic>OsNAC6</italic> promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesise that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> may down-regulate these stress genes in response to abiotic stress.</p><p>Notably, most of the marker genes we tested were ABA-responsive genes. Some are ABA signalling pathway genes, such as <italic>OsbZIP46</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and <italic>OsbZIP72</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. OsbZIP46, reported to be involved in stress resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, was phosphorylated by <italic>OsSAPK2, OsSAPK6</italic>, and <italic>OsSAPK9</italic>. Other ABA-responsive genes examined here are stress related genes that are up-regulated by ABA including <italic>OsASR5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, <italic>OsDEG10</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, <italic>OsSAP1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and <italic>OsHKT1</italic>;5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. We believe that OsNAC2 regulates abiotic stress through an ABA-dependent pathway by acting as a negative regulator of ABA and stress responsive genes. Additionally, we found that OsNAC2 can directly bind to the promoters of <italic>OsLEA3</italic> and <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>) and down-regulate their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). <italic>OsLEA3</italic> is a widely known stress marker gene, overexpression of which confers plant stress resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> belongs to the SnRK2 family that can be upregulated by osmotic stressors such as salt and mannitol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Here, we found that <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> expression can be directly regulated by OsNAC2 in response to abiotic stressors like drought and high salinity in rice.</p><p>To further investigate the biological function of <italic>OsNAC2</italic>, we constructed <italic>OsNAC2</italic>-overexpressing and RNAi lines. During cultivation we found several different phenotypes in the overexpression lines including shorter roots, shorter shoot lengths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and premature leaf senescence (data not shown). This is consistent with evidence that plant tolerance to abiotic stress is often closely associated with growth and development. Root-specific overexpression of <italic>OsNAC10</italic> enlarges roots, enhancing the drought tolerance of transgenic plants and increasing their grain yield significantly under field drought conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Conversely, <italic>OsNAC5</italic> can improve the stress tolerance of rice without affecting its growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Our results show that <italic>OsNAC2</italic> functions through the ABA-dependent pathway and may down-regulate many ABA-responsive stress marker genes. Previous work in our lab on <italic>OsNAC2</italic> has indicated that it functions in plant height development and potentially in root development (data not published), and in senescence (data not published). Combined with the results of this study, <italic>OsNAC2</italic> may be a powerful TF that serves as a node to link multiple pathways together.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the expression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> was induced by osmotic stress and ABA. Overexpression of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> resulted in transgenic rice plants that were sensitive to high salinity and drought stress at different growth stages. OsNAC2 directly down-regulated the stress-related marker gene <italic>OsLEA3</italic> and SnRK2 family gene <italic>OsSAPK1</italic> via the ABA-dependent pathway. Future work is required to determine the specific position of <italic>OsNAC2</italic> in the underlying regulatory network in more detail.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plants, strain and plasmid</title><p>Wild type rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) which have an ecotype of Nipponbare, were saved in our lab.
