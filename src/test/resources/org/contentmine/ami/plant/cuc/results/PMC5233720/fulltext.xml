Ginger is an extensively used spice due to its unique flavor and immense medicinal value. The two major threats that interfere with the large scale production of ginger are the salinity and drought stress. ZoCDPK1 (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> Calcium-dependent protein kinase 1) is a salinity and drought-inducible CDPK gene isolated from ginger and undergoes dynamic subcellular localization during stress conditions. ZoCDPK1, with signature features of a typical Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated kinase, also possesses a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in its junction domain (JD). A striking feature in ZoCDPK1 is the rare occurrence of a coupling between the NLS in JD and consensus sequences in regulatory domain. Here, we further identified its nature of nuclear localization and its interaction partners. In the homology model generated for ZoCDPK1, the regulatory domain mimics the crystal structure of the regulatory domain in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CDPK1. Molecular docking simulation of importin (ZoIMP&#x003b1;), an important protein involved in nuclear translocation, into the NLS of ZoCDPK1 was well-visualized. Furthermore, the direct interaction of ZoCDPK1 and ZoIMP&#x003b1; proteins was studied by the yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) system, which confirmed that junction domain (JD) is an important interaction module required for ZoCDPK1 and ZoIMP&#x003b1; binding. The probable interacting partners of ZoCDPK1 were also identified using Y2H experiment. Of the 10 different stress-related interacting partners identified for ZoCDPK1, NAC transcription factor (TF) needs special mention, especially in the context of ZoCDPK1 function. The interaction between ZoCDPK1 and NAC TF, in fact, corroborate with the results of gene expression and over-expression studies of ZoCDPK1. Hence ZoCDPK1 is operating through NAC TF mediated ABA-independent, cold non-responsive stress signaling pathway in ginger.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calcium-dependent protein kinase</kwd><kwd>ginger</kwd><kwd>importin</kwd><kwd>nuclear localization sequence</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100006144</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">1418/C3/06/KSCSTE</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="66"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="9673"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Salinity, drought, extreme temperatures, chemical toxicity, pathogen infection, and oxidative stress are serious threats to agriculture and the natural status of the environment (Easterling et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Fischer and Edmeades, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Responses to different stress stimuli could be achieved through an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and relay of divergent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transduction cascades (Kudla et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures may be recognized by different sensor proteins. Three major families of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors have been identified in higher plants: Calmodulins (CaMs) and CaM-like proteins (Perochon et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins (Luan, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) (Deinlein et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Among them, CDPKs are the best characterized and are unique in plants. CDPKs are composed of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing and a protein kinase effector domain in a single protein and thus represent a key player for both perception and signal propagation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes upon various stimuli (Deinlein et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>CDPKs are specific to the plant kingdom and some protozoans but absent in animals and fungi. They comprise a protein family with 34 members in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Hrabak et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and 31 members in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (Ray et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). All family members share a conserved modular structure, consisting of an N-terminal variable domain (NV), a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase effector domain (KD), a junction domain (JD), a regulatory or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing calmodulin-like domain (CaM-LD) with four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hand motifs and a C-terminal variable (CV) domain (Harmon, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The N-terminal domains of CDPKs vary in length from 40 to 180 amino acids, and there is no significant homology in the sequence even between family members (Harmon, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The JD between the kinase and CaM-LD functions as a pseudo-substrate autoinhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and keeps the CDPK in a state of low activity (Harmon et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). The CaM-LD of CDPKs consist of two structural domains (termed the N and C &#x0201c;lobes&#x0201d;), each containing two EF hand helix-loop-helix Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#x02212; binding motifs. Activation of CDPK occurs when Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels rise to fill the two weaker affinity-binding sites in the N-lobe, thereby triggering a conformational change that leads to release of autoinhibitory region (Christodoulou et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). CDPKs are found in multiple locations including the cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, mitochondrial outer membrane, and oil bodies (Harper et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Dehydration, chilling temperature, salinity and hormones can all induce specific changes in the expression of CDPK genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, tobacco, and wheat (Yoon et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ma and Wu, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wan et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Franz et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Ginger is a widely utilized spice crop not only for enhancing the flavor and aroma of food but also for treating diverse diseases. Salinity and drought stress are serious impediments in the commercial cultivation of ginger (Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ajav and Ogunlade, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We have reported earlier that ZoCDPK1, a stress-inducible CDPK in ginger, functions in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to salinity and drought stress. Its over-expression has shown to provide salinity and drought tolerance in tobacco (Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). An interesting feature of ZoCDPK1 is the presence of a bipartite NLS in its JD and hence it can interact with nuclear transporting proteins for its nuclear localization. This was further supported by the predominant nuclear localization of ZoCDPK1 (Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The importin-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer targets hundreds of proteins to the nuclear-pore complex (NPC) and facilitates their translocation across the nuclear envelope. Importin-&#x003b1; binds to NLS-containing proteins and links them to importin-&#x003b2;, and translocate to the nucleus (Goldfarb et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Importin-&#x003b1;s are composed of a flexible N-terminal importin-&#x003b2;-binding (IBB) domain and a highly structured domain comprised of ten tandem armadillo (ARM) repeats (Fontes et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The helical ARM repeats assemble into a twisted slug-like structure, whose belly serves as the NLS-binding groove.</p><p>In order to understand the possible ginger CDPK1 regulated pathway, it is very much essential to identify the possible interaction partners of ZoCDPK1 gene. Here we report that the predominant nuclear localization of ZoCDPK1 is through the interaction between NLS containing domain of the CDPK (JD) and importin-&#x003b1; protein (ZoIMP&#x003b1;). We extended this finding with <italic>in silico</italic> docking studies of ginger CDPK1 with importin-&#x003b1;. To know further about the proteins involved in this signal transduction, we have studied the interaction of ZoCDPK1 with ginger cDNA library.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Homology modeling</title><p>The sequence of ZoCDPK1 was subjected to a homology search using BLAST and PSI-BLAST against NCBI PDB database. No full length template was obtained for modeling the sequence. As it was found that the protein template 2BDW (kinase domain of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> CaMKII) and 2AAO (regulatory domain of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> CDPK1) showed significant sequence identity with the kinase domain and CaM-LD of ZoCDPK1 respectively, their PDB co-ordinates were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/</ext-link>). Homology modeling was carried out using MODELLER9 (Sali and Blundell, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) based on the sequence alignment generated between template and target sequences. The atomic coordinates were obtained from template structures for modeling ZoCDPK1. Energy minimization of the top scored model was carried out with GROMACS 3.3.1 (Van Der Spoel et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) using OPLSAA force field. The minimization was set to run for 5000 steps or until convergence to machine precision. PROSA2003 (Wiederstein and Sippl, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) programme was used for validation of the model, by analyzing residue interaction energy and <italic>Z</italic>-score. These procedures were iterated several times until a good quality model was obtained.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In silico</italic> protein-protein interaction</title><p>A protein-protein interaction docking was performed for ZoCDPK1 with importin-&#x003b1; using ZDOCK and RDOCK (Wiehe et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) installed locally. The structure of importin-&#x003b1; was taken from PDB (1PJN), in which an NLS peptide complexed with the protein was removed before docking study. Since it was expected that the NLS region in the JD of ZoCDPK1 should interact with the NLS peptide binding residues found in importin, those residues were specified for filtering in ZDOCK. RDOCK refinement was performed on the top 10 poses of the filtered ZDOCK output. The top scored model obtained from RDOCK was used as a starting point for local searches using the RosettaDock server (Lyskov and Gray, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) in which 10000 structures were independently calculated and energetically scored. The energetically best structure complex was filtered and subjected to further investigations. Visualization of structures was accomplished with PyMol 0.99rc6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org/">http://www.pymol.org/</ext-link>). The electrostatic potential on the surface of the proteins was calculated by solving the Poisson&#x02013;Boltzmann equation using the program APBS (Baker et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of importin-&#x003b1; (ZoIMP&#x003b1;) from ginger</title><p>Nucleotide sequences corresponding to importin-&#x003b1; were retrieved from ginger EST database and aligned together to get the full length information. In order to get the full length gene IMPF (5&#x02032;-GAGCGCCGCCATGGAGATGTCGCTCCGGCCGAGCGAG-3&#x02032;) and IMPR (5&#x02032;- TCGAGCTCGATGGATCCCGCTGAAGTCGAATCCACCA-3&#x02032;) primers were designed from this sequence information and PCR was carried out using cDNA of ginger. The PCR was carried out in a 50 &#x003bc;L reaction mixture containing 1.0 &#x003bc;L of cDNA, 5x Phusion High-Fidelity Reaction Buffer, 200 &#x003bc;M of each dNTPs, 0.6 &#x003bc;L of Phusion DNA Polymerase (2 U/&#x003bc;L; NEB, England) and 20 pmol each of IMPF and IMPR. The reaction mixture was denatured at 98&#x000b0;C for 30 s followed by 35 cycles (98&#x000b0;C for 10 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min) and a final incubation at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The product was cloned into pGEM&#x000ae;-T Easy vector and sequenced using T7 and Sp6 primers. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ZoIMP&#x003b1; were subjected to analysis using BLASTN, PSI-BLAST, and PHI-BLAST.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid experiment</title><p>A Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used to study (i) the interaction of ZoCDPK1 with ginger importin-&#x003b1; and (ii) the interaction of ZoCDPK1 with ginger Y2H library proteins. For ZoCDPK1-importin interaction, Matchmaker&#x02122; GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech, USA) was used. For ZoCDPK1-library interaction Matchmaker&#x02122; Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System (Clontech, USA) was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of cDNA from RNA using SMART&#x02122;technology</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from leaves of salinity stressed ginger plants by TRIzol&#x000ae; method (Invitrogen, USA). From this Poly (A) RNA was isolated from total RNA with NucleoTrap&#x000ae; mRNA kit (Clontech, USA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. 1 &#x003bc;g of poly (A) RNA was reverse transcribed using SMART M-MLV reverse transcriptase and further converted to ds cDNA using SMART technology as per manufacturer's protocol (Clontech, USA). The ds cDNA was purified using CHROMA SPIN TE-400 column to select DNA molecules greater than 200 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of <italic>Z. officinale</italic> yeast two-hybrid library</title><p>For ginger library construction Y187 yeast competent cells were prepared according to the protocol of the Yeastmaker Yeast Transformation System 2 (Clontech, USA). About 20 &#x003bc;L of the ds cDNA of ginger (2&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g) and 3 &#x003bc;g of pGADT7 were co-transformed into the yeast strain Y187 to construct the ginger Y2H library according to the protocol mentioned in Make Your Own &#x0201c;Mate &#x00026; Plate&#x02122;&#x0201d; Library System (Clontech, USA). To determine the complexity of the library, 100 &#x003bc;L of 1/10 and 1/100 dilutions of transformed cells were spread on SD/&#x02212;Leu (synthetically defined medium lacking leucine) 100 mm agar plates. After incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;4 days, the number of colonies on dilution plates was counted and the transformation efficiency was calculated. To identify the titer of the constructed ginger Y2H library, 10 &#x003bc;L of library aliquot was taken out and diluted to 1/100, 1/1000, 1/10000, and 1/1000000. The last two dilutions were spread in duplicate on SD/&#x02212;Leu 100 mm agar plates, and the library titer was calculated according to the colonies appearing (Fu et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The bait and prey constructs</title><p>In a Matchmaker GAL4-based two-hybrid assay, a bait protein is expressed as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD), while libraries of prey proteins are expressed as fusions with the Gal4 activation domain (AD). To this end four different bait vectors namely CD1-F (Full length ZoCDPK1), CD1-VK (NV-K domain of ZoCDPK1 only), CD1-JRV (JD-CaMLD-CV of ZoCDPK1), and CD1-RV (CaMLD-CV of ZoCDPK1) were made by amplifying the appropriate portion of ZoCDPK1 by PCR. The PCR was carried out in a 50 &#x003bc;L reaction mixture containing 100 ng of plasmid DNA (containing ZoCDPK1 clone), 5x Phusion High-Fidelity Reaction Buffer, 200 &#x003bc;M of each dNTPs, 1.25 U of Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB, England) and 20 pmol each of forward and reverse primers (Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The primers used were CD1YF1 (5&#x02032;-CATGGAGGCCGAATTCATGGGAAATTCCTTCGTCTGCTGC-3&#x02032;) and CD1YR1 (5&#x02032;- GCAGGTCGACGGATCCTGACGGATGGTTTGCGTCTTTATC-3&#x02032;) for CD1-F; CD1YF1 and CD1YR3 (5&#x02032;-GCAGGTCGACGGATCCCAACCATGGATGTTCCAACACCTG-3&#x02032;) for CD1-VK; CD1YF2 (5&#x02032;-CATGGAGGCCGAATTCCAAAATGCCAAGAAGGCTTCCAAT-3&#x02032;) and CD1YR1 for CD1-JRV; CD1YF3 (5&#x02032;-CATGGAGGCCGAATTCGTTATCAGAGACATGTTTAGGTTA-3&#x02032;) and CD1YR1 for CD1-RV. They were then cloned in-frame into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech) and expressed as a fusion with the yeast GAL4 DNA-BD.</p><p>Two different prey constructs were used in <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction studies. For one-to-one interaction, coding region of ZoIMP&#x003b1; was amplified by PCR in a 50 &#x003bc;L reaction mixture containing 100 ng of plasmid DNA (containing ZoIMP&#x003b1; clone), 5x Phusion High-Fidelity Reaction Buffer, 200 &#x003bc;M of each dNTPs, 1.25 U of Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB, England) and 20 pmol of IMPYF (5&#x02032;- GAGCGCCGCCATGGAGATGTCGCTCCGGCCGAGCGAGAGG-3&#x02032;) and IMPYR (5&#x02032;- GCAGGTCGACGGATCCCTTATCGCCGATCCGGCTGCGGAG-3&#x02032;) and cloned in-frame into the <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of the activation domain vector pGADT7 (Clontech). All constructs were verified by direct DNA sequence analysis using T7 primer, DNA-BD primer and AD primer. For library screening, ginger cDNA library (salinity stress induced) cloned in pGADT7 and transformed in yeast strain Y187 were used as prey.</p></sec><sec><title>ZoCDPK1-importin-&#x003b1; interaction</title><p>To check the interactions between different domains of ZoCDPK1 and ZoIMP&#x003b1; protein, AD and BD vectors containing the desired plasmids were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 harboring two reporter genes (HIS3 and &#x003b2;-galactosidase) by lithium acetate method. Separate co-transformations were carried out for all the four bait constructs. In each co-transformation, 5 &#x003bc;g of both AD (CD1-F/CD1-VK/CD1-JRV/CD1-RV) and BD plasmids and 100 &#x003bc;g of denatured carrier DNA (ssDNA) were combined in a pre-chilled sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and 100 &#x003bc;L of yeast competent cells were added to it and mixed gently. To each reaction mix 600 &#x003bc;L of TE-LiAc/PEG solution was added and mixed by vortexing. All four reaction mixtures were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 30 min with gently mixing on every 10 min by tapping. After incubation 70 &#x003bc;L DMSO was added to each tube and was placed in a 42&#x000b0;C water bath for 15 min. The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 s. The supernatant was removed from each tube and the pellets were re-suspended in 0.5 mL 1x TE buffer separately. The centrifugation and re-suspension steps were repeated two more times and the final pellet in each tube was re-suspended in 200 &#x003bc;L of 1x TE buffer separately. Yeast cells carrying both the plasmids were selected on synthetic medium lacking Leu and Trp (SD-Leu&#x02013;Trp-). The plates of all the four co-transformation reactions were incubated upside down at 30&#x000b0;C until colonies appear (3&#x02013;5 days).</p><p>AH109 contains integrated copies of ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ (MAL1) reporter genes under the control of distinct GAL4 upstream activating sequences (Kamei et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and TATA boxes. These promoters yield strong and very specific responses to GAL4. For all the four reactions, the positives colonies from the double drop out plates were then streaked onto an SD medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His (Leu-Trp-His-) and with 15 mM 3-AT to determine the expression of HIS3 nutritional reporter.</p><p>The &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression of the His<sup>+</sup> colonies was analyzed by filter-lift assays as described by the manufacturer (Clontech, USA). In order to do filter-lift assay, single colony from each plate (CD1-F, CD1-VK, CD1-JRV, and CD1-RV) was patched separately on a YPD plate and incubated for 1 day at 30&#x000b0;C. A sterile Whatman No. 3 filter paper was pre-soaked by placing it in 5 mL of Z buffer/X-gal solution in a clean 150 mm plate. Using forceps, a clean, dry filter paper was placed over the surface of the colonies grown on the YPD plate and gently rubbed the filter with the side of the forceps to help colonies cling to the filter. When the filter has been evenly wetted, carefully lifted it off the plate with forceps and transferred it (colonies facing up) to a pool of liquid nitrogen. Using the forceps, the filters were completely submerged. After the filter has frozen completely (~10 s), removed it from the liquid nitrogen and allowed it to thaw at RT. Then carefully placed the filter, colony side up, on the presoaked filter paper by avoiding air bubbles trapped under or between the filters and incubated the filters at 30&#x000b0;C and checked periodically for the appearance of blue colonies. The &#x003b2;-galactosidase producing colonies were identified by aligning the filter to the agar plate using the orienting marks.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening of libraries</title><p>To screen proteins from ginger (stress induced) cDNA library interacting with ZoCDPK1, the bait protein with complete coding sequences of ZoCDPK1 cloned into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech, USA) and expressed as a fusion with the yeast GAL4 DNA-BD (Fu et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For this purpose, the complete ORF of ZoCDPK1 was amplified from cDNA by PCR using the primers, CD1YF1 and CD1YR1. Before screening, the bait protein was tested against the autoactivity and toxicity of ZoCDPK1 in the absence of a prey ginger library. A concentrated Y2HGold (pBD-ZoCDPK1) culture was mixed with 1 mL of Y187 (pAD-ginger) Y2H library for mating in accordance with the Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid protocol (Clontech, USA). Thirty 150 mm DDO/A (double dropout medium lacking tryptophan and leucine supplemented with Aureobasidin A) plates were used to screen the clones after mating for 3&#x02013;5 days. All blue colonies were then patched out and allowed to grow on QDO/A (quadruple dropout medium lacking adenine, histidine, tryptophan and leucine and supplemented with Aureobasidin A) plates (Fu et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The blue colonies were screened twice on QDO/X/A plates to rescue additional library plasmids and eliminate false positives. Meanwhile, the bait plasmid (pGBKT7-ZoCDPK1) was co-transformed into Y2HGold with the prey plasmid (pGADT7-T) to serve as negative control, respectively (Fu et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Gao et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The AD/library was further screened by yeast colony PCR using Matchmaker Insert Check PCR mix (Clontech, USA) for eliminating duplicates. For PCR of each colony, a very small amount of cells were picked using a toothpick and placed on a tube containing 25 &#x003bc;L of PCR grade water. To this 25 &#x003bc;L of Matchmaker Insert Check PCR Mix was added and mixed up and down for 5 times. The thermal cycling parameters were as follows: Initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 10 s; 68&#x000b0;C for 3 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/EtBr gel. The products were further cloned and sequenced.

As structural details of full length CDPKs were very much limited, two templates 2BDW and 2AAO were selected for homology modeling as they showed significant homologies with kinase and CaM-LD of ZoCDPK1 respectively. The alignment of sequences of both the templates with ZoCDPK1 is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Among the five models generated by MODELLER for ZoCDPK1, the minimum energy structure was selected for further analysis.

The JD can be divided into three segments. The first is the bipartite NLS bearing region, which may be responsible for its nuclear localization by binding with importin. The second is a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory region which blocks the substrate binding site of the kinase domain in the inactivated state. Finally there is a CaM-LD binding domain, which involves in the activation of the protein in presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Homology model of ZoCDPK1.

The templates chosen for full length modeling of ZoCDPK1 showed optimum homology and the PROSA2003 <italic>Z</italic>-scores of the model and template structures were more or less similar which indicated the quality of the model. The regulatory domain of ZoCDPK1 full length model was found to mimic closely with the crystal and modeled structure of CaM-LD of CDPK1 (CPK-1) from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Chandran et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). One striking feature of the structure is the interaction between N and C lobe of the CaM-LD and such a type of interaction is essential for the activation of CDPKs. Interestingly, the NMR model of the CaM-LD of soybean CDPK&#x003b1; and AtCDPK1 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also reveals an inter-domain contact, but surprisingly, the interacting residues are not completely similar (Weljie and Vogel, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Chandran et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In CDPKs, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity of the C-lobe is significantly greater than that of the N-lobe. It suggests that there are differential roles of the two lobes in the activation of CDPKs, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loading of the N-lobe as the likely trigger for physiological CPDK activation. In canonical CDPKs, at basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels high affinity binding sites in the C-lobe are occupied and it interacts with the junction domain, but the kinase remains in an auto-inhibited state. Activation occurs when Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels rise to fill the two weaker affinity binding sites in the N-lobe, which alters its interaction with the C-lobe triggering a conformational change that leads to the exposure of the catalytic site and activation (Christodoulou et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hence such a type of inter-domain communication is mandatory for the activation of CDPKs. In the present CDPK structure, the interaction between C-terminal segments of the JD region with residues in the C-terminal lobe of the CaM-LD is not significant and moreover, a closer association between N-lobe of CaM-LD and JD was noticed. Considering all the above observations, it may be concluded that the molecular model of ginger CDPK generated in the study represents the structure of an active CDPK.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear translocation of ZoCDPK1 is mediated through importin-&#x003b1; binding to its JD</title><p>The prediction of importin mediated nuclear localization of ZoCDPK1 was substantiated by molecular docking studies with importin-&#x003b1;, and it was further confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction studies. Importin-&#x003b1; is the nuclear import receptor that recognizes cargo proteins carrying conventional basic monopartite and bipartite nuclear localization sequences(NLS) and facilitates their transport to the nucleus. A known mechanism for regulating the activity of NLS is masking it in order to prevent its recognition by importins (Jans, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Vandromme et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). It is interesting to note that by virtue of having the NLS in the JD, this target group of CDPKs can have their NLS masked by the catalytic domain in the inactive form of the kinase. But at saturating concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the NLS may be exposed due to the removal of interaction between JD and kinase. The template chosen for regulatory domain modeling was a Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound one; hence our model describes the structure of an active CDPK as indicated by the exposed nature of NLS. Moreover, as described earlier, the N-lobe of CaM-LD of ZoCDPK1 shows association with JD, which is a feature of active CDPK. So it may be possible that ZoCDPK1 is interacting with importin-&#x003b1; at its active state and further translocated to the nucleus which in turn justifies its involvement in multiple stress signaling.</p><p>Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions appear to be important stabilizing forces determining the local structure of JD, which in turn influences the orientation of NLS and ultimately the binding within the importin protein. Interestingly, it was consistent with the expectations for intermolecular interactions where the hydrophobic forces stabilize the protein&#x02013;protein interaction and the electrostatic forces orient the molecules and confer specificity to the interaction. The ZoCDPK1 homology model illustrates that Lys325, Lys326, Arg337, Arg339, and Lys341 are located in the N and C terminal of NLS. Within this region, the columbic interactions among Asp192, Asp264, Glu266, Asp280, Asp325, Asp326, Glu354, Asp390, Glu396, Asp433 of importin and the orientation of hydrophobic residues may be vital for appropriate ZoCDPK1-importin interaction and nuclear localization signaling.</p><p>The result of two-hybrid analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences present in the JD-containing fragment of ZoCDPK1 are responsible for its interaction with importin-&#x003b1;. The 18-residue bipartite NLS present in the first part of JD is responsible for binding with importin-&#x003b1;. This observation well-correlates with the <italic>in silico</italic> interaction data in which importin clearly interacts with the NLS of ZoCDPK1. Even though the presence of an NLS has been observed in many CDPKs, its functional nature in CDPKs was not studied so far. The present study is the first report regarding the availability of a biologically functional NLS in CDPKs.</p><p>(Raichaudhuri et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) reported that in CDPKs, the NLS in the JD is always coupled with non-consensus Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding EF-hand domains in their CaM-LD. Due to this atypical Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding property, such CDPKs invariably requires an activation trigger like &#x0201c;binding with importin&#x0201d; to their NLS region. Hence they are supposed to be functional only in the nucleus. The kinase activity of these CDPKs on any of the available substrates is not reported so far too (Wu et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). ZoCDPK1 (and many other recently reported CDPKs) also has an NLS sequence in the JD and consensus sequence in the EF-hand domains of CaM-LD. In ZoCDPK1, the NLS is biologically functional too. Moreover, the Importin-ZoCDPK1 complex structure (<italic>in silico</italic> model) shows that importin binding does not interfere with its kinase activity as the kinase and regulatory domains are spatially away from importin. Hence, for ZoCDPK1, the binding of importin is not required for the activation of protein. ZoCDPK1 also showed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity against Histone III-S substrate (unpublished data). Considering all the above factors, it may be possible that ZoCDPK1 also has an activation mechanism similar to that of canonical CDPK.</p></sec><sec><title>ZoCDPK1 interacts with many stress responsive proteins</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid system has been used effectively for the identification of <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates for protein kinases. A mutated MEK1 (Raf phosphorylation sites changed to alanine) was able to interact with Raf (both proteins from HeLa cells) in the yeast two-hybrid system, whereas non-mutant MEK1 was not (Wu et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The mutated phosphorylation site helped to stabilize the interaction. This is presumably due to the formation of a non-productive complex (Wu et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Patel et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The success of this approach depends on the fact that physical interactions between a protein kinase and its protein substrate determine a large portion of its specificity (Smith et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). As CDPKs have been functionally characterized as important regulators involved in plant responses to drought, salt and biotic stresses, identification of targets or substrates become an important task for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of CDPK functions. Increasing evidence for the identification of CDPK substrates supports the notion that CDPKs are multifunctional kinases involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions (Harper and Harmon, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Efforts have been made to identify CDPK-interacting proteins, such as ABF4 for AtCPK32 (Choi et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), AtDi19-1 for CPK11 (Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), StRBOHB for StCDPK5 (Kobayashi et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), ABF1 and ABF4 for AtCPK4 and AtCPK11 (Zhu et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), RSG for NtCDPK1 (Ishida et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and HSP1 for AtCPK10 (Zou et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>ZoCDPK1 is a multiple stress responsive CDPK from ginger and is having predominant nuclear localization during normal and stress conditions. Hence identification of potential interacting partners of this CDPK will lead to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor during stress signal transduction in ginger. In this direction, through yeast hybrid experiment, 10 putative interacting partners (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were identified from stress induced Y2H library of ginger. The functional roles of these proteins are discussed below.</p><sec><title>NAC transcription factor</title><p>NAC (NAM/ATAF1,2/CUC2) transcription factors are one of the largest families of plant specific transcriptional regulators, and members of the NAC gene family have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of the transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant stress responses (Nuruzzaman et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>GATA transcription factor</title><p>They are a family of transcription factors characterized by their ability to bind the DNA sequence &#x0201c;GATA&#x0201d; (Ko and Engel, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).

NAC proteins are plant-specific TFs which have been shown to function in relation to plant development and also for abiotic and/or biotic stress responses. The cDNA encoding a NAC protein was first reported as RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 26 (RD26) gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Nakashima et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Many NAC proteins, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CUC2, have important functions in plant development. Some NAC genes are up-regulated during wounding and bacterial infection (Collinge and Boller, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Hegedus et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), whereas others mediate viral resistance (Xie et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Furthermore, numerous NAC genes are involved in the response of plants to abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and submergence (Nakashima et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>ZoCDPK1 is rapidly induced by high-salt stress, drought, and jasmonic acid treatment but not by low temperature stress or abscissic acid treatment (Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). DRE/CRT/LTRE is a major <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory element in ABA-independent gene expression under abiotic stress conditions (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). There are several drought-inducible genes that do not respond to either cold or ABA treatment, suggesting the existence of other ABA-independent pathways in the dehydration stress response (Agarwal et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The NAC proteins are the prominent candidates in this direction which in cooperation with zinc-finger homeodomain proteins or alone help in transcriptional activation (Agarwal et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It was already reported that ZoCDPK1 functions in the positive regulation of signaling pathways that are involved in the response to salinity and drought stress in ginger and is likely operating in a DRE/CRT independent manner (Vivek et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The interaction between ZoCDPK1 and NAC TF observed in Y2H experiment further confirms the involvement in DRE/CRT independent pathway. Hence ZoCDPK1 is operating through NAC TF mediated ABA-independent, cold non-responsive pathway in ginger.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>PV performed experiments.
