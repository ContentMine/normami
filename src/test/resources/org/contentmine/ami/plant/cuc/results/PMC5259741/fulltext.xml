In this study, we describe the functional characterization of <italic>PtoMYB156</italic>, encoding a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, from <italic>Populus tomentosa.</italic> Expression pattern analysis showed that <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> is widely expressed in all tissues examined, but predominantly in leaves and developing wood cells. PtoMYB156 localized to the nucleus and acted as a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> in poplar repressed phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes, leading to a reduction in the amounts of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds. Transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> also displayed a dramatic decrease in secondary wall thicknesses of xylem fibers and the content of cellulose, lignin and xylose compared with wild-type plants. Transcript accumulation of secondary wall biosynthetic genes was down-regulated by <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> overexpression. Transcriptional activation assays revealed that PtoMYB156 was able to repress the promoter activities of poplar <italic>CESA17, C4H2</italic> and <italic>GT43B.</italic> By contrast, knockout of <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9 in poplar resulted in ectopic deposition of lignin, xylan and cellulose during secondary cell wall formation. Taken together, these results show that PtoMYB156 may repress phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and negatively regulate secondary cell wall formation in poplar.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In plants, phenylpropanoid compounds are a wide range of secondary metabolites including monolignols, flavonoids, stilbenes and various phenolic acids. These natural products are involved in mechanical strength, plant defense and ultraiolet (UV) light protectants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The first three reactions in the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway are catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H; EC 1.14.13.11), and 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL; EC 6.2.1.12), respectively, leading to the synthesis of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl CoA which is a common precursor for the production of many important compounds including monolignols and flavonoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Lignin is a complex organic polymer of monolignols and constitutes one of the major components of the secondary walls of xylem cells and fibres. Secondary cell walls are the primary constituent of fibers and tracheary elements in wood, which is one of the most abundant feedstock resources in the world, and ensure water and nutrient transport and provide plants with rigidity and strength to support their body weight. Secondary wall formation is an ordered developmental process that requires the fine temporal and spatial regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis and targeted secretion of secondary wall components, and oriented deposition and assembly of secondary walls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In the past decade, comprehensive molecular and genetic studies have revealed a complex regulatory network for secondary wall biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>A hierarchical network of transcription factors has been proposed to control secondary wall formation in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Several NAC (for NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors including NST1/2, NST3/SND1, VND6/7 act as master switches that activate secondary wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In woody plants such as poplar and <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, a group of wood-associated NAC transcription factors (PtrWNDs and EgWND1) have been identified as functional orthologs of the Arabidopsis secondary wall biosynthesis-related NACs including SND1, NST1/2, and VND6/7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Besides NAC proteins, several MYB transcription factors were also shown to be key regulators of secondary wall formation. In poplar, at least four MYB transcription factors (PtrMYB2, PtrMYB3, PtrMYB20 and PtrMYB21) have been demonstrated to be direct targets of PtrWNDs and functional orthologs of the Arabidopsis MYB46 and MYB83 which act as second-level master switches controlling secondary wall biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These PtrMYBs are able to activate the promoter activities of poplar wood biosynthetic genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, PtrMYB3/20 were also capable of activating the biosynthetic pathways of secondary cell wall, resulting in ectopic deposition of cellulose, xylan and lignin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Other wood-associated transcription factors as master switches activated secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation include the <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> EgMYB2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and the pine (<italic>Pinus taeda</italic>) PtMYB4/8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These transcription factors have been shown to be functional orthologs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MYB46/83, and overexpression of PtMYB4 and EgMYB2 resulted in ectopic lignification in tobacco and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. There are also many R2R3 MYB transcription factors that directly bind to AC <italic>cis</italic>-elements (AC-I, ACCTACC; AC-II, ACCAACC, and AC-III, ACCTAAC) in lignin biosynthetic gene promoters to positively and negatively regulate lignin synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

We found that AC-like elements are also present in the promoter regions of other structural genes of secondary wall biosynthetic pathway in poplar and promoter activity analysis in transient assays showed that PtoMYB156 repressed the promoters of poplar <italic>PtrC4H2, PtrCEASA17</italic> and <italic>PtrGT43B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, direct evidence for binding of PtoMYB156 protein to the promoters of secondary wall biosynthetic genes is still lacking.</p><p>To further determine the function of PtoMYB156, we created transgenic poplar plants with knockout mutations in <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). As described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, three sgRNA target sites located in the first exon of the <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> gene were chosen as target sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Interestingly, most of the <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> mutant alleles were deletions and insertions at the second and third target sites and no mutation was found in the first target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>), indicating that selection of the optimum target-sites for sgRNA is particularly important for effectively directing gene-specific editing in <italic>Populus</italic>. In our study, a big fragment deletion was also detected in several <italic>PtoMYB156</italic>-<italic>KO</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref> and C). Similar results were found in other plant species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, tomato<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref> and rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. <italic>PtoMYB156-KO</italic> plants showed normal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>), but exhibited a ectopic deposition of lignin in phloem tissues and an increase in secondary wall thickening in xylem cells compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Quantatitive RT-PCR analysis showed that knockout of <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> in poplar resulted in an increase in the transcriptional levels of secondary wall-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7E</xref>). Our results indicated that knockout of <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> in poplar may abolish the direct suppression of <italic>PtoMYB156</italic> in regulating secondary wall biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis, a knockout mutant of <italic>AtMYB4</italic> showed an increase in sinapate esters, resulting in more tolerant to UV-B and transcript level of the gene encoding C4H, which was a major target of AtMYB4, was upregulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The mutation of <italic>AtMYB32</italic>, a transcription factor closely related to <italic>AtMYB4</italic>, resulted in aberrant pollen and male sterility and increased expression of <italic>COMT</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, this study provided the evidence for the biological functions of PtoMYB156 as a negative regulator of phenylpropanoid pathway and secondary wall formation during wood formation in poplar. Combined with this findings in our study and other studies of poplar transcription factors (NAC and MYB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, we propose that secondary wall formation requires fine-tuning spatiotemporal regulation in poplar, and transcription activators or repressors could provide a mechanism to ensure tight regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in vascular tissues of poplar.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Yang, L. <italic>et al</italic>.
