Glutaredoxins react to the level of oxidative potential and can reduce cysteine dithiols, in some cases to activate specific transcription factors. In Arabidopsis, loss of function of the glutaredoxin ROXY1 or the trihelix transcription factor PETAL LOSS (PTL) each results in reduced numbers of petals. Here, genetic studies have revealed that loss of petals in <italic>ptl</italic> mutant plants depends on ROXY1 function. The two genes also act together to restrain stamen-identifying C function from entering the outer whorls. On the other hand, they suppress growth between sepals and in sepal margins, with ROXY1 action partially redundant to that of PTL. Genetic interactions with <italic>aux1</italic> mutations indicate that auxin activity is reduced in the petal whorl of <italic>roxy1</italic> mutants as in <italic>ptl</italic> mutants. However, it is apparently increased in the sepal whorl of triple mutants associated with the ectopic outgrowth of sepal margins, and of finger-like extensions of inter-sepal zones that in 20% of cases are topped with bunches of ectopic sepals. These interactions may be indirect, although PTL and ROXY1 proteins can interact directly when co-expressed in a transient assay. Changes of conserved cysteines within PTL to similar amino acids that cannot be oxidized did not block its function. It may be in some cases that under reducing conditions ROXY1 binds PTL and activates it by reducing specific conserved cysteines, thus resulting in growth suppression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AUX1</kwd><kwd>flower development</kwd><kwd>glutaredoxin</kwd><kwd>petal</kwd><kwd>PETAL LOSS</kwd><kwd>ROXY1</kwd><kwd>sepal</kwd><kwd>trihelix</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Australian Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000923</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">DP0880214</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">DP130100177</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="58"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Meristems are the ultimate source of all plant tissues. Primary meristems are characterized by a core of slowly dividing stem cells surrounded by regions of growth, organogenesis, and eventually cellular differentiation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sablowski, 2010</xref>). In shoot and flower meristems, cell division increases in the peripheral zone surrounding the stem cells, and organ initiation is signaled within this zone at defined times and locations. Specific transcription factors and signal molecules have been uncovered in Arabidopsis that maintain the stem cell population, especially members of the homeodomain WUSCHEL (WUS) family in association with CLAVATA (CLV) signaling molecules (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Schoof et al., 2000</xref>). Another homeodomain transcription factor, SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), maintains the undifferentiated peripheral zone, with its function fading as organ primordia develop (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 1996</xref>), regulated by auxin dynamics (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>). Boundaries between developing organ primordia are reinforced by dampening of cell divisions associated with expression of <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</italic> (<italic>CUC</italic>) genes of the NAC transcription factor family (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aida et al., 1997</xref>). More recent understanding of mechanisms of meristem development has built on these foundation studies (for reviews, see <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">&#x0017d;&#x000e1;dn&#x000ed;kov&#x000e1; and Simon, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hepworth and Pautot, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Galli and Gallivotti, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cell division in subregions of meristems may be correlated with their oxidative state (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rouhier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Schippers et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the quiescent center of root meristems, with low cell division rates, is associated with low oxygen (reducing) conditions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). In this case, glutathione, a tripeptide that functions to modulate the reduced state of thiols in proteins, is required as its disruption by mutation results in loss of the root quiescent center, and stalling of cell division at the G1 to S phase transition (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Vernoux et al., 2000</xref>). Inflorescence and flower meristem development is also moderated by redox status associated with glutathione function (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bashandy et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A key process that may respond to redox conditions is the regulation of transcription factor activity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt and Schippers, 2015</xref>). For example, covalent disulfide bonds between two cysteine residues may need to be reduced for DNA binding to occur. In plants, this has been shown for R2R3 Myb (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Heine et al., 2004</xref>), class 3 HD-ZIP (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Comelli and Gonzalez, 2007</xref>), AP2 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Shaikhali et al., 2008</xref>), TCP (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Viola et al., 2013</xref>), and bZIP (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Shaikhali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gutsche and Zachgo, 2016</xref>) family members. Even so, in most cases whether it also occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> to regulate specific responses to redox conditions has not been established.</p><p>One class of oxidoreductases that catalyze the modification of protein thiol groups dependant on oxygen availability are the glutaredoxins (GRXs) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Str&#x000f6;her and Millar, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>). These have a conserved active site where a key cysteine is directly involved in the reduction of disulfide bonds to unconjugated thiol (SH) groups, usually involving glutathione. In plants, there are three sub-classes of GRXs, defined by their active site. The largest of these have adjacent cysteines and are known as CC GRXs (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>). Their biological functions are being revealed by biochemical and genetic experiments, including responses to oxidative stress and regulation of specific developmental decisions. The first GRX shown to be involved in development was identified through analysis of <italic>roxy1</italic> mutants of Arabidopsis (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2005</xref>). These mutants have reduced numbers of petals, with many of the remaining ones being folded or smaller than normal. There are 21 CC GRX family members in Arabidopsis and they have been named ROXY1-21 depending on their degree of relatedness to ROXY1 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Some ROXY family members interact with bZIP transcription factors of the TGA class (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Despr&#x000e9;s et al., 2003</xref>). For example, ROXY1 and 2 bind to PERIANTHIA (PAN, also named TGA8), TGA9 and TGA10 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in yeast (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). PAN is involved in defining the floral blueprint of the Arabidopsis flower, with five sepals and five petals often present in <italic>pan</italic> mutants instead of the normal four (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Running and Meyerowitz, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al., 1999</xref>). Genetic interactions suggest that ROXY1 negatively regulates PAN&#x02019;s inhibition of petal initiation. Whether this occurs through ROXY1 controlling the redox state of cysteines in PAN has not been established, although recent evidence shows that PAN can bind its specific DNA target <italic>in vitro</italic> only under reducing conditions (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gutsche and Zachgo, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Petal initiation is also disrupted in mutants of the <italic>PETAL LOSS</italic> (<italic>PTL</italic>) gene (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>). PTL encodes a transcription factor of the trihelix family (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>), and its main role in the flower is to repress growth in the sepal whorl rather than in the petal region where it is not expressed. In <italic>ptl</italic> mutants there are some additional cell divisions between sepals, and the sepals themselves are wider and deeper in profile, defects that correlate with the early expression pattern of <italic>PTL</italic> at these two locations (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2012</xref>). The disruption of petal initiation in <italic>ptl</italic> mutants, however, may be indirect and a consequence of growth-induced distortions to auxin accumulation internal to the sepal whorl (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>). We showed this by generating auxin in the inter-sepal zone where PTL is normally expressed, and restoring nearby petal initiation in <italic>ptl</italic> loss-of-function mutants. Also, residual petals that arise in <italic>ptl</italic> single mutant flowers were lost when auxin accumulation into the epidermis, controlled by the auxin influx permease AUXIN1 (AUX1) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 1996</xref>), was jointly compromised. Disruption of polar auxin transport, controlled by PINOID (PID) and PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1), had similar consequences (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we were interested to determine if PTL and ROXY1 functions overlap in floral organogenesis. Mutant and mis-expression approaches revealed that ROXY1 supports the disruption of petal initiation seen in <italic>ptl</italic> mutants. Further, the two proteins act in combination to prevent stamen-identifying C function from moving into the second whorl. By introducing the <italic>aux1</italic> mutant we revealed that ROXY1 and PTL together maintain appropriate auxin activity in the petal initiation zone. On the other hand, mutant defects in the sepal whorl indicated that these are caused by the release of normal growth inhibition, at least partly associated with heightened, not reduced, auxin function. This occurred to such an extent that when PTL, ROXY1, and AUX1 functions were all lost, inter-sepal zones often generated stalked outgrowths capped by clusters of sepals independent of the normal sepals. We further showed that PTL and ROXY1 proteins can bind following transient co-expression, and that three conserved cysteines in PTL can be changed to serine or alanine (and thus incapable of forming cysteine bridges) without losing petal initiation function. This is consistent with PTL acting when the cysteines are in a reduced state, although whether this is controlled by ROXY1 requires further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Origin of Arabidopsis Mutant Lines and Scoring of Flowers</title><p>The <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant, in Columbia background (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>), is a null mutation encoding a premature stop at codon 120 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>ptl-3</italic> mutant in Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic>, used in one experiment, carries a 100 bp deletion from codon 216 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>roxy1-3</italic> null mutant, in Columbia, has a T-DNA insertion in the coding region (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2005</xref>), and was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Center (ABRC) (CS328164; GABI-Kat GK-268A11.01). The <italic>aux1-7</italic> and <italic>aux1-21</italic> mutants, also in Columbia, were sourced from ABRC (CS3074, CS9584). <italic>aux1-21</italic> is a null mutation carrying an X-ray-induced deletion of one nucleotide leading to a premature stop at codon 279, and <italic>aux1-7</italic> is a partial loss of function point mutation (G459D) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Swarup et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Multiple mutants were generated by inter-crossing single or double mutant plants, and required homozygous individuals identified in the resulting F2 families by PCR analysis (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>). F3 progeny plants of relevant genotypes were grown together, either at 20&#x000b0;C with 16 h of Cool White fluorescent light, or in a glasshouse at &#x0223c;20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C, with natural daylight supplemented by continuous fluorescent light. The first 10 flowers of the primary inflorescences of seven or eight F3 plants were scored for each genotype, with the number and form of organs in all four whorls recorded. Comparisons of petal numbers were based solely on plants grown together as this phenotype in <italic>ptl</italic> mutant plants is sensitive to environmental conditions, especially temperature (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>). In some cases, siliques were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) directly without fixation using a Quanta FEG 200 ESEM, or using either a Hitachi s570 microscope following glutaraldehyde fixation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Modification of Intra-cellular Localization (MILo) Procedure</title><p>To test if the PTL and ROXY1 proteins can associate, the MILo method was used (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). To generate 35S:YFP-ROXY1 and 35S:YFP-ROXY1&#x00394;C129 (a C-terminal deletion of eight codons), ROXY1 coding sequence was amplified from genomic DNA (<italic>ROXY1</italic> is intron-free) (see <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold> for primers) and cloned behind YFP coding sequences that had been inserted in pART7 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). The construction of 35S:CFPN7-PTL, in which mCerulean (CFP) was translationally fused with the strong nuclear-localization sequence N7, has been described (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). In the converse arrangement, cytoplasmic 35S:YFP-PTLmNLS (with mutant nuclear localization sequences) was from <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al. (2014)</xref>, and nuclear 35S:CFPN7-ROXY1 was constructed by inserting the amplified ROXY1 genomic sequence into pART7 already containing CFPN7 downstream of the 35S promoter. The expression cassettes were excised with <italic>Not</italic>I, inserted into pMLBART and the plasmids electroporated into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain AGL1.</p><p>Cultures of the two components were mixed and inoculated into maturing leaves of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> in duplicate (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). After 3&#x02013;4 days the inoculated sectors were cut out, mounted in water, and the lower surface visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot 2 mot plus microscope, with images collected using AxioVision software. YFP fluorescence was observed using filter set 46 (excitation BP500-20; beam splitter FT515; emission BP535/30), and CFP with filter set 4 (excitation BP470-20; beam splitter FT495; emission BP505-530). YFP fluorescence showed no overlap with CFP fluorescence and was used to assess protein-protein interactions. All MILo experiments were repeated on three or more occasions, and always included controls of each construct inoculated alone, and combinations in which the 35S:CFPN7 construct lacked the translationally fused &#x0201c;bait&#x0201d; protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of Constructs and Transgenic Plants, and Complementation Tests</title><p>To test the functions of ROXY1 or PTL in petal initiation, each was expressed in mutant plants under the control of the PTL promoter region, pPTL(1.3i) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2012</xref>). This included 1.3 kbp upstream of the transcription start site, the 5&#x02032; UTR, the first exon and intron, and eight codons of the second exon. This can fully complement <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant plants when driving expression of full-length PTL (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The promoter was attached to a cassette containing a GUS reporter flanked by the self-cleavage peptide sequence T2A to release the GUS protein [pPTL(1.3i):2A-GUS-2A] (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). The gene to be tested, either ROXY1 or PTL (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>) was then translationally fused to this and inserted in pMIGRO (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>), a derivative of pBJ36 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gleave, 1992</xref>). The cassettes were excised by <italic>Not</italic>I and inserted in pMLBART as above. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteines in the PTL protein was performed using a two-step PCR procedure with two divergent primers encoding the required substitution (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mutant plants were transformed and transgenic T1 plants selected by Basta resistance.

Twelve to fifteen T1 plants chosen at random for each construct and scored for complementation of second whorl organ number in the first 10 flowers of the main inflorescence. If there was no complementation, five or more plants were stained for GUS product (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>) to confirm expression of the pPTL(1.3i):2A-GUS-2A cassette. All comparisons between constructs within an experiment were grown and scored together (see above).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ROXY1 Promotes the Reduction in Petal Initiation that Occurs in <italic>ptl</italic> Mutant Flowers</title><p>Loss of either PTL or ROXY1 function results in fewer second whorl organs being formed (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2005</xref>), although the disruption is weaker in <italic>roxy1</italic> mutants.

This may be the result of auxin accumulation in the tissues underlying the epidermis, thus promoting additional organ growth already sensitized by the loss of PTL and ROXY1 functions.</p><p>In whorl 2, <italic>roxy1 aux1</italic> double mutants lost additional second whorl primordia, suggesting that auxin signaling is also affected in <italic>roxy1</italic> single mutants as we have previously shown for <italic>ptl</italic> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, in <italic>ptl roxy1 aux1</italic> triple mutants the further loss of AUX1 function did not have a major second whorl effect as organ numbers were maintained at the <italic>ptl roxy1</italic> level. It seems that when both PTL and ROXY1 functions are compromised there is sufficient auxin signal in whorl 2 to support most organ initiation, whether or not there is movement of auxin into the epidermis by AUX1. The area occupied by whorl 2 in <italic>ptl roxy1</italic> double mutants is increased (at least in mature flowers), so perhaps there is a larger region capable of petal initiation in stage 4 buds.</p><p>Thus in the wild type the three proteins PTL, ROXY1, and AUX1 may limit auxin function in the first whorl between and within sepal primordia, keeping growth in check. Conversely, they may promote auxin function in the second whorl supporting the initiation of petal primordia. These roles may be associated with the proposed temporal movement of auxin from the first to the second whorl during early flower development (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>). AUX1 is not involved in such lateral auxin transport, but the polar auxin transport proteins PIN1 and PID are, and each promotes petal initiation (presumably through auxin accumulation) in the second whorl (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It should be emphasized that the involvement of auxin revealed here could be the secondary consequence of growth disruptions that result from the loss of PTL or ROXY1 functions. At this stage there is no evidence that genes controlling auxin biosynthesis, transport or signaling are the direct targets of PTL regulation, or that such proteins are subject to disulphide reduction or deglutathionylation by ROXY1, and future tests of such events are required.</p></sec><sec><title>C Function Is Jointly Repressed by PTL and ROXY1 in the Outer Whorls</title><p>The identity of second whorl organs was often modified in <italic>ptl-1 roxy1-3</italic> double mutant flowers. More than one third were now stamens or stamenoid petals, implying extension of AGAMOUS (AG)-directed C function outward into the second whorl (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). Ectopic carpelloid outgrowths also occurred on sepal margins in &#x0223c;5% of flowers indicating C function activity in the first whorl as well. In both whorls the effects were magnified upon loss of AUX1 function.</p><p>Similar ectopic extension of C function was also seen when <italic>roxy1</italic> mutants were combined with other mutations (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2005</xref>), including mutations of the zinc finger repressor gene <italic>RABBIT EARS</italic> (<italic>RBE</italic>). Loss of RBE function alone resulted in loss of some petals (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Takeda et al., 2004</xref>), and also some AG mis-expression and organ identity defects (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Krizek et al., 2006</xref>), and these disruptions were enhanced when RBE and ROXY1 function were conjointly compromised (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2005</xref>). PTL may act in a common developmental pathway with RBE as their loss of function phenotypes overlap, and there is no further loss of second whorl organs in <italic>ptl-1 rbe-3</italic> double mutant flowers (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2013</xref>). Their responses to disruptions in auxin dynamics are also similar.</p><p>The mechanistic basis of this ectopic C function is not clear, although disruptions to boundaries in the floral meristem may be involved. RBE is involved in organ boundary specification as it directly represses expression of <italic>EXTRA EARLY PETALS1</italic> (<italic>EEP1</italic>), a microRNA that negatively regulates two <italic>CUC</italic> boundary genes <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Mutants of <italic>ptl</italic> also interact genetically with <italic>eep1</italic> and <italic>cuc1</italic> mutants in the outer whorls (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lampugnani et al., 2012</xref>), although PTL is a transcriptional activator not a repressor (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>), and its direct targets have not been established.</p><p>Interestingly, PAN, a partner of ROXY1, binds to a regulatory element in the intron of <italic>AG</italic> and promotes its expression (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Maier et al., 2009</xref>). Further, such binding occurs <italic>in vitro</italic> only under reducing conditions (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gutsche and Zachgo, 2016</xref>). However, direct regulation of <italic>AG</italic> expression by PAN is likely to be limited to the fourth whorl (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2009</xref>), imposing determinacy at the center of the floral meristem (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Maier et al., 2009</xref>), and thus independent of repression of <italic>AG</italic> in the second whorl.</p></sec><sec><title>Inter-sepal Boundary Zones Retain Meristematic Potential</title><p>One striking finding was that ectopic outward growth from inter-sepal zones occurred when PTL, ROXY1, and AUX1 function were simultaneously lost. Presumably such growth is normally suppressed to maintain inter-organ space and organ separation. Here, we have shown that these boundary regions retain their ability to grow outward, and even to generate stalked structures and aggregates of sepal-like organs. It may be that such organ clusters represent a partial triggering of the flower development program, and it will be informative to test if expression of flower identity genes <italic>LEAFY</italic> and <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1993</xref>) is ectopically induced in this region. Loss of AUX1 function might promote such outgrowths by allowing auxin to accumulate sub-epidermally, where it might trigger or promote meristematic growth. This could also be tested, in this case using reporters of auxin function. The inter-sepal zone may be a region of low oxygen concentration that ROXY1 somehow reacts to and supports the growth-repressing function of PTL. PTL also binds the low energy-sensing kinase AKIN10 component of SnRK1 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Brien et al., 2015</xref>), and the combined action of ROXY1 and AKIN10 might reinforce growth suppression through their independent activation of PTL in hypoxic regions with low energy levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical Interaction of PTL and ROXY1 Proteins</title><p>As well as interacting genetically, PTL and ROXY1 proteins can bind when transiently co-expressed in leaves. This needs to be examined by additional methods such as co-immunoprecipitation tests <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in yeast expression systems, but if confirmed, how might a direct interaction occur in developing buds? Clearly the two proteins need to be present in the same cell. However, their gene expression patterns at stages 3 and 4 do not overlap directly. <italic>PTL</italic> is expressed in inter-sepal zones from stage 3 and in sepal margins from stages 4&#x02013;5, whereas <italic>ROXY1</italic> is expressed in organ anlagen and in the tips of newly arising organs (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>). There is no evidence that PTL mRNA or protein moves between cells, and accumulation of pROXY1:ROXY1-GFP fusion protein matches the sites of accumulation of ROXY1 mRNA (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that it does not move. Even so, ROXY1 is a relatively small 14.2 kDa protein that may be able to move between cells without the GFP tag. Also PTL may be a long-lived protein that continues to occupy the petal initiation region derived from the earlier strong PTL expression domain at stage 3. This could be tested using PTL tagged with long-lived fluorescent timers for example (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Subach et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>PETAL LOSS is nuclear localized (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>), but ROXY1 occurs variably in both nucleus and cytoplasm, although its petal functions depend on its presence in the nucleus (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we showed that ROXY1 occurred preferentially in the nucleus following its association with PTL in transient expression assays. This is consistent with their physical association having functional significance, although this will require further experimental testing.</p><p>ROXY1 interacts with TGA transcription factors at its C-terminal region. Deletion of the eight C-terminal amino acids of ROXY1 disrupts binding to PAN and other TGA transcription factors (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). The deletion apparently disrupts an &#x003b1;-helical region that extends into the adjacent conserved motif LXXLL which provides the specificity needed for the ROXY1&#x02013;PAN interaction and is essential for ROXY function (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The 8-residue deletion includes the ALWL motif at the very C-terminus of ROXY1 also required for its petal development function but not TGA interaction (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, we found that deletion of these eight amino acids of ROXY1 did not affect PTL binding (although it did boost the amount of ROXY1 occurring in the nucleus). The active site of ROXY1 lies internal to this region, so conceivably it could modify the thiol groups of both PAN and PTL, although the ROXY1 domains that bind them may differ. Alternatively, different accessory proteins may be involved.</p></sec><sec><title>PTL As a Potential Target for ROXY1 Reduction</title><p>If PTL is a target of ROXY1, it may be active only if specific cysteine residues are in the reduced state. Each of the duplicated DNA binding domains of PTL has a cysteine at a position conserved throughout trihelix proteins (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nagano, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). We changed these to alanine or serine to chemically mimic the reduced state of cysteine, and found that the PTL protein was still functional. There was no detectable effect when either or both cysteines were replaced by alanine, a slightly smaller but still hydrophobic amino acid. When changed to serine, similar in size to cysteine but more hydrophilic, a change in the N-terminal trihelix also had no major effect but a C-terminal change resulted in a significant reduction, although not full loss, of function.</p><p>The trihelix DNA binding domain is distantly related to that of MYBs, and conserved cysteines occur at equivalent positions (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nagano, 2000</xref>). Our findings match those in c-Myb of humans where mutation of the conserved cysteine to alanine in the R2 repeat did not affect DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, or its function <italic>in vivo</italic>, but a change to serine decreased both (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Myrset et al., 1993</xref>). In c-Myb this region undergoes a conformational change when it binds DNA, with the cysteine now present internally, and folding is apparently blocked if the cysteine is changed to serine but not alanine. Similar differential disruptions to DNA binding have been reported for cysteine substitutions in the P1 Myb of maize (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Heine et al., 2004</xref>). The same might be the case in PTL, as the solution structure of a trihelix relative GT-2 indicates that the conserved cysteine occupies a similar internal position (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>). Why substitution in the N-terminal trihelix of PTL does not significantly reduce function is not known, although the two trihelix domains are relatively divergent (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2014</xref>). Conserved cysteine 565 in the PTL activation domain was also tested and could be changed to either alanine or serine without impacting on its petal initiation role. Overall, our results are consistent with PTL functioning when the three conserved cysteines are in the reduced state, although biochemical studies are needed to further test this, and to determine if their oxidation blocks PTL function.</p></sec><sec><title>Wider Developmental Roles of ROXY Glutaredoxins and Trihelix Transcription Factors</title><p>In addition to petal initiation and growth, developmental functions of ROXY GRXs include control of sporogenous cell identity in anthers of Arabidopsis (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xing and Zachgo, 2008</xref>), rice (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Murmu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2012</xref>), and maize (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kelliher and Walbot, 2012</xref>). In Arabidopsis, <italic>ROXY1</italic> functions redundantly in this with its close paralog <italic>ROXY2</italic> (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xing and Zachgo, 2008</xref>) and it will be interesting to see if the two genes also act redundantly in perianth development.</p><p>Recently, it has been revealed that the maize <italic>Male sterile converted anther</italic> (<italic>Msca1</italic>) GRX gene is also involved in supporting the size of the shoot apical meristem (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). It does this by negatively regulating the size-restraining influence of Fasciated ear4 (Fea4) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Paulter et al., 2015</xref>). Fea4 is the maize ortholog of PAN of Arabidopsis, so a functional relationship between specific ROXY and TGA proteins extends to the shoot as well as the flower meristem. This is consistent with evidence that PAN can influence organ numbers in flowers by restricting the size of the flower meristem (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Maier et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>There are 30 trihelix genes in Arabidopsis, and their functions have diversified to include regulation of developmental processes, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan-Levy et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, they parallel the diversity of developmental and stress-related functions seen among members of the ROXY clade (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>). ROXY functional variation is also matched by division of labor among those TGA transcription factors that interact specifically with each functional group. ROXY1 and PTL are both involved in perianth development, and it will be of interest to test if other trihelix proteins interact with different members of the ROXY family in a parallel, functionally related pattern.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>TQ conceived the study, performed all experiments except SEM, interpreted the results, and prepared drafts of the manuscript.
