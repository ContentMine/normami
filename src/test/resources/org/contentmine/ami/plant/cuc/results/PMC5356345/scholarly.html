Abstract</div> <p>Persimmon fruits accumulate a large amount of proanthocyanidins (PAs) during development. PAs cause a dry or puckering sensation due to its astringency. Pollination constant and non-astringent (PCNA) persimmon fruits can lose astringency during fruit ripening. However, little is known about the mechanism of natural de-astringency of Chinese PCNA (CPCNA). To gain insight into the molecular events of CPCNA natural de-astringency, we used mRNA-seq and iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis to measure changes in genes and proteins expression at two key stages of natural astringency removal (i.e. 10 and 20 weeks after bloom) and water-treated (i.e. 40 °C·12 h) de-astringency fruits. Our analyses show that the three predominantly process in CPCNA de-astringency: (1) water treatment strongly up-regulates glycolysis/acetaldehyde metabolism, (2) expression of genes/proteins involved in PA biosynthetic pathway was remarkably reduced in natural and water-treated de-astringency, (3) sugar metabolism and ethylene related pathway were quite abundant in natural de-astringency. We also found ethylene-related TFs were quite abundant in natural de-astringency, followed by <i>WRKY</i> and <i>NAC</i> transcription factors. These results provide an initial understanding of the predominantly biological processes underlying the natural de-astringency and "coagulation effect" in CPCNA. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <p>Persimmon ( <i>Diospyros kaki</i> Thunb.; 2n = 6x = 90) originated in China and has been widely cultivated in Eastern Asia <a href="#b1">1</a>. Most persimmon fruits accumulate large amounts of high-molecular-weight proanthocyanidins (PAs) in special compartment cells called "tannin cells" that cause a strong astringency sensation in fresh fruits; therefore, these fruits are inedible without artificial treatment to remove the astringency <a href="#b2">2</a>. There is a spontaneous mutant phenotype whose fruits naturally lose their astringency on the tree <a href="#b1">1</a>, these fruits are edible without any artificial treatment after harvest. This non-astringent mutant phenotype, also called pollination constant and non-astringent (PCNA), includes Japanese PCNA (JPCNA) and Chinese PCNA (CPCNA). The genetic difference of the natural de-astringency trait between CPCNA and JPCNA is a single dominant locus controlling in the former genotype but recessive in the latter one <a href="#b3">3</a> <a href="#b4">4</a>. </p> <p>PAs, also called condensed tannins, are plant secondary metabolites that are synthesized via the shikimate and flavonoid pathway <a href="#b5">5</a> <a href="#b6">6</a>. The genetics and biochemistry of the flavonoid pathway have been characterized in several plant species <a href="#b7">7</a> <a href="#b8">8</a> <a href="#b9">9</a>. Most of the enzymatic structural genes involved in PA biosynthesis, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ( <i>PAL</i>), chalcone synthase ( <i>CHS</i>), chalcone isomerase ( <i>CHI</i>), flavanone-3-hydroxylase ( <i>F3H</i>), flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase ( <i>F3</i>′ <i>5</i>′ <i>H</i>), dihydroflavonol 4 reductase ( <i>DFR</i>), anthocyanidin synthase ( <i>ANS</i>), leucoanthocyanidin reductase ( <i>LAR</i>), and anthocyanidin reductase ( <i>ANR</i>), have been isolated <a href="#b10">10</a> <a href="#b11">11</a> <a href="#b12">12</a>. Other genes involved in PA accumulation have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, such as <i>TT12</i> encoding a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family transporter (MATE) <a href="#b13">13</a>, <i>TT19</i> encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) <a href="#b14">14</a>, and autoinhibited H <sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 10, which is required to transport PAs to the vacuole <a href="#b15">15</a>. <i>DkLAC1</i>, a <i>Laccase</i> gene isolated from CPCNA, is phylogenetically related to TT10/AtLAC15, which is potentially involved in the polymerization of PAs monomers in persimmon fruit <a href="#b16">16</a>. </p> <p>Soluble tannins cause astringency in persimmon <a href="#b2">2</a>. Acetaldehyde was found to accumulate significantly in the flesh following the treatment of fruits with warm water <a href="#b17">17</a>, ethanol <a href="#b18">18</a> or CO <sub>2</sub> <a href="#b19">19</a> <a href="#b20">20</a> <a href="#b21">21</a>, and acetaldehyde reacts with soluble tannins to form an insoluble gel, causing the fruits to lose their astringency <a href="#b22">22</a> <a href="#b23">23</a> <a href="#b24">24</a>. In addition, astringency removal in soft persimmon is mainly caused by the accumulation of water-soluble pectin <a href="#b25">25</a>. In plants, acetaldehyde can be synthesized from pyruvate and ethanol, catalyzed by Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), respectively <a href="#b26">26</a> <a href="#b27">27</a> <a href="#b28">28</a>. Recently, eight <i>DkADH</i> and <i>DkPDC</i> genes were isolated from persimmon fruits, and <i>DkADH1 and DkPDC2,</i> have been suggested to be key genes involved in persimmon astringency removal <a href="#b29">29</a> <a href="#b30">30</a>. And six <i>DkPK</i> genes were isolated, which is a key enzyme that catalyzes pyruvate synthesis from phosphoenolpyruvate, and suggested that <i>DkPK1</i> plays a potential role involved in CPCNA natural de-astringency <a href="#b31">31</a>. In addition, several hypoxia-responsive <i>ERF</i> transcriptional regulator genes were also isolated and characterized <a href="#b29">29</a> <a href="#b32">32</a> <a href="#b33">33</a>, in which <i>DKERF9, DkERF10, DkERF19</i>, and <i>DkERF22</i> activated the promoters of <i>DkPDC2, DkADH1</i>, and <i>DkPDC3</i> under high CO <sub>2</sub> (95%) treated de-astringency <a href="#b29">29</a> <a href="#b33">33</a>. A previous study suggested that the "dilution effect" resulted in natural astringency removal in JPCNA <a href="#b34">34</a>, but this effect was not enough to cause CPCNA fruits to lose astringency; there may be a "coagulation effect" in which soluble tannins converted to insoluble during late stage of CPCNA fruit development <a href="#b30">30</a> <a href="#b31">31</a>, but the molecular event underlying CPCNA fruits de-astringency was not so clear. </p> <p>Recently, a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of ‘Luotian-tianshi’ persimmon, a CPCNA fruit treated with ethanol to eliminate its astringency at 10 weeks after bloom (WAB), provided important insight into the process of de-astringency <a href="#b35">35</a>. However, the molecular events and primary course of metabolism in natural de-astringency and the relationship between natural and artificial de-astringency are largely unknown. In this study, fruits at the key stages of natural astringency removal (i.e. 10 and 20 WAB) and water-treated no-astringent fruits were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. These transcriptomic and proteomic data were then used to investigate the genes/proteins expression patterns in two different de-astringency processes and to identify statistically robust GO categories and the underlying genes associated with natural astringency removal. </p> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

PA accumulation patterns between CPCNA, JPCNA and non-PCNA types</div> <p>To examine the PA accumulation patterns in CPCNA fruits, three cultivars, ‘Eshi 1′ (CPCNA), ‘Youhou’ (JPCNA) and ‘Mopanshi’ (non-PCNA), were used for PA seasonal change determination ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>). The imprinting method was performed to approximately measure the soluble tannin content in persimmon fruits. It was deeply stained at 2.5 WAB and gradually lightened with fruit development ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>). The stain was lightly at 10 WAB in ‘Youhou’ and later in ‘Eshi 1’ (i.e. 20 WAB), while the ‘Mopanshi’ was darkly stained even at 25 WAB ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>). </p> <p>To confirm the imprinting results, the soluble and insoluble tannin contents were quantified by the Folin-Ciocalteu method <a href="#b36">36</a>. The same trend of soluble tannin concentration change was shown using two measurements ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1B,C</a>). Previous reports indicated that the soluble tannin concentration is reduced significantly in PCNA type compared to that in non-PCNA during the early stage of fruit development <a href="#b10">10</a> <a href="#b12">12</a>. This same tendency was confirmed in JPCNA ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>); the soluble tannin concentration was obviously reduced after 2.5 WAB. The soluble tannin concentration of JPCNA ‘Youhou’ decreased to 0.2% at 10 WAB, indicating that the fruits at this point had already lost their astringency <a href="#b2">2</a>. Meanwhile, the soluble tannin concentration was maintained at a high level at the same stage in CPCNA and non-PCNA. In addition, the insoluble tannin concentration showed a slight increase in CPCNA after 10 WAB, but no significant change was observed in JPCNA and non-PCNA ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>). </p> </div> <div class="theinsolubletanningcontentsharplyincreasedwhilesolubletannindecreasedafterwatertreatment" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
The insoluble tanning content sharply increased while soluble tannin decreased after water treatment </div> <p>To examine the tannin variation and gene expression changes during artificial de-astringency, the ‘Eshi 1′ (CPCNA) fruits sampled at 10 WAB were then treated with water (25 and 40 °C) to remove their astringency. We found that both 25 and 40 °C water can remove fruits astringency, but the fruits undergoing 25 and 40 °C air cannot eliminate their astringency ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1D</a>). The soluble tannin was sharply decreased after 12 h treatment, company with insoluble tannin increased of fruits treated with 40 °C water, after 48 h treatment fruits undergoing 25 °C water also lost their astringency ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1D</a>). This results confirmed that the soluble tannin was insolubilized after water treatment, heat treatment just accelerate fruits astringency removal but not the main factor for fruits astringency lose. </p> </div> <div class="denovoassemblyandannotationofcpcnapersimmontranscriptome" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"> <i>De novo</i> assembly and annotation of CPCNA persimmon transcriptome </div> <p>To uncover the biological processes underlying the natural and water-treated de-astringency in CPCNA persimmon fruits, we performed whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing over development stages for CPCNA and water treatment. We chose to sample at 10 and 20 WAB in order to capture most of the transcriptional changes, based on the significant change in the PA concentration in CPCNA compared to that in JPCNA and non-PCNA from 10 to 20 WAB. To investigate the differentially expressed genes underlying water treatment, the fruits treated after 12 h with 40 °C water and 25 °C air were also selected for RNA-seq. The correlation matrix shows that the three replicates for each treatment cluster together ( <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</a>). The 12 samples produced about 352.8 million paired-end reads, averaging 29.4 million reads per sample ( <a href="#S1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). Filtered and trimmed reads are available via the NCBI Short Read Archive.

Only a few top hits were from <i>Camelia sinensis</i>, which also accumulates various polyphenolic compounds <a href="#b38">38</a>. </p> <p>Among the 86,784 unigenes with at least one GO term assigned, 73,178 unigenes (53.8% of All-unigenes), 54,473 unigenes (40.1% of All-unigenes), and 18,500 unigenes (13.6% of All-unigenes) were assigned to the biological process (GO:0008150), cellular component (GO:0005575), and molecular function (GO:0003674) categories, respectively ( <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S1</a>). The overall distribution and multilevel GO distribution within these broad GO categories are shown in <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2B</a>.

By incorporating control sample (10 A), we were able to identify deastringency-related genes against this background of fluctuating gene expression. However, it is likely that the expression level of some genes reflects both the effect of water treatment and changes in background expression. </p> </div> <div class="keggpathwayandgeneontologyenrichmentanalysissuggestsde-astringencynaturallyorwithwatertreatmentrelatedpathway" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The differentially expressed genes were divided into two subsets, one containing genes that up-regulated and the other containing down-regulated genes, and both subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and semantic clustering. Among the significantly enriched GO terms found for the set of up-regulated genes, terms related to sugar metabolism (i.e. raffinose catabolic process and cellular glucan metabolic process), fruit color related pathway (carotene biosynthetic process and carotenoid biosynthetic process), signal transduction pathway (signal transduction by phosphorylation, abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway, and ethylene-activated signaling pathway) ( <a href="#f3">Fig. 3C</a> and <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S6</a>).

Water treatment strongly up-regulates glycolysis/acetaldehyde metabolism in persimmon fruits </div> <p>Both the KEGG pathways and GO enrichment results suggested that glycolysis process and pyruvate biosynthesis is significantly enriched in underlying water-treated fruits ( <a href="#f3">Fig. 3B,E</a> and <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S8</a>). By mapping genes to pyruvate metabolism pathways, a total of 268 unigenes were found ( <a href="#t1">Table 1</a>), of which 69 differentially expressed, and 57 of them up-regulated, only 12 were down-regulated.

Expression of genes involved in PA biosynthetic pathway was highly reduced in natural and water-treated de-astringency </div> <p>Many of GO terms of down-regulated genes in natural and water-treated de-astringency were related to the flavonoid biosynthesis ( <a href="#f3">Fig. 3D,F</a> and <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S7</a>, <a href="#S1">9</a>). Expression of four steps of PA biosynthetic pathway (i.e. shikimate pathway, phenylpropane pathway, core flavonoid pathway, and proanthocyanidins special pathway) genes indicated most of them were down-regulated ( <a href="#t2">Table 2</a> and <a href="#f6">Fig. 6A</a>). In the shikimate biosynthetic genes, namely, <i>DHQS, DHD, SK, CS</i> was reduced (i.e. 3- to 11-fold) in natural de-astringency, while two <i>SK-like</i> and one <i>CS-like</i> unigenes increased after water treatment. The genes expression of early flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, including, <i>C4H, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3</i>′ <i>H</i>, and <i>F3</i>′ <i>5</i>′ <i>H</i> was considerably reduced (i.e. 2- to 14-fold). And some late flavonoid biosynthetic genes were also down-regulated in both natural and water-treated de-astringency. These belong to both the flavonol biosynthetic branch and the proanthocyanidin biosynthetic branch. However, <i>Flavonol synthase (FLS-like</i>) gene that specific for flavonol biosynthetic was not differentially expressed in natural de-astringecy ( <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset 2</a>). The specific for proanthocyanidin biosynthetic pathway genes, namely, <i>DFR, ANS, ANR, MATE</i>, and <i>LAC</i> were highly reduced (i.e. 2- to 45-fold). This results suggested that PA biosynthetic pathway genes were specific down-regulated during natural de-astringency. </p> <p>Next, we performed a targeted analysis of PA biosynthesis pathway-related genes, that were significantly down-regulated (FC &amp;lt; 0.2, FDR &amp;lt; 0.001) in 10 W-vs-20 W and examined their expression levels in three cultivars ‘Eshi 1′, ‘Youhou’, and ‘Mopanshi’. A total of 11 unigenes were selected for qRT-PCR analysis ( <a href="#f6">Fig. 6B</a>). The expression levels of the 11 genes (i.e. <i>Unigene39486_All, Unigene24632_All, Unigene1955_All, CL3714.Contig4_All, Unigene10342_All, Unigene30211_All, Unigene_13648_All, CL2365.Contig2_All, Unigene5625_All, CL11743.Contig1_All, </i> and <i>CL3961.Contig1_All</i>) that are annotated as <i>PAL, C4H, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3</i>′ <i>5</i>′ <i>H, ANR, ANS, MATE</i>, and <i>LAC</i>, respectively. These genes encode enzymes of the PA biosynthesis pathway. The expression of most genes ( <i>PAL, C4H, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3</i>′ <i>5 H</i>′, <i>ANR, ANS</i>, and <i>MATE</i>) was synchronously down-regulated from 2.5 WAB and was almost below the detection limit after 10 WAB in JPCNA and after 15 WAB in CPCNA ( <a href="#f6">Fig. 6B</a>). The relative expression level in non-PCNA was higher than that in CPCNA, followed by JPCNA. The expression of <i>LAC_CL3961.Contig1_All</i> was up-regulated in the non-PCNA type after 5 WAB ( <a href="#f6">Fig. 6B</a>), consistent with the function of <i>LAC</i> genes, which might participate in PA oligomerization/polymerization. Thus, the expression levels of these PA biosynthesis-related genes correspond to the tannin accumulation pattern of these three cultivars, in that the termination of tannin accumulation occurs earlier in JPCNA (10 WAB) and later in CPCNA (20 WAB). However, this accumulation sustainably increases in non-PCNA until fruit ripening ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>). </p> </div> <div class="proteomicanalysisofdifferentiallyexpressedproteins(deps)inpersimmonfruitsundergoingde-astringencynaturallyorwithwatertreatment" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Discussion</div> <p>Because persimmon being a perennial and hexaploid, limited information is available on the molecular mechanism underlying the fruit (de)astringency of CPCNA persimmon. Here, we reported a comprehensive transcriptome and proteome study to characterize the gene/protein expression profiles of natural and water-treated de-astringency in CPCNA fruit. We identified differentially expressed genes and proteins, and characterized the functional characteristics of DEGs and DEPs in two processes of astringency removal that could be further exploited to help understanding the molecular events during CPCNA natural astringency removal. </p> <p>Previous reports demonstrated that soluble tannin concentration was markedly reduced in the PCNA type compared with the non-PCNA type at an early stage of fruit development <a href="#b10">10</a> <a href="#b12">12</a> <a href="#b39">39</a>. In this study, we found the astringency removal in CPCNA is in the late stage of fruit development (i.e. after 20 WAB), which is far than in JPCNA (i.e. 10 WAB), however the soluble tannin in non-PCNA ‘Mopanshi’ maintain high level until full ripening (i.e. 25 WAB). The PA biosynthetic pathway was severely blocked in late stage of fruit development. Many of GO terms of down-regulated genes and proteins in natural de-astringency were related to the PA biosynthesis-related pathway ( <a href="#f3">Fig. 3D</a> and <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S7</a>). Expression of genes related to PA biosynthetic, names, <i>DHQS, DHD, SK, C4H, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3</i>′ <i>H, F3</i>′ <i>5</i>′ <i>H, DFR, ANS</i>, and <i>ANR</i> showed highly reduced ( <a href="#f6">Fig. 6A</a>) and genes corresponding proteins were also down-regulated ( <a href="#t3">Table 3</a>). However, we found <i>Glutathione S-transferase-like (GST-like</i>) gene was up-regulated both in natural and water-treated de-astringency. In <i>Arabidopsis, TT19</i> encoding GST transporter is involved in the accumulation of both anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins <a href="#b14">14</a>, however, the primary function of GSTs is generally considered to be the detoxification of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds <a href="#b40">40</a> <a href="#b41">41</a> <a href="#b42">42</a>. In a variety of plants, specific GSTs are reported to be induced upon infection, in response to treatment with heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, plant hormones, dehydration, wounding and senescence <a href="#b40">40</a>. Thus, the up-regulated <i>GST-like</i> genes in this experiment might response to heat stress (i.e. 40 °C water treatment) or biotic and abiotic stress (i.e. plant hormones). Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR to validate the expression of 11 key structural genes in the three cultivars ( <a href="#f6">Fig. 6B</a>). The expression of most of these genes, except for that of <i>LAC_CL3961.Contig1_All</i>, was simultaneously down-regulated from 2.5 WAB and was almost below the detection limit after 10 WAB in JPCNA and after 15 WAB in CPCNA and non-PCNA, but the average expression levels of these genes were approximately 2- and 11-fold higher in non-PCNA than in CPCNA and JPCNA at 10 WAB, respectively. The PCNA-type-specific down-regulated PA pathway genes coincided with the reduced PA amount in PCNA type ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>). Expression of most of genes (i.e. <i>DkPAL, DkCHS, DkCHI, DkF3H, DkF3</i>′ <i>5</i>′ <i>H, DkDFR, DkANS</i>, and <i>DkANR</i>) involved in PA biosynthetic pathway was synchronously down-regulated from 5 WAB and was almost below the detection limit after 7 WAB in JPCNA <a href="#b39">39</a>. And the expression of genes ( <i>PAL, CHS, F3H, DFR, and ANR</i>) was continuous in the CPCNA, despite the termination of tannin cell development (i.e. 10 WAB) <a href="#b4">4</a>. This results was consistent with the PA accumulation pattern in three types of persimmon ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>), and also proved that the astringency removal naturally in CPCNA is different from JPCNA, the "dilution effect" for JPCNA natural de-astringency <a href="#b34">34</a> was not adequate to cause CPCNA persimmon fruits to loss its astringency. It is very interesting that decrease slope rate of the insoluble tannin concentration become reduced 10 to 25 WAB and have a slightly increase during 10 to 20 WAB, but the soluble tannin concentration continues decrease rapidly in CPCNA. This phenomenon is not observed in JPCNA and non-PCNA ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>). Thus, we presumed that there may be a "coagulation effect" that soluble tannins converted to insoluble during late stage of CPCNA fruit development and caused de-astringency. </p> <p>Acetaldehyde is the product of pyruvate produced by glycolysis. As mentioned previously, acetaldehyde is one of the main compounds that render the soluble tannin insoluble and cause de-astringency. Synthesis of acetaldehyde is generally catalysed by PDC, which converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde. ADH is then involved in the potentially reversible interconversion of acetaldehyde and ethanol <a href="#b43">43</a>. In persimmon fruit, eight <i>DkADH</i> and <i>DkPDC</i> genes were isolated, and <i>DkADH1 and DkPDC2</i> have been suggested to be key genes involved in persimmon astringency removal <a href="#b29">29</a> <a href="#b30">30</a>. Compared to 25 °C water treatment, 40 °C water showed more effective in inducing de-astringency, but the fruits in 25 and 40 °C air cannot lose their astringency ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1D</a>). The soluble tannin was sharply decreased after 12 h treatment, company with insoluble tannin rapidly increased of fruits treated with 40 °C water ( <a href="#f1">Fig. 1D</a>). This results suggested that anaerobic condition caused fruits astringency removal, heat treatment only accelerate this process but was not necessary to remove fruits astringency. Both the KEGG pathways and GO enrichment results implied that glycolysis process and pyruvate biosynthesis is significantly enriched in underlying water-treated fruits ( <a href="#f3">Fig. 3B,E</a>). The genes for glycolysis process (i.e. <i>HXK, PGI, PFK, ALD, TPI, GAPDH, PGK, PGAM, NSE</i>, and <i>PK</i>), and specific for acetaldehyde biosynthetic (i.e. 14 <i>PDC-like</i> and 7 <i>ADH-like</i> genes) were markedly up-regulated ( <a href="#f5">Fig. 5A</a>). This is consistent with previous report that acetaldehyde was found to accumulate significantly in the flesh following the treatment of fruits with warm water <a href="#b17">17</a>, and acetaldehyde being the main compound involved in the insolubilization of soluble tannin <a href="#b22">22</a> <a href="#b23">23</a> <a href="#b24">24</a>. </p> <p>Based on the GO enrichment analysis up- and down-regulated genes shared in natural and water-treated de-astringency. We found 228 shared up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in the GO terms related to primary sugar metabolism were quite abundant ( <a href="#f4">Fig. 4B</a> and <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S5</a>). Several genes (i.e. 2 <i>PFK</i>, 1 <i>ALD</i>, 1 <i>GAPDH</i>, and 1 <i>PK</i>) that involved in glycolysis were also up-regulated in natural astringency removal ( <a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Phosphofructokinase (PFK) and Pyruvate Kinase (PK) are two key regulatory enzymes in plant glycolysis <a href="#b44">44</a>. Salminen and Young <a href="#b45">45</a> found that PFK, an important regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, was activated during ripening of banana fruit. ALD is a ripening related enzymes in strawberry fruits <a href="#b46">46</a>. In our pervious study, six <i>DkPK</i> genes were isolated from CPCNA ‘Eshi 1′, and <i>DkPK1</i> might play an important role in CPCNA natural de-astringency <a href="#b31">31</a>. We also obtained three <i>PDC-like</i> unigenes (i.e. <i>CL5884.Contig2_All, PDC_unigene2205_All, and Unigene57828_All</i>) specific up-regulated in natural de-astringency process ( <a href="#t2">Table 2</a> and <a href="#f5">Fig. 5A</a>). Mo <i>et al</i>. <a href="#b30">30</a> transiently over-expressed <i>DkPDC2</i> in persimmon leaves, resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of soluble PAs. We performed qRT-PCR to measure the expression of three <i>PDC-like</i> genes in three cultivars ( <a href="#f5">Fig. 5B</a>) and found that all three of the <i>PDC-like</i> genes were up-regulated during the development of persimmon fruits. <i>PDC_CL5884.Contig2_All</i> was specifically up-regulated after 20 WAB compared to that in non-PCNA. However, there were no <i>ADH-like</i> genes up-regulated in natural de-astringency ( <a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). We examined one <i>ADH-like</i> gene <i>CL1015.Contig8</i>, which highly induced in water treatment ( <a href="#f5">Fig. 5A</a>). The qRT-PCR also showed that <i>ADH_CL1015.Contig8</i> was down-regulated during fruit development. In addition, the aldehyde dehydrogenase family 2 gene <i>(ALDH2</i>) was suggested to be a regulator of persimmon de-astringency under ethanol treatment and catalyses the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid <a href="#b35">35</a>. The expression of <i>ALDH2_Unigene17942_All</i> was significantly down-regulated after 10 WAB in CPCNA and non-PCNA. This decrease in <i>ALDH2</i> expression might resulted in acetaldehyde accumulation. Thus, these results indicated that <i>PDC_CL5884_All, PDC_Unigene2205_All</i> and <i>ALDH2_Unigene17942_All</i> might be involved in CPCNA natural de-astringency. </p> <p>In persimmon fruits, two Myb-TFs ( <i>DkMyb2</i> and <i>DkMyb4</i>) were suggested to be involved in PA biosynthesis <a href="#b39">39</a> <a href="#b47">47</a>. And reduction in the <i>DkMyb4</i> expression causes the JPCNA specific down-regulation of PA biosynthesis at the early stage of fruit developmental and resultant non-astringent trait. <i>DkbZIP5</i> was found response to seasonal abscisic acid signal act as a <i>DkMYB4</i> regulator and modification of PA accumulation in JPCNA persimmon fruits <a href="#b48">48</a>. However, a few transcription factor have been suggest to be involved in the de-astringency response in CPCNA persimmon fruit. Only six transcription factors were characterized can trans-activate soluble tannin coagulation related genes (i.e. <i>DkADH1, DkPDC2</i>, and <i>DkPDC3</i>), these include four <i>DkERF</i> genes ( <i>DkERF9/10/19/22</i>), one <i>MYB</i> transcription factor ( <i>DkMYB6</i>), and one <i>bZIP</i> gene ( <i>DkTGA1</i>) <a href="#b29">29</a> <a href="#b33">33</a> <a href="#b49">49</a> <a href="#b50">50</a>. Here, 43 TFs (i.e. 10 <i>ERF</i>, 8 <i>ETR</i>, 1 <i>ETO</i>, 6 <i>WRKY</i>, 6 <i>zinc finger</i>, 4 <i>NAC</i>, 4 <i>MYB</i>, 1 <i>bZIP</i>, and 3 <i>bHLH</i>) were specific up-regulated in natural de-astringency. And 10 TFs (i.e. 4 <i>ERF</i>, 3 <i>NAC</i>, 2 <i>WRKY</i>, and 1 <i>zinc finger</i>) shared up-regulated in two de-astringency process ( <a href="#f8">Fig. 8A</a>). Among these up-regulated TFs, we found ethylene-related TFs was enriched in natural de-astringency, followed by <i>WRKY</i> and <i>NAC</i> transcription factors. Furthermore, the many GO terms found for the up-regulated genes also related to ethylene response ( <a href="#S1">Supplementary Dataset S5</a>). This results implied that these TFs (i.e. ethylene-related and natural de-astringency specific expressed TFs) may involve in CPCNA natural astringency removal via activating glycolysis/acetaldehyde pathway genes expression and convert soluble tannin into insoluble by acetaldehyde and resultant non-astringent at later stage of fruit development. </p> <p>Based on our data and previous studies, we propose a hypothesis for the natural de-astringency of CPCNA fruit ( <a href="#f9">Fig. 9</a>). The biosynthesis of PA precursors is believed to occur on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum surface; these precursors will first be transported into the vacuole by GST and MATE transporters. LAC has been suggested to participate in PA oligomerization/polymerization <a href="#b16">16</a> <a href="#b51">51</a>. In CPCNA fruits, PA synthesis was until at late stage of fruit development (20 WAB), the "dilution effect" was not enough to cause CPCNA fruits to loss its astringency, the excess soluble tannin may insolubilized with acetaldehyde continued to fully ripen and resultant non-astringent. </p> <p>In summary, an integrated analysis based on transcriptome and proteome were performed in CPCNA de-astringency. The differentially expressed genes and proteins undergoing de-astringency processes were identified. Based on the GO and pathway enrichment analysis, we found water treatment strongly up-regulated glycolysis/acetaldehyde metabolism, which confirm previous study that acetaldehyde was the main components for water-treated de-astringency. In natural de-astringency process genes/proteins involved in PA biosynthesis was markedly reduced and the significant GO terms found for the set of up-regulated genes were related to sugar metabolism and ethylene response pathway. The acetaldehyde biosynthesis-related genes and TFs that specific expressed in natural de-astringency were identified. These soluble tannin coagulation-related genes may help us understanding the molecular event of CPCNA natural de-astringency and persimmon breeding in future. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Plant materials</div> <p>The persimmon ( <i>Diospyros kaki</i> Thunb.) fruits of ‘Eshi 1′ (CPCNA type), ‘Youhou’ (JPCNA type) and ‘Mopanshi’ (non-PCNA type) were obtained from the Persimmon Repository of Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. Three biological replicates were collected from three individuals, and each biological replicates contained 10–15 fruits. These samples were collected 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 weeks after bloom (WAB). Another group of ‘Eshi 1′ fruits sampled at 10 WAB (three biological replicates) were then treated with water (25 and 40 °C) and their corresponding control (25 and 40 °C air treatment) were collected at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h after treatment. All of the fruits were peeled, and the flesh at the equator was collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at −80 °C until use.
