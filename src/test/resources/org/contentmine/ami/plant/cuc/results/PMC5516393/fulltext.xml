However, SCWs in other plants can vary from this. The SCW of mature cotton seed fibres is highly cellulosic and lacks lignification whereas xylem SCWs are lignocellulosic. We used cotton as a model to study different SCWs and the expression of the genes involved in their formation via RNA deep sequencing and chemical analysis of stem and seed fibre.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Transcriptome comparisons from cotton xylem and pith as well as from a developmental series of seed fibres revealed tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression of several NAC transcription factors some of which are likely to be important as top tier regulators of SCW formation in xylem and/or seed fibre. A so far undescribed hierarchy was identified between the top tier NAC transcription factors SND1-like and NST1/2 in cotton. Key SCW MYB transcription factors, homologs of Arabidopsis MYB46/83, were practically absent in cotton stem xylem. Lack of expression of other lignin-specific MYBs in seed fibre relative to xylem could account for the lack of lignin deposition in seed fibre. Expression of a MYB103 homolog correlated with temporal expression of SCW CesAs and cellulose synthesis in seed fibres. FLAs were highly expressed and may be important structural components of seed fibre SCWs. Finally, we made the unexpected observation that cell walls in the pith of cotton stems contained lignin and had a higher S:G ratio than in xylem, despite that tissue&#x02019;s lacking many of the gene transcripts normally associated with lignin biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our study in cotton confirmed some features of the currently accepted gene regulatory cascade for &#x02018;typical&#x02019; plant SCWs, but also revealed substantial differences, especially with key downstream NACs and MYBs. The lignocellulosic SCW of cotton xylem appears to be achieved differently from that in Arabidopsis. Pith cell walls in cotton stems are compositionally very different from that reported for other plant species, including Arabidopsis. The current definition of a &#x02018;typical&#x02019; primary or secondary cell wall might not be applicable to all cell types in all plant species.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-017-3902-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Secondary cell wall</kwd><kwd>Primary cell wall</kwd><kwd>Transcription factor</kwd><kwd>Cotton</kwd><kwd><italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic></kwd><kwd>Cellulose synthase</kwd><kwd>Lignin</kwd><kwd>Syringyl</kwd><kwd>Guaiacyl</kwd><kwd><italic>p</italic>-Hydroxyphenyl</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Cotton Breeding Australia</institution></funding-source><award-id>CBA 19</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (AU)</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Development of secondary cell walls (SCWs) was a key event during the evolution of land plants. The thick, specialised SCWs of xylem vessels and xylem fibres of angiosperms and tracheids of gymnosperms allow trees to grow to more than 100&#x000a0;m in height. In many species, pollen release and fertilisation, as well as seed dispersal are facilitated by specialised SCWs. Plants can also deposit localised &#x02018;SCW-like&#x02019; structures in response to pathogen attack, or in specialised cells types such as transfer cells. Domesticated cottons produce long seed fibres that have extremely thick SCWs and hence are traded globally in textile and biomaterial markets. Our most comprehensive understanding on how SCWs are made has mainly come from detailed work over the last decade on xylem vessels and fibres in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and other plants such as poplar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], spruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The SCWs in these plants are generally considered as &#x02018;typical&#x02019; SCWs: they are composed of approximately equal measures of cellulose, lignins and hemicelluloses, and some proteins, but the specific composition can be variable between tissues and species. SCWs are deposited between the cell&#x02019;s external primary cell wall (PCW) and the plasma membrane, often once cell expansion has ceased, and are usually orders of magnitude thicker than the PCW.</p><p id="Par5">The current view of the regulation of lignocellulosic SCW deposition is that a cascade of SCW-specific NAC (for <bold>N</bold>AM, <bold>A</bold>TAF1/2, and <bold>C</bold>UC2) and MYB (<bold>my</bold>elo<bold>b</bold>lastosis) transcription factors (TFs) regulate downstream TFs such as other NACs, MYBs, and KNATs (<bold>kn</bold>otted-like from <italic><underline>A</underline></italic>

They are an exceptional example of a &#x02018;highly cellulosic&#x02019; SCW being composed of ~94% cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and with almost no lignin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Its SCW is so different to lignocellulosic SCWs that it is not surprising that the genes involved in its formation, or at least their expression, are different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. On the other hand, the SCWs in cotton stem xylem are more likely to be similar to those in other plants. In a novel approach, that enables understanding of how the same genome can translate to entirely different cell walls, we have used cotton as a model to study global gene expression differences in a range of tissues and cells depositing compositionally different cell walls to understand how those compositions may be regulated at a transcriptional level. We also use state of the art NMR and biochemical analyses as well as microimaging to determine the compositional differences amongst xylem, pith, and seed fibre cells within the cotton plant. We discovered that cotton tissues contain a number of &#x02018;atypical&#x02019; cell wall types that are regulated through modified hierarchical gene cascades that have diverged from those found in other plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant growth and tissue harvest</title><p id="Par12">

NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Biospin AVANCE 700-MHz spectrometer fitted with a cryogenically-cooled 5-mm quadruple-resonance <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>31</sup>P/<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N QCI gradient probe with inverse geometry (proton coils closest to the sample). <sup>1</sup>H&#x02013;<sup>13</sup>C HSQC experiments were carried out using the standard Bruker pulse sequence &#x02018;hsqcetgpsisp2.2&#x02019; (phase-sensitive gradient-edited 2D HSQC using adiabatic pulses for inversion and refocusing), using the following parameters: acquired from 11.5 to &#x02212;0.5&#x000a0;ppm in F2 (<sup>1</sup>H) with 1682 data points (acquisition time 100&#x000a0;ms), from 215 to &#x02212;5&#x000a0;ppm in F1 (<sup>13</sup>C) with 620 increments (F1 acquisition time 8.0&#x000a0;ms) with a 0.5&#x000a0;s interscan delay (D1); the d<sub>24</sub> delay was set to 0.86&#x000a0;ms (1/8&#x000a0;J, J&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;145&#x000a0;Hz). Processing used typical matched-Gaussian apodization (GB&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001, LB&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.1) in F2, and squared cosine-bell and one level of linear prediction (32 coefficients) in F1. The central DMSO peak was used as internal reference (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub>: 39.51, &#x003b4;<sub>H</sub>: 2.49&#x000a0;ppm). Volume integration of contours was performed on data reprocessed without linear prediction, and used Bruker&#x02019;s TopSpin 3.2 (Mac) software. For S/G/H quantification, the S2/6 (C<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>6</sub>-H<sub>6</sub>), G2 (C<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>) and H2/6 (C<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>6</sub>-H<sub>6</sub>) correlations were used, and the G2 integral was logically doubled.

Previous work had suggested that SCWs of mature seed fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and those of cotton stem pith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] may be lignified, so we measured acetyl bromide lignin (ABL) in the cell walls from xylem, pith, and mature seed fibre and characterised the lignins by NMR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Stem xylem and pith from the same stem segments both contained high levels of lignin. Mature seed fibre, on the other hand, contained only low amounts of measurable ABL. NMR of mature and immature (25 DPA) seed fibre could not detect signals for guaiacyl nor syringyl lignin but could detect two peaks in aromatic regions that are consistent with the existence of <italic>p</italic>-hydroxphenyl units. If lignin does exist in cotton seed fibre it has an unusual composition in that it is not composed of the typical &#x0201c;G&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;S&#x0201d; subunits found in &#x02018;normal&#x02019; dicot lignins. NMR indicated that the lignin in the pith tissue had a substantially higher S:G ratio (~70:30) than that in the xylem (~40:60). The higher S:G ratio of pith lignin was also reflected in its lignin structure as indicated by the larger peak of <bold>A</bold>&#x003b2;(S) than of <bold>A</bold>&#x003b2;(G) in the aliphatic region of the spectra.</p><p id="Par23">To characterise polysaccharide composition, we performed monosaccharide linkage analysis on the cell walls from stem xylem, stem pith, and seed fibre at 7 DPA (PCW, SF07), at 14&#x02013;16 DPA (transition to SCW, SF15), and at 25 DPA (SCW, SF25) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We found that although seed fibre walls at maturity were over 90% cellulose with almost no lignin, cell walls during fibre elongation (SF07) and the transition to SCW development (SF15) contained considerably less cellulose and had more pectic polysaccharides and the hemicelluloses xyloglucan, heteroxylan, and heteromannan than those fibres actively depositing SCWs at 25 DPA. The relative proportion of callose was very low in xylem and pith and low in 7 DPA walls, but was highest in the transition walls, as has also been reported by Maltby, Carpita [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The cotton stem xylem cell walls were more typical of other dicot SCWs being composed predominantly of cellulose, lignin, and heteroxylan. Stem pith cell walls, surprisingly, had a composition similar to that in xylem, but with a greater proportion of pectic polysaccharides with a higher degree of methyl esterification (DE). They also had relatively high levels of lignin, cellulose, and heteroxylan, all of which are not &#x02018;typical&#x02019; of PCWs in Arabidopsis and some other plant species. It is therefore difficult to describe cotton stem pith as a classical PCW tissue, but considering that these cells lack any obvious secondary wall thickening and stain like primary walls with toluidine blue while giving a positive Maule reaction for lignin (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), without further extensive analysis, we can only suggest that the pith in cotton is composed of cells with lignified PCWs and a composition that is &#x02018;atypical&#x02019;.

The absence of notable levels of <italic>MYB42/85</italic>-related gene transcripts and presumably also protein in cotton seed fibre provides at least a partial explanation for the low lignin content observed for these cells.

</p><p id="Par46">Curiously, the highest transcript level for one of the genes encoding a <italic>F5H</italic> homolog (<italic>Gorai.007G197700</italic>) was in 25 DPA seed fibre with no notable expression in any of the other seed fibre samples or pith and approximately ten times less in xylem, despite there being no substantial monolignol synthesis in this tissue. As mentioned earlier, F5H expression is directly activated by MYB103 in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. However, MYB103 has also been shown to regulate CesA8 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a regulatory step that most likely contributes to efficient cellulose synthesis in SF25 as discussed earlier. Similarly, we detected high levels for one <italic>CAD</italic>-related gene (<italic>Gorai003G049600</italic>) specifically in 7 and 15 DPA seed fibre. The roles of these genes in this tissues are unknown, but it is possible that both F5H and CAD enzymes, if produced, are used in metabolic pathways, such as in secondary metabolite or cuticle formation, rather than in monolignol production.</p><p id="Par47">In contrast to the genes encoding enzymes of the lignin-specific phenylpropanoid pathway, there was seed fibre-specific expression of genes encoding enzymes of the flavonoid-specific pathway, with the highest transcript levels in elongating fibres at 7 and 15 DPA. We also identified at least one gene encoding each of the enzymes of the general pathway (PAL, C4H, and 4CL) that showed high transcript levels in at least one of the seed fibre samples. This suggests that these enzymes are providing the precursors for flavonol rather than for monolignol synthesis in seed fibre. Seed fibres indeed contain flavonoids and expression of flavonoid synthesis-related genes in seed fibre has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The function of flavonoids in seed fibre has not been established, but it is generally accepted that flavonoids have various functions in plants including responses to abiotic and biotic stress. Suppressed development of seed fibre upon repression of <italic>F3H</italic> in cotton indicates, however, that flavonoids are necessary for seed fibre development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">Despite both having SCWs, cotton seed fibres and xylem tissues are very different in both cell wall composition and transcript profiles. Cotton seed fibre transcriptomes after about 15 DPA show that they become dedicated to the production of their main cell wall polysaccharide, cellulose, leading to their unusual highly cellulosic SCWs that are essentially devoid of any lignin at maturity. It has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] that SCW production during seed fibre development has been re-programmed during domestication and selection in modern breeding to suppress lignin biosynthesis whilst recruiting stress-response genes needed to achieve greater fibre cell length and make cotton fibres more useful for textiles, and this is evident in our transcriptome data.</p><p id="Par49">We used stem pith as an example of a non-seed fibre PCW tissue, but discovered that cotton pith walls appear to be another example of an &#x02018;atypical&#x02019; dicot wall. Histology and transcript analysis suggest they are PCWs, but compositional analysis detected significant levels of lignin and xylan normally characteristic of SCWs. Few studies have compared the chemistry of PCWs and SCWs from the same species and in the same part of the plant, so it is difficult to determine if this truly is unusual or specific to cotton.</p><p id="Par50">Comparisons between different tissues within cotton have indicated that cotton SCW deposition, like that in Arabidopsis, is probably regulated by a hierarchical cascade of transcriptional activation and repression that regulates cell wall polysaccharide, lignin, and protein composition. Top tier factors like SND1/NST1 and VND, that are conserved between cotton and Arabidopsis, initiate cotton SCW development, but key MYB regulators in lower tiers are missing from seed fibres and in the other tissues are different to those prominent in Arabidopsis, explaining their &#x02018;atypical&#x02019; cell wall compositions. Even stem xylem that contains a more &#x02018;typical&#x02019; SCW, has a regulatory network that is different in detail to those described for other species.</p><p id="Par51">Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> summarises our key findings on cotton SCW biogenesis in both seed fibre and xylem. In xylem SCW development, a number of key NAC TFs, including ANAC036/61, ANAC071/96, VND, SND2/3, NST1/2, and the MYB TF MYB61 are some of the most abundant of the SCW activators. The lignin transcriptional activator MYB42/85 is also very abundant. In this tissue, the monolignol biosynthetic genes are far more abundant than those for cellulose synthesis and deposition or for cell wall structural proteins. The situation in seed fibres, however, is quite different. At the transition to SCW deposition, SND1<italic>-like</italic>, MYB103, and MYB61 are amongst the most abundant transcriptional activators, while the repressors KNAT7 and MYB4/7/32 are also abundant. There is very little expression of the lignin transcriptional activator MYB42/85. By 25 DPA, there is an increased abundance of SND2, MYB103, and KNAT7, and to a lesser extent MYB61, SND1<italic>-like</italic>, NST1/2, while MYB42/85 expression remains low. Also at this stage there is very high expression of cellulose biosynthetic genes, and cell wall structural genes like FLAs. In contrast, the monolignol biosynthetic genes, except for <italic>F5H</italic>, are very low in abundance. SND1<italic>-like</italic> appears to act upstream of the other factors and together with MYB103, SND2, MYB61, and NST1/2 leads to the strong activation of cellulose production and some cell wall structural proteins, while MYB42/85 expression is repressed or not activated, resulting in the absence of lignin in theses &#x02018;atypical&#x02019; SCWs that make cotton fibres so ideal for industrial uses.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Concept map of cotton TF and cell wall genes for SCW synthesis.
