A genome-wide gene expression analysis involving four different periods was identified. Twenty-eight coexpression modules with distinct patterns were performed for transcriptome profiling.

Low temperature damage is mainly caused by changes in the phospholipid bilayer membrane, especially conformational space and physical state. The formation of ice crystals leads to not only excessive protoplasmic dehydration and protein denaturation, but also mechanical damage to plant cells.</p><p id="Par7">Previous research regarding the mechanisms of plant cold hardiness demonstrated that plants can improve their cold resistance mainly in the following four ways: (1) increasing the variety of proteins induced by low temperature; (2) upregulating the expression of multiple cold resistance gene without control through the DREB/CBF transcription factor; (3) regulation of low temperature&#x02013;induced genes by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ABA; and (4) increasing the expression of unsaturated fatty acid enzymes. Proteins induced by low temperatures are functional proteins that improve plant cold hardiness and protect cells from the cold. These include antifreeze proteins (AFP), DNA-binding proteins, and mRNA-binding proteins such as bZip proteins and other related enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dozens of cold-induced genes have been isolated from arabidopsis, rice, and other plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since Stockinger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] first cloned AtCBF1 from arabidopsis cDNA libraries, cloning of DREB/CBF transcription factor genes has been performed to better understand its functions. At present, DREB/CBF has been cloned from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], <italic>Glycine max</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], <italic>Brassica napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and <italic>Zea mays</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The over-expression of DREB/CBF can enhance plant cold hardiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the early 1980s, ABA received attention for its relevance with plant cold hardiness. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> los5 and los6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] mutants with a decreased ABA level are more sensitive to low temperatures than wild types. At present, the role of ABA in plant cold resistance has been confirmed in many kinds of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Research on the effect of membrane phosphatidylglycerol fatty acids on plasma composition, as well as on the relationship with cold hardiness, in 74 plant species showed that plasma membrane unsaturated fatty acid has a great influence on cold hardiness. Higher unsaturated fatty acid content increases plant cold hardiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, genetic manipulation of fatty acid desaturation changes the sensitivity of plants with low temperature stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Cold hardiness is indispensable for the winter survival of perennial plants. Therefore, the process for plants overwintering involves multiple genes. This multi-level network regulation is complex.</p><p id="Par8">
<italic>Agropyron mongolicum</italic>, a perennial grass, is distributed in Eurasian steppe, mainly in Russia, Mongolia, and northern China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. <italic>A. mongolicum</italic> has a high nutritional value with a protein content of 18.64%. Its stem leaves are soft with good palatability for animal husbandry. It also exhibits high ecological value because of its drought resistance, cold resistance, and suitability for dry sandy areas. <italic>A. mongolicum</italic> belongs to the wild relatives of <italic>Triticum</italic>. Its cold resistance, drought resistance, salt tolerance, resistance to diseases and pests, and excellent resistance genes provide a genetic resource for genetic modification of food crops (such as wheat and barley). Many perennial plants can sexually reproduce and clone growth at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These plants are called clonal plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The seed development rate of <italic>A. mongolicum</italic> is low, and studies have shown that the fruit set rate is only 43.45% under suitable conditions. Therefore, it is a typical clonal plant that has new plant generation mainly from the mother plant through an underground horizontal rhizome. This type of root system is advantageous for <italic>A. mongolicum</italic>, as it is able to fully use soil nutrients and moisture from the space, providing structural basis for plant growth and development.</p><p id="Par9">
<italic>A. mongolicum</italic> from northern China was used in the present study. Comprehensive transcriptomics was conducted to evaluate global gene expression profiles during four stages including normal growth period (October 5, 2014), before winter (November 1, 2014), during winter (January 31, 2015), and after reviving (March 16, 2015). For our sample collection, the studied time points included normal growth, lowest temperature, and return to green, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. We found a large number of different expression genes (DEGs), and our weighted gene co-expression network analysis demonstrated 28 modules.
