    "Miscanthus is a promising lignocellulosic bioenergy crop for bioethanol production. To identify candidate genes and regulation networks involved in secondary cell wall (SCW) development in Miscanthus, we performed de novo transcriptome analysis of a developing internode. According to the histological and in-situ histochemical analysis, an elongating internode of M. lutarioriparius can be divided into three distinct segments, the upper internode (UI), middle internode (MI) and basal internode (BI), each representing a different stage of SCW development. The transcriptome analysis generated approximately 300 million clean reads, which were de novo assembled into 79,705 unigenes. Nearly 65% of unigenes was annotated in seven public databases. Comparative profiling among the UI, MI and BI revealed four distinct clusters. Moreover, detailed expression profiling was analyzed for gene families and transcription factors (TFs) involved in SCW biosynthesis, assembly and modification. Based on the co-expression patterns, putative regulatory networks between TFs and SCW-associated genes were constructed. The work provided the first transcriptome analysis of SCW development in M. lutarioriparius. The results obtained provide novel insights into the biosynthesis and regulation of SCW in Miscanthus. In addition, the genes identified represent good candidates for further functional studies to unravel their roles in SCW biosynthesis and modification."
