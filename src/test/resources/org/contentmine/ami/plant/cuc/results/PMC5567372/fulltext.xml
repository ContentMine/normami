<italic>Miscanthus</italic> is a perennial C4 rhizomatous grass originated from eastern and southern Asia. The <italic>Miscanthus</italic> genus contains more than 14 species, of which four major species (i. e., <italic>Miscanthus sinensis</italic>, <italic>Miscanthus floridulus</italic>, <italic>Miscanthus sacchariflorus</italic>, and <italic>Miscanthus lutarioriparius</italic>) are most extensively distributed in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Recently, <italic>Miscanthus</italic> has been considered one of the most promising bioenergy crops for lignocellulosic bioethanol production owing to its superior characteristics such as high biomass yield, wide suitability to cultivation on marginal land, and low fertilizer requirement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. As a widely distributed species in central China, <italic>M. lutarioriparius</italic> has been paid particular attention because of its overwhelmingly higher biomass yield, vigorous growth habitus and wide adaptation to various abiotic stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">One of the major steps in bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass is the release of fermentable sugars embedded in secondary cell walls (SCWs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. SCW is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and phenolic polymer lignin, which interact and cross-link with each other to form a rigid and complex network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As biomass consists predominately of SCWs, thus the compositions and cross-linking among different components of SCW are of significant impact on biomass recalcitrance to saccharification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In this perspective, a thorough understanding of key genes involved in SCW biosynthesis and modification lays the prerequisite for tailor-designing of optimized biomass characteristics in bioenergy crop breeding.</p><p id="Par4">Reverse genetics analysis and biochemical assays have revealed a subset of genes involved in SCW biosynthesis and modification, especially in dicot model species <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Cellulose is comprised of linear &#x003b2;-1,4-glucan chains. It is synthesized at the plasma membrane by members of cellulose synthase (CESA) enzymes. The deposition of cellulose in SCWs requires the cooperative functions of CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Hemicellulose usually consists of linear &#x003b2;-1,4-linked backbones, which are usually substituted with various side chains. Based on side chain substitutions, hemicellulose can be classified into several categories including heteromannans, xyloglucans, heteroxylans, and &#x003b2;-(1,3;1,4)-mix-linked glucans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Xyloglucans are the predominant hemicelluloses in the primary cell walls of dicots, while xylans are the most abundant hemicellulose components in SCWs of dicots and both primary and secondary walls of commelinid monocots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A number of genes from the CESA-like (CSL) family have been revealed to participate in the biosynthesis of various hemicellulosic polysaccharides. For instance, several CSLA family genes from glycosyltransferase (GT) family 2 have been demonstrated to be responsible for the biosynthesis of the glucomannan backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Several members of the CSLC family are implicated in the biosynthesis of the xyloglucan backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Members from CSLF and CSLH families have been revealed to participate in the biosynthesis of mixed-linkage &#x003b2;-glucan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, a number of GTs from other families have also been identified to be involved in xylan biosynthesis. For example, IREGULAR XYLEM (IRX) 9 and IRX14 from GT43 family, and IRX10 from GT47 family are required for the elongation of the xylan backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, whereas FRAGILE FIBER (FRA) 8/IRX7 from GT47 family, IRX8 and PARVUS from GT8 family are involved in the synthesis of the reducing-end tetrasaccharide of xylan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Lignin is a complex aromatic polymer synthesized from phenylpropanoid precursors. It primarily consists of three monomeric subunits, i.e., p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Lignin biosynthesis has been well-characterized and almost all the genes for each step of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway have been identified by utilizing reverse genetic approaches and biochemical assays in different plant species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Besides these major components, SCWs also contain a minor proportion of structural proteins. These cell wall proteins are trapped in the complex networks formed by cell wall polysaccharides and lignin. Although cell wall proteins are minor components in SCWs, they play essential roles in maintaining cell wall strength and confer appropriate properties to cell walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Among the cell wall proteins, expansions are considered one of the major regulators of cell wall loosening and extensibility during plant cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, extensins and arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), which belong to the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) family, also play essential roles in the cell wall assembly and modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Biochemical analysis has also led to the identification of various types of enzymes associated with cell wall polymer degradation and remodeling. Among the numerous enzymes, one of the most characterized is the glycosyl hydrolases (GHs). GHs constitute large gene families in plants and have been implicated to be involved in the remodeling and rearrangement of plant cell walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. GH9 family represents one of the best characterized plant GH families. The KORRIGAN (KOR) protein from GH9 family has been revealed to play an important role in cellulose biosynthesis. It might function in the cleavage of a sterol-cellodextrin precursor or assist in the assembly of glucan chains in the growing microfibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, several members from GH10 and GH11 families are considered to catalyze the modification and degradation of hemicelluloses (e.g., xyloglucan and xylan)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Meanwhile, considerable progress has been gained toward the understating of the transcriptional regulation of SCW biosynthesis in the last decade. The NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) function as master switches in the regulation of SCW biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Several NAC TFs, such as SECONDARY WALL ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (SND1)/NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 3 (NST3), have been shown to orchestrate the expression of a cascade of down-stream TFs (e.g., MYB46 and MYB83), which cooperatively regulate the expression of SCW biosynthesis genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Although significant progress in SCW biosynthesis has been made in the model species <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying SCW biosynthesis, assembly and modification in bioenergy crop <italic>Miscanthus</italic>. <italic>M. lutarioriparius</italic> is a diploid (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2x&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) with a complex genome estimated to be approximately 2000 Mb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The genome sequence of <italic>M. lutarioriparius</italic> has not been released yet, which imposes great difficulties to genome-wide studies on SCW-related genes in this species. However, with the advancement of the next-generation sequencing technology and ever-decreasing of sequencing cost, <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome analysis without a reference genome provides an alternative means to the identification of genes involved in many important physiological processes. Transcriptome profiling has been successfully utilized to identify genes involved in SCW biosynthesis in diverse plant species, including poplar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, sorghum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, <italic>Medicago</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and switchgrass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, despite the importance of optimized SCW properties to the improvement of saccharification efficiency in bioethanol production, such transcriptome analysis aimed to explore genes involved in SCW development is still lacking in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we carried out transcriptome analysis of <italic>M. lutarioriparius</italic> using three consecutive internode segments, representing different stages of SCW development, with an attempt to advance the understanding of SCW biosynthesis and regulation in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>.

However, it remains to be elucidated if TFs have interacting roles during the transcriptional regulation program in stress resistance and cell wall development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">In this study, we performed <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome analysis of an enlongating internode to identify genes involved in SCW development in <italic>M. lutarioriparius</italic>, an important bioenergy crop with high lignocellulosic biomass yield. The histological and <italic>in-situ</italic> histochemical analysis revealed that the elongating internode can be divided into three segments with distinct SCW development states: the UI with abundant primary cell walls, the MI undergoing substantial cell wall thickening, and the BI with predominant SCWs deposited. Transcriptome profiling analysis among the UI, MI and BI led to the identification of genes involved in the biosynthesis of SCW components including cellulose, hemicellulose (arabinoxylan) and lignin, as well as minor structural proteins and TFs involved in cell wall assembly and modification. Furthermore, putative regulatory networks involving TFs and SCW-associated genes were constructed based on gene co-expression patterns. The work presented is the first transcriptome analysis of SCW development in <italic>M. lutarioriparius</italic>. These findings shed new light on the biosynthesis and regulation of SCW in grasses. The genes identified provide excellent candidates for further functional characterization and genetic improvement of lignocellulosic biomass properties toward increased saccharification efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par40">

The second internode counted from the top at stage E11 (elongating-stem comprising 11 internodes) was harvested from six plants representing two biological replicates. The average length of the internodes collected is 91.2 mm, which is approximately 40% of the maximum length at anthesis. After removal of leaves and sheaths, the internode was equally dissected into the upper, middle and basal segments, excluding 1&#x02009;cm adjacent to each side of the internode.
