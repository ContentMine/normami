  <result pre="The advantage of the former sampling method is that the" exact="cell wall" post="development state of the sample is dramatically divergent and"/>
  <result pre="because of the large differences that might include differences besides" exact="cell wall" post="development among stem segments (or internodes), the DEGs identified"/>
