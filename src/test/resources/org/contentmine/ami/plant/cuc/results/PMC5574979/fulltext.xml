RNA-seq approach was deployed to understand the host-pathogen interaction by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for resistance to <italic>in-vitro</italic> seed colonization (IVSC) at four critical stages after inoculation in J 11 (resistant) and JL 24 (susceptible) genotypes of groundnut. About 1,344.04 million sequencing reads have been generated from sixteen libraries representing four stages in control and infected conditions. About 64% and 67% of quality filtered reads (1,148.09 million) were mapped onto A (<italic>A. duranensis</italic>) and B (<italic>A. ipa&#x00451;nsis</italic>) subgenomes of groundnut respectively. About 101 million unaligned reads each from J 11 and JL 24 were used to map onto <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome. As a result, 4,445 DEGs including defense-related genes like senescence-associated proteins, resveratrol synthase, 9s-lipoxygenase, pathogenesis-related proteins were identified. In <italic>A. flavus</italic>, about 578 DEGs coding for growth and development of fungus, aflatoxin biosynthesis, binding, transport, and signaling were identified in compatible interaction. Besides identifying candidate genes for IVSC resistance in groundnut, the study identified the genes involved in host-pathogen cross-talks and markers that can be used in breeding resistant varieties.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Aflatoxins are a group of carcinogenic mycotoxins produced mainly by <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>.

Use of cultivars resistant to seed invasion by <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. is one of the possible means of reducing aflatoxin contamination during groundnut storage with no extra input cost for the farmers. Development of aflatoxin resistant groundnut varieties has been a challenging task for breeders due to lack of availability of reliable resistance sources, poor understanding of plant-fungus interactions and large environmental influence. Three types of resistance mechanisms namely <italic>in-vitro</italic> seed colonization resistance (IVSC), resistance to pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination (PAC) and resistance to aflatoxin production in seeds have been reported in groundnut. However, the aflatoxin is produced only in the cotyledons of groundnut kernels after fungal infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Sources of resistance to these mechanisms were identified independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms of resistance to aflatoxin contamination.</p><p id="Par4">The differential transcriptome analysis based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), can provide insights to understand resistance mechanisms and offers the possibilities of identifying novel genes and splice variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Very recently, transcript profiling of resistant and susceptible groundnut post-harvest seeds has been undertaken in response <italic>A. flavus</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, none of the above studies related to aflatoxin contamination provided the decisive insights on genomic control and solution for their deployment in developing improved varieties.</p><p id="Par5">As aflatoxin is produced preferentially in the seed and IVSC is the first step towards fungal infection, it is considered as the most important stage during aflatoxin contamination.

Similar approach was successfully used to study rice-blast fungus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and sorghum-leaf spot fungus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> interactions. In present study, the pathogen transcriptome analysis indicated expression of genes related to fungal growth, aflatoxin production and transport. The genes related to initiation of pathogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, conidiation, transportation were regulated at initial period (1DAI) and that of aflatoxin production, peroxidation process were upregulated at 3DAI in compatible interaction. This observation can be correlated to the higher level of aflatoxin estimated at 3DAI. The presence of transporters implies an important role in fungal nutrient uptake as well as in signal transduction. Most of transporter proteins detected in the present study were integral part of the membrane proteins that might play very important role in inter-kingdom cross-talks.</p><p id="Par30">The initiation of pathogenesis starts with the recognition of receptor like kinases (RLK) by the plant cell for pathogen detection. In the present study, the expression of large number of RLKs <italic>viz</italic>., serine-threonine protein kinase (br1-like, nak types), wall-associated receptor kinase-like 9, LRR family protein, etc. were observed in both compatible and incompatible interactions. NBS-LRR genes are the TF binding genes involved in plant defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.
