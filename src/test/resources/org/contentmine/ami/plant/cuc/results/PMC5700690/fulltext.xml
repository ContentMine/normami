The timing of flowering is regulated by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Specifically, the plant genes controlling flowering are induced via synchronization of climatic and environmental conditions. Thus, flowering time varies extensively according to climate and latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. For crop production, it is important to coordinate the flowering time with changes of environment to avoiding adverse natural conditions during flower differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With the advance of molecular biology, genes controlling flowering time in annual crops such as <italic>Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare</italic>, and especially in model plants <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, have been identified, which mainly belong to four pathways interacting to each other including photoperiod pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], GA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], vernalization pathway, and autonomous pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For winter cereals, low temperatures and long days following low temperatures are the major driving factors for plant development and flowering.</p><p id="Par67">Vernalization or jarovization was first defined by Lysenko et al. in 1986 when it was observed that wheat varieties required cold for stem elongation and flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Vernalization in winter cereals depends on a highly integrated and complex system of development, involving numerous structural and regulatory genes in an intricate network of signaling pathways. Flowering time of certain species strongly correlated with day time length and temperature during vernalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In wheat, chromosomes 5A and 5D play an important role in determining the responses to vernalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In barley, a series of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in clusters associated with heading dates have been found on chromosome 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Subsequent studies revealed other colinear regions of chromosomes 5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], 5B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and 5D in wheat; the genes were cloned in sequential studies and named the vernalization family (<italic>VRN</italic>) since they are extensively involved in the vernalization response. The latter demonstrated that <italic>VRN3</italic> is completely linked to a gene similar to the <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)</italic> in <italic>A.thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A model was further developed to elaborate the function of <italic>VRN1, VRN2,</italic> and the FT genes in response to vernalization. Prior to cold exposure, <italic>VRN2</italic> represses the expression of <italic>FT</italic>. During cold exposure, <italic>VRN1</italic> expression increases, resulting in the repression of <italic>VRN2,</italic> which in turn allows activation of FT during long days, thus inducing flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the vernalization pathway converge on <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)</italic>, a MAD-box transcription regulator; furthermore, its activator FRIGIDA represses flowering via increase of <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The upstream gene <italic>WRKY34</italic>-induced and CULLIN3A (<italic>CUL3A</italic>)-dependent on FRIGIDA, modulate flowering in response to vernalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A latest study on transcriptome sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) suggested that <italic>VRN1</italic> binds the promoter of <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T-like</italic>, and also targets <italic>VRN2</italic> and <italic>ODDSOC2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This reasearch provide more information on flowering regulation of cereal crop.</p><p id="Par68">With the known genetic background and natural variations, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is an excellent tool in studying the complexity of vernalization regulation. Currently, the full flowering network can only be approached in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Studies on <italic>Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum,</italic> and <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> have led to the identification of components within individual signaling pathways that affect flowering as well as their positioning within molecular hierarchies. Even more importantly, the current study concentrates on annuals. In contrast to annuals, perennials require a long vegetative phase to accumulate and achieve the transition to the reproductive stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, perennials still retain meristems in a vegetative state once they become adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Obvious differences and more complex molecular mechanisms are involved in vernalization, due to the differential life-cycles.</p><p id="Par69">Orchardgrass (<italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic> L.) is a winter perennial gramineae grass, which is native to northern Africa, western and central Europe, and temperate Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As an economically important perennial forage crop, orchardgrass has been widely used for a long time due to its good adaptability, abundant nutrients, and high biomass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Vernalization is an important physiological characteristic of orchardgrass, which decide the timing of flowering. A clear understanding of the molecular mechanism of flowering can provide a basis for targeted forage breeding. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate vernalization of perennial grass species remain unclear. In this study, we generated a comprehensive and continuous transcriptome of orchardgrass to elaborate dynamic changes of gene expression among different stages and constructed the co-expression network of genes responding to vernalization and flowering regulating. This research will facilitate the understanding of flowering mechanisms of perennial grasses in general.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material and RNA extraction</title><p id="Par70">A orchardgrass variety DONATA (Registered No. 398) was grown in a greenhouse of the Sichuan Agricultural University located in Chengdu (30&#x000b0;42&#x02032;N, 103&#x000b0;51&#x02032;E; Chengdu city, Sichuan, China) under natural light conditions, then was transferred to field in Chongzhou farm (30&#x000b0;37&#x02032;N, 103&#x000b0;40&#x02032;; Chongzhou city, Sichuan, China) prior to temperature reduction in the year of 2016.

For example, the qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of <italic>COL1</italic> and <italic>SPL3</italic> were down-regulated in stage BH_DON comparing to stage H_DON, while the sequencing data showed up-regulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F and P). In addition, the expression of <italic>CRY1</italic> was up regulated from stage VG_DON to BH_DON base on the qRT-PCR results, while the sequencing data showed the down regulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>). On the contrary, the expression of <italic>GAI</italic> was down-regulated in stage VG_DON relative to BH_DON, while the sequencing data showed up regulation(Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7M</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>qRT-PCR validation.

A comprehensive transcriptome profile of the critical periods, comprising vernalization, young spike differentiation, and flower development was obtained via RNA-seq. DEGs were identified and functional characteristics also elaborated. The analysis of expression patterns during six key developmental stages revealing the abundant diversity in gene expression. Stage-specific profiles indicated a dramatic shift in gene expression during different developmental stages, and while many genes were expressed constitutively, very few of these were expressed evenly throughout all stages. The analysis captured the distinct molecular characteristics during vernalization and flower formation in orchardgrass, which could be further explored to help understand flowering regulation in response to seasonal cues in grass.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Genome-wide expression profiling uncovered developmental modules in vernalization and flower formation</title><p id="Par102">The number of DEGs between the adjacent sampling points indicates that there were much more DEGs in phase 4 (P4) than any other phases, and more remarkably, phase 5 only had the least DEGs. This demonstrated that P4 involves far molecular processes and most of these processes have had a regulatory effect before heading. This result agrees with the markedly morphological alterations during P4 (inflorescence formation) and P5 (heading). The plant perception of vernalization and outgrowth of floral buds, involved numerous processes, both temporal and spatial. GO and KEGG analysis of DEGs throughout all five phases showed that the processes focused differently, which also supported this notion. The protein related processes, such as protein phosphorylation and kinases, and protein modification, were highlighted during P1, while the functional hormone related categories were also overrepresented. Protein phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating many cellular processes in eukaryotes. In particular, protein phosphorylation is a major currency of signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This result indicates that the plant responded to multiple environmental stimuli during this phase. Compared to P1, the functional categories of carbohydrate metabolic processes and sucrose metabolic processes were significantly enriched and previous research suggests that these two processes may associate with gene expression throughout dormancy in crown buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Cold temperature was involved in breaking dormancy, inhibiting shoot growth, and inducing flowering competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These are critical phases of plant floral bud formation and development during P4 and P5. The functional categories including cell wall, cytoskeletal, polysacharide metabolic, and catalytic activity, collectively coordinate organogenesis. These biomolecular processes potentially relate to subtle morphological changes. KEGG analysis of DEGs highlighted the otherness of temporal and spatial.</p><p id="Par103">We found various pathways that focus differently throughout developmental phases. In P1 and P2, plant hormone signal transduction, NOD-like receptor signaling, and MAPK signaling were emphasized. Plant hormones exhibit strong functions in response to endogenous signals and environmental cues. Furthermore, the ubiquitin biosynthesis pathways were also identified in this phase, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has been shown to regulate the different steps of plant hormone signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Ethylene is an important plant stress and defense hormone and MAPK modules act downstream of the receptors, thus mediating ethylene signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Recently, researchers suggested that the starch and sucrose metabolism, carbon metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction all mediate the timing of transition from vegetative to reproductive phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This report is consistent with our KEGG enrichment results during P3 and P4. The functional category of circadian rhythm-plant, flavonoid biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism were enriched in most phases, suggesting that biological processes during specific stages and non-specific stages play equally important roles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Stage-specific analysis outlines the core molecular processes related to vernalization and flower formation</title><p id="Par104">Coexpressed gene cluster analysis illustrated the temporal distribution of core molecular events during vernalization and floral bud formation. Our results suggested that transcriptome specialization is established at a specific stage for several biological processes. At vernalization stage, genes related to signal transduction and stress response were overrepresented. When temperature dropped, several mechanisms have been described to enhance the freeze tolerance, including changes in lipid composition, increases in active-oxygen-scavenging enzymes, anthocyanin accumulation, and carbohydrate metabolism, which are consistent with our transcriptome sequencing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Signal transduction includes protein phosphorylation, calcium ion signaling, plant hormone signaling pathways, and many metabolic processes. These various pathways reflect the biological processes of plants at this stage to receive and cope with the external multiple stimuli. For perennial grasses, vernalization induced by cold stimulation is critical for plant flowering. We can capture potential genes that mediate vernalization in these clusters. Our results also indicated that photosynthesis-related genes are show strong stage dependency and with high expression levels during V_DON stage, which may indicate these kind of genes are tightly co-expressed. Under normal conditions, low temperature causes photoinhibition of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; however, the elevated expression of these genes is consistent with previous studies. This suggests that the photosynthetic contribution (reproductive assimilation) of reproductive structures propagates production and influences flower initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Previous research demonstrated that CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation may play a regulatory role during early reproductive stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par105">To identify genes associated with flower formation, we examined genes with expression peak in BH_DON and H_DON. Several clusters highlighted a number of specialized features of transcriptome data. Subclusters_1_6, subcluster_5_1, and subcluster_5_3 revealed the importance of cell wall remodeling by the active cellulose metabolism in the BH_DON stage, which agrees with reports of cellulose as a cell wall polymer as found in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Plant cell wall-loosening proteins promote cell growth and are essential for floral bud initiation and differentiation. During the plant cell expansion process, microfibers are usually functional in the direction of cell expansion, which were laying down secondary cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, genes related to cellular aromatic compound metabolic processes, cell wall modification, cell wall macromolecule catabolic processes, and cell wall biogenesis also play pivotal roles in cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In addition, genes within cell morphogenesis, cell division, cell cycle, and cell differentiation categories with higher expression levels, are indicative of multiple processes that actively coordinate tissue development and organ morphogenesis during floral bud formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par106">This is exemplified by subclusters_5_5 and subcluster_5_6, which indicate a functional partition of different developmental stages by the expression pattern. These subclusters had higher expression during stages V_DON and VG_DON compared to other stages. The subclusters were characterized by genes related to signal transduction and stress responses, likely reflecting the fact that the external environment significantly influenced plant growth during these stages. A distinct gene set associated with cell proliferation and differentiation during BH_DON and H_DON provides evidence that genes with specific function express during a specific period. In other cases, expression preference exists even though gene clusters were expressed throughout the growth stage.</p><p id="Par107">WGCNA analysis enabled the identification of specific modules during critical developmental stages. The skyblue module and darkmagenta module connect with vernalization induction in stages V_DON and AV_DON. Furthermore, the grey60 module, red module, and brown module, may contain numerous genes that are associated with growth transduction, floral organ development, and flowering control, respectively. Furthermore, WGCNA also provided evidence in the interaction of different modules during certain stages. This clearly revealed a network of genes instead of individual genes, which may help to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization and flowering. Furthermore, the conjoint analysis of WGCNA and clustering analysis supplied a more efficient method to search core regulators in diverse and abundant data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Transcriptional regulation among different stages</title><p id="Par108">An analysis of genes that are associated with transcription regulation showed that TFs play an important role during vernalization and floral bud formation. Expression profiles during different developmental stages suggest temporal specialization of TFs and the data set can be used to identify key TFs relevant for flowering time control. For example, WRKY, MADS-BOX, and ABI3/VP1 transcription factor families were found to preferentially accumulate during vernalization, floral organ formation, and heading, which could be part of the transcriptional regulatory complex regulating stress response and flower development. Several WRKY transcription factors expressed in phase BH_DON and H_DON, which is consistent with their reported role in <italic>Miscanthus</italic>, including <italic>WRKY 12</italic>, which participates in cell wall formation and promotes flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. <italic>WRKY20</italic>, <italic>WRKY23</italic>, <italic>WRKY30</italic>, <italic>WRKY40</italic>, <italic>WRKY50</italic>, <italic>WRKY53</italic>, <italic>WRKY57</italic>, and <italic>WRKY70</italic> were involved in ABA and jasmonic acid signaling pathways in moderating flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The ABI3/VP1 transcription factor family encoded the B3 domain-containing protein and play a central role in embryogenesis and dormancy by regulating the gene expression during the plant embryo maturation via ABA responsive elements or conserved RY repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In a previous study, the B3 domain-containing protein demonstrated to participate in the early development of flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], including the reproductive meristem gene (REM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], which was preferentially expressed in reproductive meristems.</p><p id="Par109">The MADS-box family has been defined on the basis of primary sequence similarity amongst numerous proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In a previous study, the MADS-box was considered to play an important role during the origin and evolution of flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. MADS-box transcription factor suppressor of overexpression of CO1 (<italic>SOC1</italic>) signals from the GA-dependent pathway, which influences the flowering time during short days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The presence of MAD-box transcription factors is consistent with the overrepresentation of the regulation of transcription functional categories.</p><p id="Par110">In addition, Alfine-like and CCAAT transcription factor family were overrepresented in stages BH_DON and H_DON. Alfin-like transcription factors encoded several PHD finger proteins, including vernalization insensitive 3 (<italic>VIN3</italic>) and vernalization 5 (<italic>VRN5</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], which mediated both vernalization and photoperiod.

Furthermore, members of <italic>NF-YC</italic> can physically interact with constans (<italic>CO</italic>), and are genetically required for CO-mediated floral promotion.</p><p id="Par111">Previous research demonstrated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family to participate in controlling cell proliferation and development of specific cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Our study found bHLH TFs significant enriched during booting stage and heading time, suggesting this type of transcription factor family may play a similar role in the regulation of flower formation and heading. NAC transcription factors (<italic>NAM</italic>, <italic>ATAF</italic>, and <italic>CUC2</italic>) were described during recently years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], only a proportion of NAC proteins have been studied. NAC genes are tightly associated with embryonic, floral, and vegetative development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. We found NAC genes concentrated expression in phase BH_DON and H_DON in our data, meaning that this type of TFs are produced to join the pathways that lead to flower organ formation and flowering, which was consistent with the previous reports.</p><p id="Par112">The ethylen-responsive transcription factor (<italic>ERF</italic>) is an important member of <italic>AP2/EREBP</italic> and encoded a type of AP2 containing protein. Many ERFs have been reported to be involved in the regulation of floral development and stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This transcription factor family consists of a large quantity of genes that encode IAA, which have an important function in floral organ development and plant growth regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Hormone-related TF families <italic>AUX/IAA</italic> and <italic>AP2/EREBP</italic> were found in abundance at stage V_DON, VG_DON, BH_DON and H_DON, this suggested that ethylene biosynthesis and signaling have great function in stress response and are particularly associated with flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The auxin response factor (<italic>ARF</italic>) family comprises transcription factors that are known to act during different phases in floral organ formation and are operated by a complex transcriptional network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Furthermore, ARF transcription factors contribute to the response of abiotic stresses, containing <italic>ARF7</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic>. <italic>ARF</italic> is an important regulator of auxin activity, and these genes have maximal expression during stage H_DON, suggesting common centers for auxin biosynthesis and transduction during heading time. The diverse expression profiles of gene related hormone signaling may constitute the basis for this stage-specific response, also supplying evidence for the importance of hormones in vernalization and flower development.

The MYB-related gene Circadian 1 (<italic>CIR1</italic>) was identified in the transcriptome data and has been reported to affect several circadian-regulated processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In addition, MYB proteins mainly participated in signal transduction such as phytochrome A signaling, jasmonate signaling, ABA signaling, and GA signaling, which is involved in a variety of processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].
