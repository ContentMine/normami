To make biomass more suitable for biorefinery use, we need a better understanding of plant cell wall biosynthesis. Increasing the ratio of C6 to C5 sugars in the cell wall and decreasing the lignin content are two important targets in engineering of plants that are more suitable for downstream processing for second-generation biofuel production.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We have studied the basic mechanisms of cell wall biosynthesis and identified genes involved in biosynthesis of pectic galactan, including the GALS1 galactan synthase and the UDP-galactose/UDP-rhamnose transporter URGT1. We have engineered plants with a more suitable biomass composition by applying these findings, in conjunction with synthetic biology and gene stacking tools. Plants were engineered to have up to fourfold more pectic galactan in stems by overexpressing GALS1, URGT1, and UGE2, a UDP-glucose epimerase. Furthermore, the increased galactan trait was engineered into plants that were already engineered to have low xylan content by restricting xylan biosynthesis to vessels where this polysaccharide is essential. Finally, the high galactan and low xylan traits were stacked with the low lignin trait obtained by expressing the <italic>QsuB</italic> gene encoding dehydroshikimate dehydratase in lignifying cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The results show that approaches to increasing C6 sugar content, decreasing xylan, and reducing lignin content can be combined in an additive manner. Thus, the engineered lines obtained by this trait-stacking approach have substantially improved properties from the perspective of biofuel production, and they do not show any obvious negative growth effects. The approach used in this study can be readily transferred to bioenergy crop plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13068-017-1007-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Plant cell wall</kwd><kwd>Galactan</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>Pectin</kwd><kwd>jStack</kwd><kwd>Xylan</kwd><kwd>Lignin</kwd><kwd>Plant engineering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ecole Normale Sup&#x000e9;rieure de Cachan</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">By taking advantage of the massive energetic potential of plant lignocellulosic biomass, second-generation biofuels can be produced from a broad spectrum of renewable carbon sources without creating direct competition with the food production market. Lignocellulosic biomass is largely composed of secondary plant cell walls, which are thick walls surrounding some differentiated cells such as xylem vessels. Secondary walls are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and constitute the most abundant biomaterials on Earth. Cell wall polysaccharides can be enzymatically degraded to release monosaccharides through a process known as saccharification. Subsequently, microbes can be used to convert monosaccharides to produce bioethanol or other bioproducts. However, several characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass limit the yield of this process, making it expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Secondary cell wall polysaccharides are embedded in lignin, a polymer of cross-linked aromatic alcohols that protect the cell wall polysaccharides from enzymatic degradation by plant pathogens and pests, e.g., in case of nematode infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and contribute to biomass recalcitrance. Up to 35% of secondary cell walls are hemicelluloses, which in angiosperms are composed mainly of pentoses such as xylose and arabinose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because pentoses are less fermentable by microorganisms than hexoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], increasing the hexose/pentose ratio is one approach to improving biomass for biofuel production. Due to the low density of the lignocellulosic biomass, transportation costs to processing facilities are another limiting factor, especially for biomass from grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Engineering of plants with modified secondary cell walls more suitable for downstream processing could reduce costs and facilitate biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass.</p><p id="Par6">Nevertheless, modifying the cell wall also remains challenging because of its central role in many plant functions. Different groups have already investigated several approaches to making lignocellulosic biomass more suitable for conversion into bioethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Genetic engineering efforts to reduce lignin content typically employ techniques to constitutively repress lignin biosynthesis, e.g., by RNAi. However, these strategies frequently result in reduced plant size, and often more than one copy of the biosynthetic gene must be targeted to achieve reduced lignin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recently, we developed a gain-of-function strategy allowing a decrease in lignin content without any visible effect on plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana CINNAMATE</italic>-<italic>4</italic>-<italic>HYDROXYLASE</italic> (<italic>C4H</italic>) promoter was used to express the <italic>Quinate and Shikimate Utilization B</italic> (<italic>QsuB</italic>) gene encoding the 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase from <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> in lignified tissues of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. By converting 3-dehydroshikimate into protocatechuic acid, the QsuB enzyme produces two effects: (1) it limits the availability of shikimate, a precursor for lignin biosynthesis and a cofactor of hydroxycinnamoyl transferase and (2) it produces an inhibitor of the same transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Biomass from plants expressing <italic>QsuB</italic> in lignified tissues exhibits a 50% decrease in lignin content and shows improved saccharification efficiency.</p><p id="Par7">One approach to increase the hexose/pentose ratio in lignocellulosic biomass is to increase the proportion of hexose-rich polysaccharides in secondary cell walls. &#x003b2;-1,4-Galactan is entirely composed of galactose residues and is found as sidechains of rhamnogalacturonan I in pectin of primary cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Pectin, including &#x003b2;-1,4-galactan, is not abundant in secondary cell walls except in gelatinous fibers. Gelatinous fibers are found in plants such as flax and in tension wood, a specific type of wood that plays a role in maintaining appropriate plant growth under mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Tension wood of aspen trees has been reported to contain 10% of &#x003b2;-1,4-galactan, which is hypothesized to induce gel-like properties, conferring the contractile driving force of tension wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our previous work showed that the glycosyltransferase Galactan Synthase 1 (GALS1) is a &#x003b2;-1,4-galactan synthase involved in the biosynthesis of pectic galactan in the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Constitutive overexpression of <italic>GALS1</italic> in Arabidopsis increased the amount of galactose in leaf cell walls by 50% without an apparent effect on plant growth.</p><p id="Par8">Moreover, the co-overexpression of <italic>GALS1</italic> and the cytosolic <italic>UDP</italic>-<italic>glucose/UDP</italic>-<italic>galactose</italic>-<italic>4</italic>-<italic>epimerase 2</italic> (<italic>UGE2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] under the control of the 35S promoter led to an 80% increase in galactose in stem cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As UDP-galactose residues are polymerized in the Golgi apparatus, whereas UDP-galactose is synthesized in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], UDP-galactose transport from cytosol to Golgi could become limiting when <italic>GALS1</italic> and <italic>UGE2</italic> are both overexpressed. Recently, the Golgi-localized UDP-Rhamnose/UDP-Galactose Transporter 1 (URGT1) was shown to be involved in transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Overexpression of URGT1 led to increased &#x003b2;-1,4-galactan accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves, indicating that UDP-galactose transport may indeed be limiting for galactan biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitation in UDP-galactose in the Golgi lumen by co-overexpressing <italic>URGT1</italic> with <italic>GALS1</italic> and <italic>UGE2</italic>.</p><p id="Par9">Another approach to increase the hexose/pentose ratio in lignocellulosic biomass is to decrease the proportion of pentose-rich polysaccharides. The glycosyltransferase Irregular Xylem 7 (IRX7) is involved in the biosynthesis of xylan, a polymer of &#x003b2;-1,4-linked xylose units, which are highly abundant in secondary cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Compared to wild-type plants, <italic>irx7</italic> loss-of-function mutants have a lower xylan content and exhibit severe dwarfism due to collapsed xylem vessels and the consequent impairment of water and nutrient transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using the <italic>VND7</italic> vessel-specific promoter to express the <italic>IRX7</italic> coding sequence in the <italic>irx7</italic> mutant, the growth phenotype is rescued while the content of xylose residues in stem cell walls is still reduced by 20% as compared to non-engineered lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Here, we utilized this genetically engineered low pentose background and engineered increased galactan content to further increase the C6 to C5 ratio.</p><p id="Par10">The NAC (NAM/ATAF1/CUC2) Secondary cell wall Thickening-promoting factor 1 (NST1) transcription factor is a master regulator controlling secondary cell wall biosynthesis in fiber cells, which provide mechanical support to vessels in stems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. <italic>NST1</italic> is a potential target for the modification of cell wall thickness. However, its constitutive overexpression leads to the formation of ectopic secondary cell wall thickening and inhibits plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A system allowing overexpression of <italic>NST1</italic> without any negative effect on plant growth has been developed by Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A downstream promoter induced by NST1 is used to express a new chimeric copy of <italic>NST1</italic>, creating an artificial-positive feedback loop (APFL) and leading to the over-accumulation of NST1 in fiber cells only. Plants expressing a chimeric copy of <italic>NST1</italic> under the control of one of its target promoters have fiber cells with thicker secondary cell walls and, accordingly, lignocellulosic biomass obtained from their stems is of a higher density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In the present work, genetic engineering was used to modify cell wall composition and thickness in Arabidopsis, with the aim of increasing the C6 to C5 ratio, reducing biomass recalcitrance, and increasing the lignocellulosic biomass density obtained from plant stems for biofuel production.</p><p id="Par12">Overexpression of <italic>URGT1</italic> together with <italic>GALS1</italic> and <italic>UGE2</italic> increased the cell wall galactan content in stems without causing any growth defects. The use of constitutive promoters was compared with the use of secondary cell wall-specific promoters, which limit transgene expression to lignified tissues that constitute the major part of lignocellulosic biomass.</p><p id="Par13">We also stacked several previously described cell wall engineering strategies to evaluate additive effects and compatibility. First, increased galactan content and decreased lignin content traits were combined by overexpressing <italic>QSUB</italic> together with <italic>GALS1</italic>, <italic>UGE2,</italic> and <italic>URGT1</italic>. Secondly, increased cell wall thickness was combined with higher galactan content and/or lower lignin content through the overexpression of NST1, creating an APFL that increased secondary wall density in interfascicular fiber cells. Third, all these modifications have been combined with a decrease in xylan content by overexpressing the gene sets described above in a vessel-complemented xylan-deficient background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design, construction, and stacking of multiple genes for improved biomass traits</title><p id="Par14">We aimed to overexpress <italic>GALS1</italic>, <italic>UGE2,</italic> and <italic>URGT1</italic> involved in galactan biosynthesis; the <italic>NST1</italic> coding sequence to create an APFL increasing cell wall thickness in fibers; and the <italic>QsuB</italic> gene responsible for lignin decrease.

Thus, this may be indicative that brute-force overexpression strategies may have been exhausted and, in this specific combination, it is quite possible that we have reached the limits of genetic engineering. Alternatively, using different promoters or expressing the <italic>NST1</italic> APFL independently from <italic>UGE2</italic> could show different outcomes, as the increased expression of <italic>NST1</italic> results in higher than optimal level of expression of <italic>QsuB</italic> when the promoter (<italic>pCesA7</italic>) used to drive its expression is induced by the NST1 transcription factor. Testing different promoter combinations could likely overcome the detrimental phenotype.</p><p id="Par30">Using the jStack cloning method, we generated engineered lines carrying all the transgenes at the same locus and the use of a tissue-specific promoter allowed the coordinating spatio-temporal expression of the desired transgenes. Because we had experience with a limited number of strong fiber-specific promoters, we decided to use the 2A peptide to stack genes in addition to the jStack approach. This technique has previously been used successfully by others and in our laboratory. However, in W3-1 and W3-5 stem sections, the presence of the APFL driven by NST1 did not appear to result in a substantial increase of cell wall thickness in fibers compared to what we had observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As mentioned before, a better comprehension of the network regulation of cell wall-related genes and a different sequence arrangement could possibly lead to the desired increase in fiber cell wall density. Alternatively, it is possible that the enhancement of galactan biosynthesis in fibers with promoters that are responsive to NST1 may cause a drastic substrate competition for UDP-glucose between the cellulose and galactan biosynthesis pathways. That could perhaps lead to reduced ability to also increase cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis by overexpression of NST1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Engineered plants showed an increase of galactan in fibers</title><p id="Par31">Previously, we showed that the overexpression of <italic>UGE2 and GALS1</italic> driven by 35S promoter in Col-0 plant leads to 80% more galactose in the cell wall of stems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

However, our qPCR data did not confirm increased <italic>URGT1</italic> expression in all of our engineered lines relative to the control plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Some lines did show a three- to 11-fold increase in <italic>URGT1</italic> expression (i.e., W4-1 and X4-12) and these showed the highest increase in cell wall galactose accumulation, indicating the importance of boosting the expression of this gene. Expressing <italic>URGT1</italic> under a stronger fiber-specific promoter or inserting its native introns could perhaps result in producing even more galactan in cell walls due to increased transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi lumen. LM5 immunodetection showed that the additional galactose is located in fibers and assembled into galactan polymers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, by introducing more galactan in fibers of XE, we demonstrated that it is conceivable to produce dicot plants designed to have reduced xylan content and a high amount of C6 sugars in the secondary cell wall of fibers (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
