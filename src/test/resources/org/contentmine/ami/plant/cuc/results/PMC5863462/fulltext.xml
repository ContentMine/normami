However, most of the ripening&#x02013;associated changes (Phase 1 ripening) in kiwifruit during storage and on&#x02013;vine occur largely in the absence of any detectable ethylene. This ripening behavior is often attributed to basal levels of system I ethylene, although it is suggested to be modulated by low temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">To elucidate the mechanisms regulating Phase 1 ripening in kiwifruit, a comparative transcriptome analysis using fruit continuously exposed to propylene (at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), and during storage at 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was conducted. Propylene exposure induced kiwifruit softening, reduction of titratable acidity (TA), increase in soluble solids content (SSC) and ethylene production within 5&#x000a0;days. During storage, softening and reduction of TA occurred faster in fruit at 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C compared to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C although no endogenous ethylene production was detected. Transcriptome analysis revealed 3761 ripening&#x02013;related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 2742 were up&#x02013;regulated by propylene while 1058 were up&#x02013;regulated by low temperature. Propylene exclusively up&#x02013;regulated 2112 DEGs including those associated with ethylene biosynthesis and ripening such as <italic>AcACS1</italic>, <italic>AcACO2</italic>, <italic>AcPL1</italic>, <italic>AcXET1</italic>, <italic>Ac&#x003b2;&#x02013;GAL</italic>, <italic>AcAAT</italic>, <italic>AcERF6</italic> and <italic>AcNAC7</italic>.

Fruit are broadly classified into two groups (climacteric and non&#x02013;climacteric) based on the presence or absence of a marked increase in respiration rate and ethylene production at the onset of ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The ripening process is largely regulated by ethylene in climacteric fruit, while it is virtually independent of ethylene in non&#x02013;climacteric fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, most fruit have been reported to possess both ethylene&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent ripening components regardless of whether they are classified as climacteric or non&#x02013;climacteric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In climacteric fruit, ripening is accompanied by a shift from a negative feedback regulation (system I) to a positive feedback regulation (system II) of ethylene production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], through ethylene&#x02013;induced expression of <italic>1&#x02013;AMINOCYCLOPROPANE&#x02013;1&#x02013;CARBOXYLATE</italic> (<italic>ACC</italic>) <italic>SYNTHASE</italic> (<italic>ACS</italic>) and <italic>ACC OXIDASE</italic> (<italic>ACO</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Ethylene then binds to ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 (ETR1) and related proteins, transmitting the signal to ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2), ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3)/EIN3&#x02013;LIKE (EIL) and later to ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS (ERFs) in that order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The ERFs modulate the transcription of a wide range of ripening&#x02013;related genes that eventually result in fruit ripening responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Independent studies in tomatoes, kiwifruit, bananas and Arabidopsis have also revealed additional transcription factors (TFs) such as MADS&#x02013;BOX, MYB, and NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) that also regulate ethylene&#x02013;dependent fruit ripening through interactions with one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In various climacteric fruit, application of 1&#x02013;methylcyclopropene (1&#x02013;MCP) suppressed ripening responses due to irreversible binding and phosphorylation of ethylene receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using 1&#x02013;MCP, it was demonstrated that some ripening responses in tomato (such as peel de&#x02013;greening and aroma biosynthesis) are regulated by ethylene, while other responses (such as sugar accumulation) are not always dependent on ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, Tassoni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] used the inhibition of ethylene response by 1&#x02013;MCP to demonstrate that polyamines are not involved in tomato fruit ripening regulation. These results suggest that 1&#x02013;MCP is a very useful tool in elucidating ethylene&#x02013;independent fruit ripening responses.</p><p id="Par8">Kiwifruit (<italic>Actinidia</italic> spp.) are considered climacteric since exogenous application of ethylene induces rapid ripening&#x02013;associated changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, most of the ripening&#x02013;associated changes in kiwifruit occur before system II ethylene is produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, extensive ripening of kiwifruit in cold storage occurs in the absence of any detectable ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These unusual features of kiwifruit ripening are attributed to the basal levels of system I ethylene and/or changes in sensitivity, since kiwifruit are known to respond to ethylene levels as low as 0.01 &#x003bc;LL<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there is no substantive research to ascertain this hypothesis due to lack of comparisons between ripening patterns of kiwifruit during cold and ambient temperature storage. The greatest challenge during storage of kiwifruit is the incidence of postharvest diseases (blossom&#x02013;end rot, stem&#x02013;end rot, and body rot) caused by pathogens such as <italic>Botryosphaeria</italic> sp., <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Infected fruit produce disease&#x02013;induced ethylene, which may in turn induce ripening and feedback regulation of ethylene production in healthy adjoining kiwifruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, meaningful comparisons between the ripening behavior of kiwifruit during low and ambient temperature storage require the elimination of effects of exogenous ethylene emanating from disease&#x02013;infected fruit.</p><p id="Par9">Previously, we reported the faster softening and reduction of titratable acidity (TA) for &#x02018;Sanuki Gold&#x02019; kiwifruit stored at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C compared to 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C despite the lack of detectable ethylene production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Accelerated fruit softening at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was accompanied by increased accumulation of <italic>POLYGALACTURONASE</italic> (<italic>AcPG</italic>), <italic>PECTATE LYASE</italic> (<italic>AcPL</italic>), and <italic>EXPANSIN</italic> (<italic>AcEXP</italic>) mRNAs. Repeated treatments of kiwifruit with 1&#x02013;MCP failed to suppress the fruit ripening changes at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and hence we speculated that they were modulated by low temperature independent of ethylene. However, exogenous propylene also induced the expression of <italic>AcPG</italic>, <italic>AcPL</italic> and <italic>AcEXP</italic>, providing a window of doubt on whether the expression of these genes during low temperature storage was independent of ethylene or not. Therefore, the question remains on whether basal ethylene is involved in the modulation of ripening in kiwifruit during cold storage or not.</p><p id="Par10">Against this backdrop, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate kiwifruit ripening during low temperature storage by comprehensive transcriptome analysis. In the first experiment, the aim was to monitor ethylene production patterns of kiwifruit to devise an appropriate technique for storage of kiwifruit at room temperature. This would enable us to provide meaningful comparisons with low temperature storage. Secondly, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis with comparisons between kiwifruit stored at either 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for up to 8&#x000a0;weeks, relative to those exposed to propylene (an ethylene analogue). Thirdly, we monitored the ripening behavior of on&#x02013;vine kiwifruit with detailed comparisons to stored fruit and those exposed to propylene. Based on these experiments, we concluded that low temperature modulates ripening of kiwifruit independent of ethylene. We discuss the role of low temperature as a newcomer in the modulation of fruit ripening both during storage and on the vine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethylene production pattern in postharvest kiwifruit</title><p id="Par11">At room temperature, postharvest kiwifruit show a synchronized burst of ethylene production within 6&#x02013;25 d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], hindering possible comparisons of their ripening pattern with long&#x02013;term cold storage. We speculated that the early and synchronized ethylene bursts observed in a batch of kiwifruit was due to ethylene emanating from adjoining diseased fruit. First, we monitored the ethylene production pattern of kiwifruit stored close to each other in the same container (grouped storage, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Here, we observed that for all the four replications, kiwifruit stored in the same container exhibited a synchronized climacteric rise in ethylene production, although the occurrence of the climacteric ethylene peaks (7&#x02013;13 d) differed for each group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Next, kiwifruit were treated with a mixture of fungicides to reduce the initial pathogen inoculum, and stored in groups (four replications). We observed a significant delay in ethylene production in fungicide&#x02013;treated groups; synchronized climacteric ethylene peaks appeared between 19 and 30 d (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In both non&#x02013;treated and fungicide&#x02013;treated groups, a few fruit initiated ethylene production 1&#x02013;3 d prior to the others in the same group (see black arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). These early ethylene&#x02013;producing fruit exhibited rot symptoms (data not shown), suggesting that disease&#x02013;infected fruit was the trigger of coordinated ethylene production in kiwifruit stored in groups.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Ethylene production patterns of &#x02018;Sanuki Gold&#x02019; kiwifruit as affected by storage technique. In grouped storage technique, kiwifruit at commercial maturity were divided into groups of ten, placed into containers and then covered lightly to reduce water loss (<bold>a</bold>). Four groups were stored at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C without any treatment (<bold>b</bold>). Four other groups were pre&#x02013;treated with a mixture of fungicides (0.015&#x000a0;g/L oxytetracycline, 0.15&#x000a0;g/L streptomycin, 0.5&#x000a0;g/L iprodione, 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;10</sup>&#x000a0;cfu/L <italic>Bacillus subtillis</italic> HAI&#x02013;0404 spores and 0.5&#x000a0;g/L benomyl) prior to storage and fortnightly during storage at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (<bold>c</bold>). Ethylene production pattern of individual fruit in each group was monitored periodically. Each line represents the ethylene production pattern of a single fruit. Lines of the same color represent fruit stored within the same container. In individual storage technique, kiwifruit at commercial maturity were pretreated with a mixture of fungicides and individually wrapped in perforated polythene bags before being placed in containers, about 10&#x000a0;cm apart (<bold>d</bold>). One group contained non&#x02013;treated fruit (<bold>e</bold>), while another group of fruit were treated twice a week with 1&#x02013;MCP at 5 &#x003bc;LL<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> for 12&#x000a0;h (<bold>f</bold>). Fruit in all groups were stored at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in ethylene&#x02013;free chambers. Ethylene production pattern of each fruit in the respective groups was monitored periodically. The proportion of ethylene&#x02013;producing fruit was determined as a percentage of the total number of fruit in the respective groups (<bold>g</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2018_1264_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">Based on the above observations, we concluded that grouped storage is not appropriate for extending the postharvest life of kiwifruit at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Instead, we treated kiwifruit with a mixture of fungicides and placed them in containers, ~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;cm apart from each other (individual storage, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This setup consisted of non&#x02013;treated and 1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;MCP treated fruit. Interestingly, we observed that the duration required for ethylene initiation and occurrence of climacteric peaks varied depending on each fruit (Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). While &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% of fruit did not produce any detectable ethylene during the entire storage period (56 d at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), some fruit initiated ethylene production immediately after harvest, and others late during storage. The proportion of ethylene&#x02013;producing fruit gradually increased during storage reaching ~&#x02009;45% and ~&#x02009;33% at 56 d for non&#x02013;treated and 1&#x02013;MCP treated fruit, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Most of the ethylene&#x02013;producing fruit developed rot symptoms within a few days after ethylene initiation, which was consistent with previous observations in grouped storage. Thus, the use of individual storage technique enabled us to single out and remove fruit producing ethylene due to disease infections; this is important to avoid accumulation of exogenous ethylene in storage chambers. As a result, we managed to obtain healthy kiwifruit showing no disease symptoms and no detectable ethylene for up to 56&#x000a0;days of storage at room temperature. These fruit were used for further comparisons with low temperature storage, as well as ethylene&#x02013;dependent ripening.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effect of propylene on ripening in kiwifruit</title><p id="Par13">Continuous exposure of kiwifruit to propylene prompted an increase in ethylene production at 5 d, with a climacteric peak at 9 d (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Flesh firmness of kiwifruit also decreased with propylene treatment, from 64&#x000a0;N at 0 d to &#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;N at 3 d (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Furthermore, soluble solids content (SSC) increased rapidly from 7% at 0 d to &#x0003e;&#x02009;15% at 5 d, and TA decreased from ~&#x02009;2.7% at 0 d to &#x0003c;&#x02009;1% at 5 d in propylene&#x02013;treated fruit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). Non&#x02013;treated fruit exhibited insignificant changes in ethylene production and flesh firmness while the changes in SSC and TA were much slower. Together, these results denote the ethylene&#x02013;dependent ripening phenomenon in kiwifruit.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Ethylene&#x02013;induced ripening in &#x02018;Sanuki Gold&#x02019; kiwifruit.

Thus, to avoid the effects of exogenous ethylene emanating from disease&#x02013;infected fruit, it is important to provide adequate spacing between individual fruit coupled with active removal of fruit producing detectable ethylene (individual storage technique).

Fruit in all treatments were individually separated by ~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;cm to allow for monitoring of ethylene production of each fruit. Any fruit that produced detectable ethylene (&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.01&#x02009;nLg<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>) was transferred to separate storage chambers to prevent the ethylene from affecting adjoining fruit. These fruit exhibited a climacteric rise in ethylene production, developing rot disease symptoms within a few days of transfer. Therefore, only fruit that did not produce detectable ethylene (healthy fruit) were used for the analysis of fruit firmness, SSC, and TA at two&#x02013;week intervals using 5 independent biological replications (five fruit).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Evaluation of on&#x02013;vine kiwifruit ripening</title><p id="Par39">To monitor the on&#x02013;vine ripening behavior, kiwifruit were harvested on 11 different occasions ranging from Sep. 11, Sep. 19, Oct. 2, Oct. 10, Oct. 22, Nov. 4, Nov. 14, Nov. 26, Dec. 4, Dec. 10 and Dec. 17 (corresponding to 124, 132, 145, 151,163, 178, 188, 200, 208, 214 and 222 DAFB respectively).
