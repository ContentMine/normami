    "The red-skinned fruit of Japanese apricot (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc) appeals to customers due to its eye-catching pigmentation, while the mechanism related to its colour formation is still unclear. In this study, genome re-sequencing of six Japanese apricot cultivars was carried out with approximately 92.2 Gb of clean bases using next-generation sequencing. A total of 32,004 unigenes were assembled with an average of 83.1% coverage rate relative to reference genome. A wide range of genetic variation was detected, including 7,387,057 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 456,222 insertions or deletions and 129,061 structural variations in all genomes. Comparative sequencing data revealed that 13 candidate genes were involved in biosynthesis of anthocyanin. Significantly higher expression patterns were observed in genes encoding three anthocyanin synthesis structural genes (4CL, F3H and UFGT), five transcription factors (MYB-bHLH-WD40 complexes and NAC) and five anthocyanin accumulation related genes (GST1, RT1, UGT85A2, ABC and MATE transporters) in red-skinned than in green-skinned Japanese apricots using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Eight main kinds of anthocyanin s were detected by UPLC/MS, and cyanidin 3-glucoside was identified as the major anthocyanin (124.2 mg/kg) in red-skinned cultivars. The activity of UDP-glucose flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase enzyme determined by UPLC was significantly higher in all red-skinned cultivars, suggesting that it is the potential vital regulatory gene for biosynthesis of anthocyanin in Japanese apricot."
