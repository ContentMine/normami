This biosynthesis is strictly controlled by an array of transcription factors. Here, we show that SND1, a regulator of cell-wall biosynthesis, regulates abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis to ensure optimal plant growth. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the lack of SND1 and its homolog NST1 leads to the deficiency of secondary cell walls, preventing <italic>snd1nst1</italic> double mutant seedlings from growing upright. Compared to wild type seedlings, the <italic>snd1</italic> knockout mutant seedlings accumulated less anthocyanin and exhibited low tolerance to salt stress. Compared to wild type seedlings, the <italic>snd1</italic> knockout seedlings were more sensitive to salt stress. Although SND1 can bind to the promoter of <italic>Myb46</italic>, we observed that SND1 binds directly to the promoter of the <italic>ABI4</italic> gene, thereby reducing ABA levels under normal growth conditions. Thus, plants adjust secondary cell wall thickening and growth via SND1. SND1 has a dual function: it activates the Myb46 pathway, fostering lignin biosynthesis to produce sufficient cell wall components for growth, while maintaining a low ABA concentration, as it inhibits growth. This dual function of SND1 may help plants modulate their growth efficiently.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><award-id>2017R1A2B4008706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>Chan Young</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Won Je</given-names></name><name><surname>Truong</surname><given-names>Hai An</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Joo Yeon</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Sulhee</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Kwang Yeon</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Chon-Sik</given-names></name><name><surname>Moon</surname><given-names>Joon-Kwan</given-names></name><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Suk-Whan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In addition to primary cell walls, plant cells also have secondary walls, composed of cellulose, lignin, and other molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Because only certain types of plant cells can deposit secondary cell wall materials, including phenylpropanoid, during specific developmental phases, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is strictly controlled by an array of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which have been targeted to modify lignin content in order to manipulate biomass composition, as well as plant tolerance to abiotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Diverse transcription factors (TF) modulate various compounds in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. AtMyb46 and its homologs AtMyb83, AtMyb58 and AtMyb63, play crucial roles in cell-wall biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2)-domain TFs are also xylem-associated, and 105 NAC genes with numerous functions exist in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Among these, the secondary wall-associated NAC domain protein 1 (SND1) is expressed in fibre-associated cells and plays a central role in fibre thickening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Complex and multifaceted signalling cascades, accompanied by various cellular responses, are activated in plants to ensure their survival under conditions of abiotic stress. Plant cells produce osmoprotectants to compensate for the water loss caused by salt, drought, or cold stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. High salinity and drought may cause a marked imbalance in redox homeostasis, which drives plant cells to reorganize primary as well as secondary metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In this process, plant hormones serve as crucial integrators that modulate complex developmental and stress signalling pathways. Among them, abscisic acid (ABA) enables <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to adapt to detrimental conditions imposed by abiotic stress and often triggers the inhibition of plant growth, thereby re-directing nutrients for successful withstanding of the specific stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Anthocyanins are recognized as part of the defence mechanism that plants use when challenged by stress. Indeed, they often accumulate in response to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We aimed to verify whether SND1, the master controller of cell-wall biosynthesis, has any role under plant stress, as expression of <italic>SND1</italic> is known to affect the accumulation of lignins which are produced from the same precursor of anthocyanins. Herein we report that SND1 directly regulates ABA biosynthesis to procure best possible plant growth under salinity stress. Furthermore, we show that SND1 binds directly to the promoter of the <italic>ABI4</italic> gene, leading to low levels of ABA under saline conditions. Our observations suggest that plants can adjust secondary cell-wall thickening and growth performance via this SND1 regulatory effect, which displays a dual function by thickening secondary walls, while concomitantly reducing ABA content when environmental conditions are favourable plant growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Altered anthocyanin content in the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutant and <italic>SND1</italic>-overexpressing line and <italic>SND1</italic> was induced by abiotic stresses</title><p id="Par5">In our previous study, we showed that several genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis participate in plant abiotic stress tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Plants accumulate a wide variety of flavonoids via phenylalanine through elaborate regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. There are several junctions in this pathway, leading to the synthesis of different types of flavonoid compounds. For example, coumaroyl CoA, which is utilized to produce anthocyanins via various enzymes including chalcone synthase (CHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, can be converted into lignins by hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT). Thus, the synthesis of anthocyanin likely affects the synthesis of lignin, which belongs to the flavonoid family. SND1 is essential for the synthesis of lignin, and thereby for the formation of secondary cell walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">To determine whether the changes in lignin accumulation due to the changes in SND1 expression affect anthocyanin synthesis, we obtained seeds of the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutant from TAIR and examined abiotic stress tolerance of this line. We then measured the anthocyanin content in the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutant and in the <italic>SND1</italic>-overexpressing (<italic>SND1-OE</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Notably, the anthocyanin content in four-day-old seedlings was lower in the mutant and higher in the <italic>SND1</italic>-overexpressing line than in the Col-0 wild type (WT). Under normal conditions, SND1 serves as a positive regulator of lignin synthesis. Therefore, overexpression of <italic>SND1</italic> should theoretically increase lignin accumulation and decrease anthocyanin accumulation. In contrast, lignin content is expected to decrease and anthocyanin content to increase in the mutant. A similar observation has been previously reported, whereby the overexpression of <italic>SND1</italic> reduced lignin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These results indicate that SND1 is positively involved in the accumulation of anthocyanin. The expression of most flavonoid-related genes increased in the <italic>SND1</italic>-overexpressing line, but decreased in the <italic>snd1nst1</italic> double mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). NST1 is a homologue of SND1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and marked effects on secondary wall biosynthesis are observed when both are deleted. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the expression of <italic>PAP1</italic> in the <italic>snd1nst1</italic> double mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), which specifically activates the expression of genes associated with flavonoid synthesis. These results show that SND1 plays a positive role in the expression of genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis, thereby increasing anthocyanin accumulation.</p><p id="Par7">Anthocyanin is a part of the plant defence mechanism. In fact, anthocyanin often accumulates in response to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We verified whether SND1 has a role in plant stress responses, as the expression of <italic>SND1</italic> is known to affect the accumulation of anthocyanin. Thus, the transcript level of <italic>SND1</italic> was measured in Col-0 by the qRT-PCR, upon treatment with different plant hormones and stresses. In the presence of salt or mannitol, the expression of <italic>SND1</italic> increased. Similar results were observed with abscisic acid (ABA) treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In particular, the expression of <italic>SND1</italic> was significantly higher under salinity stress than under other stress conditions tested. These results indicate that SND1 is related to osmotic stress, especially in response to salinity stress, as well as to secondary cell wall synthesis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Relative expression of the <italic>SND1</italic> transcript in plants subjected to different hormone treatments or abiotic stresses.

We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine if SND1 can bind directly to the promoter of the <italic>NCED3</italic> gene. Contrary to our expectation, SND1 did not bind to the <italic>NCED3</italic> promoter (data not shown). We further tested the promoters of other genes (ABA anabolism-related genes: <italic>ZEP</italic>, <italic>SDR1</italic>, and <italic>AAO3</italic>; and a catabolism-related gene: <italic>CYP707A3</italic>) by the ChIP assay, but found no binding activity. However, when ABA signalling-related genes, including <italic>ABI3</italic> and <italic>ABI4</italic>, were subjected to the ChIP assay, SND1 clearly bound to the promoter of the <italic>ABI4</italic> gene, but not to the promoter of <italic>ABI3</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

We further characterized the SND1 binding site in the <italic>ABI4</italic> promoter region by dividing them into several small sections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). We analyzed cis-elements of <italic>ABI4</italic> promoter region by PlantCARE program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

We have long been studying the responses of plants to environmental stress and have found that flavonoids play an important role in these resistance mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the present study, our findings reveal new functions of SND1 in ABA signalling. We hypothesized that reducing the lignin content via a knockout mutation of its master controller <italic>SND1</italic> might enhance abiotic stress tolerance. Contrary to our expectation, we observed that the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutation lowered the anthocyanin content, whereas it increased in the <italic>SND1</italic> overexpression line (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, we observed altered expression of a variety of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in both <italic>snd1ko</italic> and <italic>SND1-OE</italic> plants. These results suggest that SND1 plays a role in anthocyanin accumulation, besides it role in the synthesis of lignin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the role of SND1 in anthocyanin biosynthesis has not been previously studied.</p><p id="Par15">We investigated how the expression of <italic>SND1</italic> varies upon various treatments with hormones under different growing conditions. The results revealed that the most significant change in SND1 was caused by salinity stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This change in the expression of SND1 in response to salinity stress may correlate with the reduced survival rate of <italic>snd1ko</italic> plants in the presence of salt at high concentration in the medium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). One possibility is that the <italic>snd1ko</italic> plants accumulate less anthocyanins, which serve as antioxidants. Another possibility is that SND1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of other genes, such as some of the ABA signalling genes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we screened a number of genes by the qRT-PCR to identify genes with altered transcript level in <italic>snd1ko</italic>, in response to salinity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). In this analysis, the <italic>Myb46-OE</italic>/<italic>snd1ko</italic> line was included, as we wanted to know if <italic>Myb46</italic>, one of the target genes of <italic>SND1</italic> in the lignin biosynthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, can recover the altered phenotype of <italic>snd1ko</italic> when it is overexpressed in the <italic>snd1ko</italic> background. The results revealed that Myb46 is not involved in the SND1-driven alterations in terms of ABA related stress responses (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). It has been reported that double knockout mutations of <italic>MYB46</italic> and <italic>MYB83</italic> result in secondary cell wall deficiency, thereby limiting plant growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, the finding of the present study imply that SND1 likely drives different sets of genes to control ABA signalling and ABA biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par16">In the search for SND1 target genes, we initially focused on the <italic>NCED3</italic> gene, based on the qRT-PCR results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The <italic>NCED</italic> genes encode 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, which catalyzes the cleavage of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid to xanthoxin in the key regulatory ABA biosynthesis step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. NCED3 is important for ABA biosynthesis during drought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, as evidenced by the fact that <italic>nced3</italic> mutants exhibited increased water loss and low ABA content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, the <italic>snd1ko</italic> plants may accumulate more ABA than WT, as the NCED3 transcript level was found to be higher in this mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). In accordance with this result, we observed that the <italic>snd1ko</italic> plants accumulated more ABA than WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The <italic>SND1</italic>-complementation line exhibited the recovery of <italic>snd1ko</italic> in terms of ABA content. Moreover, enhanced ABA content in the <italic>snd1ko</italic> plants seems to confer increased germination sensitivity to ABA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). However, by the ChIP analysis, we found that SND1 does not bind to the promoter of <italic>NCED3</italic> (data not shown). Thus, we performed the ChIP analysis with other possible candidate genes, which revealed that the <italic>ABI4</italic> gene is an SND1 target. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, the <italic>ABI4</italic> transcript level was enhanced in the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutant. Our detailed ChIP analysis and yeast one hybrid assay clearly demonstrated that SND1 directly bound to the <italic>ABI4</italic> promoter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Moreover, the result of EMSA showed that SND1 interacts with promoter fragment of &#x02212;1386 to &#x02212;1536 from <italic>ABI4</italic> coding DNA sequence. ABI4 also has been shown to positively regulate seed dormancy through ABA biosynthesis by directly binding to the promoters of <italic>CYP707A1</italic> and <italic>CYP707A</italic>2, thereby, repressing their expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. <italic>Arabidopsis CYP707A</italic> encodes ABA 8&#x02032;-hydroxylase, which plays key roles in ABA catabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, as indicated by the observation that the enhanced expression level of <italic>CYP707A1</italic> and <italic>CYP707A2</italic> in the <italic>abi4 ko</italic> mutant reduced ABA content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe any difference in the transcript levels of <italic>CYP707A1</italic> and <italic>CYP707A2</italic> between in WT and the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutant (data not shown). In contrast, ABI4 is known to increase the expression of <italic>CHO1</italic> which is an activator of <italic>NCED3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Hence, the increase in ABA content in the <italic>snd1ko</italic> mutant was not caused by the suppression of <italic>CYP707A1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>, but by the genes <italic>CHO1</italic> and <italic>NCED3</italic>.</p><p id="Par17">Abscisic acid frequently plays a central role in adaptation of plants to environmental stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In the present study, we demonstrated that SND1 has more than one function; it can reduce ABA biosynthesis via the repression of <italic>ABI4</italic> (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and it can also enhance lignin biosynthesis through <italic>Myb46</italic> activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ABA has been shown to reprogram transcriptional schemes for improved adaptation to abiotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this pathway, ABA bound to PYR/PYL/RCAR (PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1/PYR1-LIKE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS) receptors, and inhibits ABI1, ABI2, HAB1, and PP2CA protein phosphatases, thus activating SnRK2 protein kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition to triggering the stress defence pathways and closing of stomata, one important function of ABA is to inhibit seedling growth. A transcriptional mechanism associated with the inhibition of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> has been proposed in association with ABA function. Moreover, ABA modulates the function of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and nutrient transporters to adjust of plant growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. On the basis of our results, we propose a working model of the dual function of SND1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Under normal conditions, plants can allocate all available resources to the growing points; however, they have to redirect them under growth-limiting conditions, of one kind or another. Therefore, it is plausible to reason that SND1 activates Myb46, thereby fostering the biosynthesis of lignins to produce sufficient cell wall components needed for plant growth, while maintaining a low concentration of ABA, a growth inhibitor. Such dual function of SND1 may help plants to modulate their growth patterns to suit specific growth environmental conditions and, thus, thrive in the best possible way under such circumstances.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Working model of SND1, negatively regulating ABI4 in the ABA biosynthesis pathway.
