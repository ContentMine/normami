<abstract>
<p>Plants exchange signals with other physical and biological entities in their habitat, a form of communication termed allelopathy. The underlying principles of allelopathy and secondary-metabolite production are still poorly understood, especially in desert plants. The coordination and role of secondary metabolites were examined as a cause of allelopathy in plants thriving under arid and semiarid soil conditions. Desert plant species, <italic>Origanum dayi</italic>, <italic>Artemisia sieberi</italic> and <italic>Artemisia judaica</italic> from two different sources (cultivar cuttings and wild seeds) were studied in their natural habitats. Growth rate, relative water content, osmotic potential, photochemical efficiency, volatile composition and vital factors of allelopathy were analyzed at regular intervals along four seasons with winter showing optimum soil water content and summer showing water deficit conditions. A comprehensive analysis of the volatile composition of the leaves, ambient air and soil in the biological niche of the plants under study was carried out to determine the effects of soil water conditions and sample plants on the surrounding flora. Significant morpho-physiological changes were observed across the seasons and along different soil water content. Metabolic analysis showed that water deficit was the key for driving selective metabolomic shifts. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>judaica</italic> showed the least metabolic shifts, while <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sieberi</italic> showed the highest shifts. All the species exhibited high allelopathic effects; <italic>A. judaica</italic> displayed relatively higher growth-inhibition effects, while <italic>O. dayi</italic> showed comparatively higher germination-inhibition effects in germination assays. The current study may help in understanding plant behavior, mechanisms underlying secondary-metabolite production in water deficit conditions and metabolite-physiological interrelationship with allelopathy in desert plants, and can help cull economic benefits from the produced volatiles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Allelopathy is a widely documented phenomenon occurring in natural and man-made ecosystems in which plants release natural products (allelochemicals) that influence the establishment and growth of neighboring plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Bhowmik1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Xu1">[2]</xref>. Alleopathy has been mostly studied in terms of correlative evidence based on the identification of allelochemicals being released in potent concentrations from leaves, roots and stems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Bhowmik1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Einhelling1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. However, due to the complexity of the chemicals, it is difficult to determine the precise role of a specific natural compound in allelopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Belz1">[5]</xref>. A large variety of natural compounds are known to cause allelopathy, with secondary metabolites constituting the most important group of allelochemicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Belz1">[5]</xref>. Most allelopathy experiments are based on isolating putative compounds and testing their phytotoxicity in vitro. However, most plant interactions are mediated in soil environments; therefore the inclusion of soil as a testing ground for the determination of allelopathic interactions is warranted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Bhowmik1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Blum1">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, an influence of soil behavior on allelochemical activity cannot be ruled out, as several allelochemicals have shown a decline in potency when applied in soil suspensions vs. solution. Thus, the reported role of soil in reducing the phytotoxicity of natural products again suggests its inclusion as a platform to study allelopathic interactions among plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Blum1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Weston1">[8]</xref>. Allelochemicals are usually produced in plant cells and accumulate in specific organs, sometimes in special organelles. Leaves may be the most consistent source, while stems and roots are considered to contain less potent toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Weston1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Miranda1">[9]</xref>. Allelochemicals are released by plants into the soil or atmosphere by volatilization or leaching from the aerial plant parts, eventually becoming deposited on other plants or soils. Leaching may also occur through plant residues, exudation from plant roots into the soil environment and decomposition of plant residues, releasing toxic substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Blum1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Rachmilevitch2">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In general, allelochemicals are representing a myriad of chemical compounds from simple hydrocarbons and aliphatic acids to complex polycyclic structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Blum1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Miranda1">[9]</xref>. Allelochemicals include simple water-soluble organic acids and unsaturated lactones, long-chain fatty acids and polyacetylenes, naphthoquinone, anthroquinones and complex quinones, simple phenols, benzoic acid and derivatives, cinnamic acid and derivatives, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids and steroids, amino acids and polypeptides, alkaloids and cyanohydrins, sulfides and glucosides, purines and nucleotides, coumarins, thiocyanates, lactones and actogenins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Weston1">[8]</xref>. Allelochemicals can act indirectly through alteration of soil properties, nutritional status, population composition or activity of microorganisms and nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Xu1">[2]</xref>. They can also act directly via biochemical/physiological effects on various important processes of plant growth and metabolism, such as mineral uptake, mitosis (inhibition), hormonal regulation, respiration (stimulation or inhibition), protein synthesis (inhibition) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Weston1">[8]</xref>, enzyme activity (inhibition) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Teerarak1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Poonpaiboonpipat1">[13]</xref>, membrane permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Xu1">[2]</xref>, photosynthesis (inhibition) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Qian1">[14]</xref> and more.</p>
<p>In agriculture, the effect of weeds on crops, crops on weeds and crops on crops have been thoroughly studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Xu1">[2]</xref>. Weeds interfere with crops by inhibiting their germination and seedling establishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Hussain1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Lorenzo1">[17]</xref>. Plants thriving in arid and semiarid regions of the world are known to face water deficit conditions. Several phenotypic adaptations and acclimations such as reduced plant growth, modified leaves into spines, phylloclades and cladodes, and metabolic alterations in metabolisms of sugars, amino acids, plant hormones and large number of secondary metabolites have been documented in desert plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Miranda1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Couso1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Sardans1">[19]</xref>. However, the role of allelopathy or secondary metabolites in overcoming arid conditions, in conjunction with their allelopathic behavior, is still poorly understood. On the other hand, our current understanding of allelopathy has been successfully used to control weed populations via methods involving crop rotation, mixed cropping and essential oils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Schulz1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The concept of allelopathy is still a matter of controversy and its study is plagued with methodological problems, particularly regarding the distinction between allelopathy and competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Couso1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Muller1">[21]</xref>. An extensive literature survey shows a paucity of information on the role of allelochemicals in plant survival in arid and semiarid conditions in combination with allelopathy. The present study focused on three wild perennial species: <italic>Origanum dayi post</italic>, <italic>Artemisia sieberi</italic> and <italic>Artemisia judaica,</italic> growing in arid and semiarid regions of Israel.</p>
<p>Among these three wild species, <italic>O. dayi</italic> is a small shrub that is endemic to Israel, growing in the northern and western Negev desert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai1">[22]</xref> and in the Judea desert at altitudes of 300 m below sea level to 600 m above sea level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Danin1">[23]</xref>. <italic>O. dayi</italic> was domesticated and a selected cultivar is grown as an agricultural crop in Kibbutz Urim in the northern Negev for essential-oil production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Larkov1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>A. sieberi</italic> is a perennial small shrub of Irano-Turanian phytogeographical origin with a wide distribution in the Mediterranean and Middle East, particularly Iran, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Spain and Cyprus and extending into central Asia up to the Himalayan Mountains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Mohamed1">[26]</xref>. Essential oil and secondary metabolites obtained from <italic>A. sieberi</italic> have antioxidant, anti-venom, anti-bacterial, anti-spasmodic, neurological and hypoglycemic activities, exhibit cytotoxicity and gene induction, and have toxic effects on reproduction as well as pesticidal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Mohamed1">[26]</xref>. Allelopathic effects of <italic>A. sieberi</italic> have a strong impact on plant growth in the wild and on seed germination in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Escudero1">[27]</xref>, and its essential oil has been used in biological weed control.</p>
<p><italic>A. judaica</italic> is a perennial shrub with small silver-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that appears in March–April. It grows in desert wadi beds in the eastern Sahara–Libya and Egypt, and in the southwestern regions of the Middle East–Sinai, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In Israel, <italic>A. judaica</italic> can be found along the Paaran wadi and in the Arava valley from altitudes of 500 m above sea level to 340 m below sea level. In Sinai, the plants can be found at altitudes ranging from 1,600 m above sea level down to the coastal plains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Putievsky1">[28]</xref>. Similar to some other desert <italic>Artemisia</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Feuerstein1">[29]</xref>, <italic>A. judaica</italic> is strongly aromatic, and is commonly used by the local population for medicinal purposes, such as for gastrointestinal disorders, snake and scorpion bites, ear infections, dysentery, coughing and external wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Putievsky1">[28]</xref>. The Israeli population of <italic>A. judaica</italic> was separated from the Sinai population, creating two distinct chemotypes which reflect genetic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Fleisher1">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, the Negev chemotype is of the artemisyl-oil type, characterized by the existence of artemisyl-skeleton-type compounds in the essential oil; the Sinai chemotype is of the piperitone-oil type, characterized by the absence of artemisyl-skeleton-type compounds and the presence of a relatively high percentage of piperitone and camphor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Putievsky1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Fleisher1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Ravid1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Soleiman1">[32]</xref>. In addition, it has been reported that the essential oil of <italic>A. judaica</italic> can strongly inhibit the germination of annual plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai3">[33]</xref>, suggesting use of these allelochemicals for weed control in agriculture.</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying the survival of desert plants under harsh conditions is not fully known; the present study attempts to elucidate the role of allelochemicals in these species’ survival, and the allelopathic effects of natural compounds released from these species on neighboring plants growing under arid and semiarid conditions. Knowledge gained from the current study will be helpful in understanding the role of allelopathy in desert plants. To explore its role in plant survival under arid and semiarid conditions, extensive morphological, physiological, metabolomic and allelopathic analyses were carried out. The four (summer, spring, winter and autumn) seasons were surveyed separately to study the participation of allelochemicals in allelopathy and survival of desert plants.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Plant Materials</title>
<p>Three wild species–<italic>Origanum dayi</italic> Post (family Lamiaceae), <italic>Artemisia sieberi</italic> and <italic>Artemisia judaica</italic> (family Compositae)–were used in the present study.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Growth Conditions</title>
<p>The plants were grown in a greenhouse under standard conditions for 3 months (February to May 2009). The conditions in the greenhouse were: temperature held constant at 20°C (day) and 15°C (night) and relative air humidity kept at 70%. Plants were arranged randomly in different pots in the greenhouse. After 3 months, they were transplanted into the field. From September 2009, the field was divided into nine plots and irrigation regime was calculated by the “Penman equation” using data from the meteorological station located in Sede-Boker:</p>
<p>The irrigation amount was calculated by multiplying the weekly average evaporated water by a crop factor which was correlated to the amount of plant cover. The optimal plant nutrition was supplied equally to all treatments by applying compost at the beginning of the growing season and slow-release fertilizer (Multigan N:P:K 20∶11∶16 Ekogan®) at the base of the plants once every four months. The water conditions in the soil were maintained similar to produce natural conditions having high water content in winter seasons and low water in the summer season as per data provided by meteorological station located in Sede-Boker.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Physiological Parameters</title>
<p>The following plant physiological stress indicators were measured once a season (four times in total) during the experimental period (autumn–September 2009, winter–January 2010, spring–April 2010 and summer–July 2010).</p>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>Growth rate</title>
<p>Growth rate was measured by foliage maximum and minimum diameter and plant’s maximum height. The measurement was taken in six replicates–each replicate sampled from a different plant from the seedling and cutting populations.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c2">
<title>Leaf relative water content (RWC)</title>
<p>Fresh leaf samples (3–10 g) were weighed and soaked in tap water for 24 h until fully turgid. Samples were then reweighed (turgid weight), dried for 48 h at 65°C and weighed again after removal from the oven.</p>
<p>The measurements were taken in six replicates with each replicate sampled from a different plant from the cutting population.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c3">
<title>Osmolarity</title>
<p>Small segments of fully expanded leaves were macerated in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder. Then 200 µl of double-distilled water was mixed with the crushed leaves to make liquid extract, followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 7500 g. Then, 10 µl of centrifugate was utilized to determine the osmolarity in a pressure osmometer (Vapro® 5520, Wescor, CITY, STATE, USA).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c4">
<title>Soil water content</title>
<p>Soil water content was measured in two seasons (winter and summer) reflecting significant changes in soil among seasons. The measurements were carried out twice: winter (January 2010) and summer (July 2010). In brief, about 500 g of soil was collected from rhizospheric zone of each plot in four locations: near the plant base on the surface and at 20 cm depth, and 40 cm from the plant base on the surface and at 20 cm depth in respective seasons. Water content was determined by weighing a sample of the soil (fresh weight), oven-drying for 48 h at 65°C and then reweighing (dry weight).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c5">
<title>Photochemical activity</title>
<p>A portable fluorometer (pulse-amplitude-modulated photosynthesis yield analyzer, Mini-PAM; Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) was used to measure chlorophyll fluorescence of the leaves in the field. This instrument was used to measure effective quantum yield (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m’</sub>), calculated as the ratio of F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>, where <italic>F</italic> is the fluorescence yield of the light-adapted sample and <italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub>(maximum fluorescence) is the maximum light-adapted fluorescence yield when a saturating light pulse of 800 ms duration (intensity = 3,000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) is superimposed on the prevailing environmental light levels. The measurements were tested in six replicates–each replicate was sampled from a different plant from the cutting population.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Determination of Volatile Composition</title>
<p>For the determination of the volatile composition, leaves positioned in the middle of the plant stem and soil samples taken from the rhizosphere zone of the plants, 5 cm belowground were collected and extracted with either organic solvents or water.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title>Extractions in organic solvent</title>
<p>Samples of the leaves or soils were extracted in hermetically sealed 20-ml scintillation vials for 24 h by gentle shaking with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (99.8%) (Bio-Lab, Israel) containing 10 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> isobutyl benzene (Sigma-Aldrich, Israel) as a internal standard at room temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai1">[22]</xref>. The sample-to-solvent ratio was 1 g per 10 ml in the case of plant extraction and 2 g per 10 ml in the case of soil extraction. The extracts were purified by passing through a Pasteur pipette containing anhydrous sodium sulfate (Merck, Israel) and Silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh; Merck, Israel) to dry and filter the water and other polar compounds with high molecular weight (such as chlorophyll) that might interfere with the GC-MS analyses. Purified samples were collected into 2-ml Teflon-covered glass vials and injected into the GC-MS system for analysis. The measurement was performed in six replicates, with each replicate consisting of samples from a different plant population–both cuttings and seedlings–in the autumn (September), and only from the cutting population in the winter (January), spring (April) and summer (July).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d2">
<title>Hydrodistillation</title>
<p>Fresh leaf samples (250 g) were hydrodistilled for 1.5 h in a modified Clevenger apparatus at Newe Ya’ar Research Center as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai4">[34]</xref>. The essential oil was cooled, separated from the water and analyzed by GC-MS.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d3">
<title>Solid-phase microextraction (SPME)</title>
<p>SPME was used to ascertain the effect of the plants under study on the surrounding atmospheric and soil conditions. About 20 ml of open vial, 15 vials for each species, were exposed for 6 h, from 0800 to 1400 h, in the summer in the open air, 5 cm aboveground at the plant base. The vials were then sealed and SPME injection needle was inserted manually through the septum into the vial. The headspace volatiles were adsorbed onto the polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene-coated 65 mm SPME fiber for 30 min at ambient temperature and desorbed for 10 min into the GC-MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) apparatus injector liner.</p>
<p>Separation and identification of volatile components was performed by GC-MS at the Newe Ya’ar Research Center. The SPME samples or 1 µl of the extract or diluted distillate was analyzed in a GC-MSD equipped with a mass-selection −5973 network (electron ionization 70 eV) detector (Agilent Technologies). The GC-MS was equipped with a capillary column, Rtx-5Sil MS (Restek Corporation, State College, PA, USA) (30 m×0.25 mm) i.d×0.25 µm silica. The carrier gas was helium (He) at a constant flow of 1 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. The extraction samples were introduced into the column in ‘splitless’ mode, while the oil and SPME samples were introduced in ‘split’ mode at a ratio of 1∶50. Temperatures were set as follows: injector temperature 250°C, transfer line and detector 280°C. The column temperature gradient was set as follows: 50°C for 1 min, addition of 5°C min<sup>−1</sup> to 260°C and held at 260°C for 10 min. Component recognition was based on a comparison of the components’ retention time index (RI) to commercial standards and of the samples’ mass spectrum with GC-MS libraries (Adams 2001, NIST 98, and QuadLib 1607).</p>

<title>Determination of Allelopathic Effects</title>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Allelopathic effects in the field</title>
<p>Allelopathic effects on the weed growth in the field were monitored in the spring by systematically identifying weeds, counting the number of weeds in the different botanical families, collecting them, oven-drying them for 48 h at 105°C and weighing the total biomass. A second round of weed monitoring was carried out in the summer of 2010 when only total biomass was measured.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e2">
<title>Allelopathic effects of the essential oil: in-vitro experiment</title>
<p>Germination inhibition by different amounts of essential oil was examined in the lab under controlled conditions. Wheat seeds (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) were germinated in 20- ml scintillation vials on three layers of Whatman no. 1 filter paper wetted with 1.5 ml distilled water. Vials containing 10 seeds were incubated in the dark at 27°C. To determine the inhibitory effect of an essential oil, five different essential oil quantities: 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 µl, as well as blank controls (no essential oil) were tested. The essential oil, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai1">[22]</xref>, was loaded (using a calibrated glass microcapillary) on a piece of filter paper attached by double-sided adhesive tape to the inner side of the vial cover. Each amount of essential oil was tested in five replicates. After incubation, the number of germinated seeds was counted.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e3">
<title>Allelopathic effects of the soil: in-vivo experiment</title>
<p>This was performed following the methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Wu1">[35]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Reinhardt1">[36]</xref>. In brief, wheat seeds were germinated in 6-cm diameter petri dishes containing 4 g of soil taken from the field. The soil was collected from the upper 1 cm layer, within a 10-cm radius of the plant base, from three well-irrigated plots–one of each species. About 4 ml of distilled water was added and 10 seeds were placed on the wet soil. The petri dishes were incubated in the dark at 27°C for 48 h. As a control, soil from an empty plot in the field was used. Each treatment was tested in five replicates. After incubation, the numbers of germinated seeds were counted.</p>

<title>Principal Component Analyses (PCA)</title>
<p>PCA is widely used to determine the effects of variables (heat, drought, salinity and other abiotic or biotic stresses) on other selected variables (plant height, yield and the like). In the present investigation, PCA was used to determine the effects of seasonal variations on metabolite production in <italic>O. dayi</italic>, <italic>A. sieberi</italic> and <italic>A. judaica</italic>. Extensive application of PCA can help elucidate the impact of seasonal changes on metabolite production and can also reveal the water-stress-tolerance potential of the species under study. In addition, PCA can be a useful way of describing the significant changes in metabolite production in the different seasons.</p>

<p>The irrigation treatments were given only for a period of less than two months i.e. from the beginning of the September 2009, to end of October, 2009 (autumn) of all the plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The winter rains started at the end of the October and lasted until the end of March 2010. During this span of five months rainy season the amount of precipitation in the study area–Sede Boker–was 154.6 mm (source Sede-Boker Meteorological station), which was over 50% of the annual mean precipitation. The raining season was followed by a non-raining summer of 2010 (five months of dry period) producing drought conditions in the soil. The field capacity includes a volumetric water content of 25%. We observed a significant decrease (P&lt;0.05) in water content of the soil among summer and winter seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, such that it was significantly lower in summer.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Allelopathy is a well-studied phenomenon in which chemicals released by one plant may have detrimental or inhibitory effects on the germination, seedling establishment or growth pattern of neighboring plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Weston1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Miranda1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Couso1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Sardans1">[19]</xref>. In fact, allelochemicals produced by plants serve many purposes aside from being active in allelopathy, such as avoidance of herbivory and reducing competition for light, water and other micro- and macronutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Uesugi1">[37]</xref>. Desert plants have been known to survive drought periods more successfully than mesophytes and other terrestrial plant groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Miranda1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Couso1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Sardans1">[19]</xref>. However, the role of secondary metabolites in the survival of desert plants in conjunction with allelopathy has never been explored, and offers a new research vista. The present study was therefore performed to elucidate the role of alleochemicals in survival under arid or semiarid desert conditions and in allelopathy, with a major focus on the botanical use of plant extracts for weed control. Our findings are the first to report a role for allelopathy in the successful survival of desert plants with agronomical use of plant extracts of the species under study to handle weed problems.</p>

<title>Allelopathy and Water Stress</title>
<p>The plants under study were grown under natural conditions with no surplus water provided, replicating their natural habitat niche. Significant amounts of soil water content were noted in winter vs. summer soils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). These seasonal changes in soil water content can be linked to less evapotranspiration in the winter than in the summer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Xu1">[2]</xref>. Differences were expected in the composition and content of metabolites identified in the three species facing the four different seasonal regimes. Seasonal variations were found to have a significant impact on composition and content of specific metabolites that are held responsible for allelopathy (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s004">Tables S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s006">S3</xref></bold>). The concentrations of these metabolites differed significantly across the three analyzed samples, i.e. in the plant foliage, soil and air (discussed further on) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t001"><bold>Tables 1</bold></xref><bold>–</bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t003"><bold>3</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Plant growth (height and stem diameter) was differentially affected across the three species in the four seasons, with most of the growth changes in all three studied species observed in the autumn and winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g002"><bold>Figures 2</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g003"><bold>3</bold></xref>).

These seasonal changes were also found to significantly affect the osmolarities of all the three species, albeit differentially (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).

<title>Influence of Allelopathic Abilities on Weed Populations</title>
<p>All three species showed allelopathic abilities in the laboratory experiments with respect to germination inhibition by essential oils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref><bold> upper panel</bold>) and by soils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref><bold> lower panel</bold>). This enabled us to conclude that allelopathic inhibition can be caused by volatiles in the air (as reflected by the essential oil germination inhibition experiment), inhibitory components in the soil (as seen in the soil germination inhibition experiment) or a combination of air- and soilborne allelopathic factors. The latter case may be supported by the presence of compounds in the plant’s atmosphere in both the field and the soil in which the plants grew (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t001"><bold>Tables</bold> <bold>1</bold></xref><bold>–</bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t003"><bold>3</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The allelopathic tendencies of the genus <italic>Artemisia</italic> have been well demonstrated.

<p>An extensive literature survey showed no previous information on the allelopathic abilities of <italic>O. dayi</italic>, whereas other species of this genus, such as <italic>O. syriacum, O. vulgare,</italic> and <italic>O. majorana</italic>, are known to possess low germination-inhibition abilities relative to other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Dudai3">[33]</xref>. In the present study, the highest levels of germination inhibition at lowest concentration applied (0.5 µl) were obtained with the essential oil from <italic>O. dayi</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sieberi</italic> <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref> <bold>upper panel)</bold> and with <italic>O. dayi</italic> in soil induced germination inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref> <bold>lower panel)</bold>.

<p>Specificity of allelopathic effects was noted in <italic>A. judaica</italic> plots, which showed the largest differences between the weed varieties growing in their plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>). The highest number of weeds affected by <italic>A. judaica</italic> belonged to the <italic>Papilonaceae</italic>, whereas in <italic>A. sieberi</italic> plots, the highest number of affected weeds belonged to the <italic>Chenopodiaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>).

<title>Metabolites and Allelopathy in <italic>O. Dayi</italic>, <italic>A. Sieberi</italic> and <italic>A. Judaica</italic></title>
<p>Among the metabolites identified in <italic>O. dayi</italic>, 1,8-cyneole was present at the highest concentration in solvent, soil and air samples, indicating its abundance in and around the plant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). On the other hand, compounds like α-terpineol, α-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, linalyl acetate and cis-sabinene hydrate were present at high concentrations in the solvent and the air around the foliage, but were absent or at low concentrations in the soil samples. Interestingly, limonene content in the soil sample was 100-fold than that in the solvent sample, and this compound was entirely absent in the air sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). The high concentration of limonene in the soil suggests a crucial role in allelopathic effects such as inhibition of seed germination and seedling establishment.</p>
<p>The concentration of compounds released by <italic>A. sieberi</italic> and its allelopathic effects were also correlated. 1,8-Cineole and camphor were present in great abundance in all three samples analyzed, i.e. plant foliage, soil and air (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Trans-thujone and α-pinene were present at higher concentrations in the soil and air samples than in the foliage sample, indicating their significant role in allelopathic effects. The concentration of limonene found in the soil sample was much higher than in the foliage or soil samples, thereby indicating its role in producing allelopathic effects on plants growing in <italic>A. sieberi</italic>’s vicinity. In contrast, α-tujene was present in high abundance in air samples relative to soil and foliage samples. A high concentration of α-tujene might be responsible for this plant’s airborne allelopathic effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The allelopathic effects of <italic>A. judaica</italic> were regulated by a large number of natural compounds released by the plants, some of them residing in the plant tissue–leaves, stem and roots–and others passed into the soil and air to regulate allelopathic reactions occurring there. Among the metabolites identified in <italic>A. judaica</italic>, artemisia ketone and ethyl cinnamate were present in the foliage, soil and air samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>); however, concentrations of these compounds were much higher in the soil and air samples than in the plant sample. The concentration of filifolide A was much higher in the soil sample than in the plant or air samples, suggesting this metabolite’s greater contribution to soil borne allelopathic effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081580-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Concentrations of chrysanthenone and sabiene were much higher in air samples than in soil and plant samples indicating their important role in allelopathic regulation of neighboring plants through inhibition of seed germination and seedling establishment.</p>

<title>Why do Desert Plants Thrive under Arid and Semiarid Conditions?</title>
<p>Extensive GC-MS analyses of <italic>O. dayi</italic>, <italic>A. sieberi</italic> and <italic>A. judaica</italic> under the four seasonal regimes which differed in soil water level revealed some interesting facts. Although insignificant differences were found in the relative content of most of the metabolites identified under low soil water (summer) and high soil water (winter) regimes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s004">Tables S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s006">S3</xref></bold>). Only few metabolites showed significant increases in their relative content in the summer season (water deficit conditions) when compared to winter season (high soil water). This selective increase in the relative metabolite content may be associated with enabling plants under study to thrive efficiently under water deficit conditions. For instance elevated levels of linalyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, γ-terpinene, trans-sabinene hydrate and trans-sabinene hydrate acetate in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>dayi</italic>; 1,8-cineole, camphor, artemisia alcohol, borneol, germacrene D, camphene, para-cymene, trans-Sabinene hydrate, pinocarvone, jasmine ketolactone and α-Tujene in <italic>A. sieberi</italic>; ethyl cinnamate, borneol and piperitone in <italic>A. judaica</italic> were observed. Enhanced volatile content of only few metabolites among an array of metabolites suggested their selective induction during summer season over winter period. Such that five out of twenty seven in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>dayi</italic>; eleven out of twenty four in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sieberi</italic> and three out of seventeen metabolites in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>judaica</italic> were shown to be significantly enhanced under water deficit period during summer season, and this selective metabolomic shift may be responsible for improved plant growth and physiological attributes such as Fv/Fm which in turn may be involved in imparting drought resistance of plants under study (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s004">Tables S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081580.s006">S3</xref>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>This resistance to a major shift in metabolome content and composition with changing seasons might be a crucial factor in the successful survival of these plant species under harsh and changing environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Chon1">[44]</xref>. PCA led us to propose that <italic>O. dayi</italic> is more resistant to seasonal variations than <italic>A. sieberi</italic> or <italic>A. judaica</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081580-g010"><bold>Figure 10</bold></xref>). Metabolite production also did not vary significantly in the three species studied, indicating their potential to thrive under water stress without jeopardizing their metabolic regulation drastically. Furthermore maintenance of a threshold level of specific metabolites might be a key to the successful survival of these plant species under subtle changes in soil water status. Moreover, during the course of their evolution, these plant species have learned to maintain the homeostatic balance of natural compounds, enabling them to survive longer periods of drought and harsh environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081580-Chon1">[44]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The physiological conjunction of allelochemicals in desert plants and their role in plant survival during periods of low water state is shown for the first time. Our findings showed that water deficit condition is the driving force for metabolome shift in plants growing in arid or semi-arid soil conditions. Selective induction of few metabolites and keeping significant part of the metabolome unaffected by water deficit condition may be a key strategy for water stress management in the desert plants. Current study also suggests that homeostasis in the endogenous levels of natural compounds plays a crucial role in these species’ ability to thrive during periods of water stress. Findings also showed the participation of natural compounds in the allelopathic behavior of <italic>O. dayi</italic>, <italic>A. sieberi</italic> and <italic>A. judaica</italic>, which may serve as a basis for the generation of species-targeted herbicides. A detailed molecular insight of desert plants under water stress condition will be a great future endeavor.</p>
