<title>Background/Aims</title>
<p>Nephrotoxicity is a frequent and major limitation in cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is widely distributed in animal cells, and it is a precursor of tetrapyrole compounds such as heme that is fundamentally important in aerobic energy metabolism. The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective role of ALA in CDDP-induced acute kidney injury (AKI).</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Method</title>
<p>We used CDDP-induced AKI rat model and cultured renal tubular cells (NRK-52E). We divided four groups of rats: control, CDDP only, CDDP + ALA(post);(ALA 10 mg/kg + Fe in drinking water) after CDDP, CDDP + ALA(pre &amp; post).</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Result</title>
<p>CDDP increased Cr up to 6.5 mg/dl, BUN up to 230 mg/dl, and ALA significantly reduced these changes. ALA ameliorates CDDP-induced morphological renal damages, and reduced tubular apoptosis evaluated by TUNEL staining and cleaved caspase 3. Protein and mRNA levels of ATP5α, complex(COX) IV, UCP2, PGC-1α in renal tissue were significantly decreased by CDDP, and ALA ameliorates reduction of these enzymes. In contrast, Heme Oxigenase (HO)-1 level is induced by CDDP treatment, and ALA treatment further up-regulates HO-1 levels. In NRK-52E cells, the CDDP-induced reduction of protein and mRNA levels of mitochondrial enzymes was significantly recovered by ALA + Fe. CDDP-induced apoptosis were ameliorated by ALA + Fe treatment. Furthermore, we evaluated the size of transplantated bladder carcinoma to the rat skin, and ALA did not change the anti cancer effects of CDDP.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These data suggested that the protective role of ALA in cisplatin-induced AKI is via protection of mitochondrial viability and prevents tubular apoptosis. Also there are no significant effects of ALA on anticancer efficiency of CDDP in rats. Thus, ALA has the potential to prevent CDDP nephrotoxicity without compromising its anticancer efficacy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cisplatin is one of the most effective and potent anticancer drugs in the treatment of epithelial malignancies such as lung, head and neck, ovarian, bladder, and testicular cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Boulikas1">[1]</xref>. The major constraint to cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the frequent development of nephrotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Arany1">[2]</xref>. The antineoplastic effect of cisplatin is dose dependent, yet the risk of nephrotoxicity often precludes the use of higher doses to maximize the therapeutic effect. Cisplatin induces apoptosis of renal proximal tubule cells (LLC-PK1) in vitro by means of mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Park1">[3]</xref>, partly through the activation of caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kaushal1">[4]</xref>. Oxidant stress also appears to contribute to the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells, both in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Zhou1">[5]</xref>. Several studies, including ours, suggest that caspase inhibitors and knockout of apoptosis-related genes attenuate cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kuwana1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Terada1">[7]</xref>. Mitochondria have a variety of important intracellular functions, including ATP production, synthesis of reactive oxygen species, and regulation of the cell death pathway. Recent studies, including ours, have demonstrated that mitochondrial function is one of the key factors protecting cells from oxidative stress in AKI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Hall1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ishihara1">[9]</xref>. Changes in mitochondrial structure and membrane potential were reported in the proximal tubules during AKI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Hall1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ishihara1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the naturally occurring metabolic precursor of an endogenously synthesized photosensitizer, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kobuchi1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Inoue1">[12]</xref>. ALA is widely distributed in animal cells, and it is a precursor of tetrapyrole compounds such as heme, which is fundamentally important in aerobic energy metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ishizuka1">[13]</xref>. Here, we explored the relevance of ALA in protecting renal tubular cells in cisplatin-treated rats through the attenuation of mitochondrial enzymes and the apoptotic pathway. Thus, ALA has the potential to prevent cisplatin nephrotoxicity without compromising the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin. This study was conducted to determine whether ALA affects the course of cisplatin-induced AKI. To achieve this, we examined differences in the renal function, histology, changes of mitochondrial enzymes, and tubular cell apoptosis in cisplatin-induced AKI. Our data demonstrated that ALA has the potential to prevent cisplatin nephrotoxicity without compromising the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin.</p>

<title>Induction of cisplatin-induced AKI</title>
<p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Saitama Experimental Animal Supply, Saitama, Japan) weighing 150–200 g were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). Cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in saline at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of either a vehicle (saline) or cisplatin (8 mg/kg body weight). 5-ALA 10 mg/kg + Fe (sodium ferrous citrate, 15.7 mg/kg) dissolved in drinking water were administered to rats. 5-ALA (COSMO BIO co., ltd. Tokyo, Japan), and sodium ferrous citrate (kindly provided by SBI Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were prepared. 5-ALA and Fe were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The animals were divided into 4 subgroups: (1) a control (saline) group, (2) a cisplatin group, (3) an ALA-treated post-cisplatin-injection group (post), and (4) an ALA-treated pre- and post-cisplatin-injection group (pre &amp; post) (n = 8 for each group). The blood was obtained via tail vein at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after cisplatin injection. The rats were killed at 5 and 9 days after surgery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080850.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The left kidney was rapidly removed and processed for histological evaluation, protein extraction, and RNA extraction at day 5 and 9 as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Terada2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Tanaka1">[15]</xref>. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kochi (#20–027), and experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>

<title>Effects of ALA on the antitumorigenic effects of cisplatin</title>
<p>Male F344/NJcl-rnu/rnu rats (immunodeficiency rats) (Saitama Experimental Animal Supply) weighing 150–200 g were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). 253J-BV (a bladder carcinoma cell line) cells (2×10<sup>7</sup>) originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) were subcutaneously injected into the skin of the back. The rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of either a vehicle (saline) or cisplatin (8 mg/kg body weight). 5-ALA 10 mg/kg + Fe (sodium ferrous citrate, 15.7 mg/kg) dissolved in drinking water were administered to rats. The animals were divided into 4 subgroups: (1) a control (saline) group, (2) a cisplatin group, (3) an ALA-treated post-cisplatin-injection group (post), and (4) an ALA-treated pre- and post-cisplatin-injection group (pre &amp; post) (n = 5 for each group). The volume of the carcinoma was measured at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after surgery.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>NRK-52E cells (renal tubular cells from adult rats), originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA) supplemented with 50 IU/mL penicillin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Tanaka1">[15]</xref>. For the cisplatin experiments, cisplatin (20 μM) was added to the NRK-52E cells for 24 h. For the ALA + cisplatin experiments, 200 μM 5-ALA, 100 μM sodium ferrous citrate, and 20 μM cisplatin were added to the NRK-52E cells for 24 h. All other chemicals were purchased from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Isolation and histological examination of kidney tissue</title>
<p>Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital at the indicated times after cisplatin administration. The kidneys were perfused in situ with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the left kidney was then rapidly excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in SDS sample buffer, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kobayashi1">[16]</xref>. For immunohistochemical studies, kidneys were fixed in formalin overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Thin sections were cut and subjected to periodic acid-Schiff staining, as described previously. Tubular injury was assessed by using a semiquantitative scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kuwana1">[6]</xref>. Histological changes due to tubular necrosis were quantitated by determining the percentage of tubules with evident cell necrosis, loss of brush border, cast formation, and tubule dilatation, as follows: 0 =  none, 1 = ≤10%, 2 = 11%–25%, 3 = 26%–45%, 4 = 46%–75%, and 5 = ≤76%. At least 5–10 fields (×200) were reviewed for each slide. The Apoptosis TUNEL Kit II (MBL, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the staining of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kuwana1">[6]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Protein extracts of the total renal tissue or NRK-52E cells (50 μg samples) were prepared and denatured by heating at 100°C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Terada3">[17]</xref>. The proteins were separated on 7.5% or 10%–20% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% (wt/vol) fat-free milk in PBS and probed with the appropriate primary antibodies (anti-ATP5α, anti-complex [COX]-IV, anti-PGC-1α, anti-UCP2, anti-nitrotyrosine [anti-NT], anti-procaspase-3, or anti-actin [Santa Cruz Biochemicals Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA]). The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG or HRP-donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and visualized by using the Amersham ECL system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL, USA).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Measurements of heme</title>
<p>We measured heme to evaluate the metabolic product of ALA using assay kit (BioChain Institute, Newark, CA). Heme Assay Kit is based on an improved aqueous alkaline solution method, in which the heme is converted into a uniform colored form. The intensity of color, measured at 400 nm, is directly proportional to the heme concentration in the sample. We measured the renal tissue extract in the in vivo experiments, and the cell extracts in the in vivo experiments. The protein extracts of the total renal tissue or NRK-52E cells (100 μg samples) were prepared following the same method used in the immunoblot analysis.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of RNA extracted from kidneys was carried out as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kobayashi1">[16]</xref>. In brief, total RNA was isolated from renal tissues by using TRI Reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Samples of total RNA (1 μg) were reverse transcribed, and real-time qPCR was performed to quantify changes in <italic>ATP5</italic>α, <italic>COX-IV</italic>, <italic>PGC-1</italic>α, and <italic>UCP2</italic> gene expression by using the ABI LightCycler real-time PCR system (ABI, Los Angeles, CA, USA). RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a positive control. A 3-step PCR was performed for 35 cycles. The samples were denatured at 94°C for 30 s, annealed at 58°C for 30 s, and extended at 72°C for 30 s. The primers were obtained from ABI.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial morphology obtained by using laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>NRK-52E cells were stained with MitoTracker mitochondrion-selective probes (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD, USA). For confocal microscopy, NRK-52E cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h and processed for imaging as described previously, and examined under a confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss Japan, Tokyo, Japan) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Tanabe1">[18]</xref>. Fragmented mitochondria were condensed and punctate, whereas normal mitochondria showed a threadlike or rounded structure.

<title>5-Aminolevulinic acid protects from cisplatin-induced renal injury</title>
<p>Cisplatin increased the serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in comparison with the controls at days 5–9. ALA treatments (both post and pre &amp; post) significantly prevented these changes in cisplatin-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Body weight was not significantly different in rats before the beginning of the treatment. Cisplatin reduced body weight gain in the test animals. ALA treatments (both post and pre &amp; post) significantly prevented, but did not normalize, cisplatin-induced weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The toxic effect of cisplatin was also confirmed by the detection of morphologic abnormalities in kidney slices. The histology results for the control rats were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The cisplatin group exhibited acute structural damage characterized by tubular necrosis, swelling and tubular dilation, extensive epithelial vacuolization, and hyaline casts in renal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g002">Figure 2B–D</xref>). ALA reduced these tubular damages in cisplatin-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>). The semiquantitative histological injury score was significantly higher in cisplatin-treated rats than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>5-Aminolevulinic acid ameliorates cisplatin-induced reduction of mRNA and protein expression of mitochondria-related genes in vivo</title>
<p>We next examined whether ALA protects the mitochondrial enzymes from cisplatin injury. Because previous studies demonstrated that cisplatin caused a marked decrease in the expression of several mitochondrial enzymes, we examined typical enzymes (ATP5α, COX-IV, PGC-1α, and UCP2) in cisplatin-treated, control, and cisplatin + ALA–treated rats. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, cisplatin induced a significant loss of ATP5α, COX-IV, PGC-1α, and UCP2 protein expression. ALA treatment (both post and pre &amp; post) recovered the cisplatin-induced decreases of ATP5α, COX-IV, PGC-1α, and UCP2 protein expression. Quantitative analysis revealed that cisplatin induced decreases of ATP5α, COX-IV, PGC-1α, and UCP2 protein expression, and these reductions were ameliorated by ALA treatments (both pre and pre &amp; post) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, to examine the changes in the expression of these enzymes during cisplatin-induced AKI, we conducted an RT-PCR analysis of rat renal tissue mRNA.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the protective role of ALA in cisplatin-induced AKI is through the protection of mitochondrial viability, and ALA prevents tubular apoptosis. In addition, ALA has no significant effects on the anticancer efficiency of cisplatin in rats. Thus, ALA has the potential to prevent cisplatin nephrotoxicity without compromising the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin. Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used in the treatment of a variety of solid-organ cancers, including those of the head, neck, testis, ovary, and breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Lebwohl1">[19]</xref>. Unfortunately, in addition to causing bone marrow suppression, ototoxicity, and anaphylaxis, around 30% of patients receiving cisplatin develop AKI owing to its preferential accumulation within the proximal tubule cells in the outer medulla of the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ries1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Safirstein1">[21]</xref>. The cellular events in cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity, including decreased protein synthesis, membrane peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA injury, are a consequence of free radical generation and the body's inability to scavenge such molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Brady1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Lau1">[23]</xref>. Consistent with previous studies, we found that cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction and morphological changes were associated with mitochondrial injury in the rat kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ishihara1">[9]</xref>. These findings were also confirmed by using NRK-52E cells, in which we documented that cisplatin caused mitochondrial fragmentation and decrease of mitochondrial enzymes.</p>
<p>In animal cells, ALA is formed from glycine and succinyl CoA by ALA synthase in mitochondria. COX and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> are hemoproteins. In this study, we demonstrated that COX-IV expression was increased by ALA administration in vivo and in vitro. This finding is in accordance with previous report with liver lysates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ogura1">[24]</xref>. ALA is the precursor of protoporphyrin, and heme is produced by the insertion of iron. Therefore, ALA administration can result in heme production in the rat kidney, and it is possible that COX-IV was increased by ALA administration. ALA administration upregulates HO-1 expression. HO-1 is a key enzyme for antioxidant response in renal tubular cells and therefore protects mitochondrial function and upregulates mitochondrial enzymes. We first demonstrated that typical mitochondrial enzymes, such as PGC-1α, UCP2, and ATP5α, were upregulated by ALA administration. Interestingly, ALA and Fe strongly induced these enzymes.</p>
<p>This is the first study to demonstrate that HO-1 is upregulated by ALA and Fe in vivo and in vitro. HO-1 a microsomal enzyme involved in the degradation of heme, resulting in the generation of biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide. Recent attention has focused on the biological effects of product(s) of this enzymatic reaction that have important antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Agarwal1">[25]</xref>. Induction of HO-1 occurs as an adaptive and beneficial response to a wide variety of oxidant stimuli, including heme, hydrogen peroxide, cytokines, growth factors, heavy metals, nitric oxide, and oxidized LDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Agarwal1">[25]</xref>. HO-1, the enzyme that is responsible for heme degradation, is upregulated in the proximal tubule cells in response to oxidant stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Nath1">[26]</xref>, and once induced, it confers dramatic cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Agarwal1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Nath2">[27]</xref>. The mechanisms of HO-1 regulation are reported by several pathways: one is hypoxia and inflammatory signals, including IL-1 and TNFα, and second are the nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and heme levels. HO-1 gene regulation is reported to involve Kelch-like enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap1) regulation through antioxidant response elements (ARE), Nrf2, and their binding in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Abraham1">[28]</xref>. Recently, investigators identified a heme-dependent degradation system involving iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) as a sensor of iron metabolism. IRP2 upregulates intracellular free iron and modulates intracellular iron stores, and increased iron efflux has been suggested as a mechanism for the cytoprotective effects of HO-1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ferris1">[29]</xref>. We clearly demonstrated that cisplatin itself upregulates HO-1 expression; these findings were in accordance with those of the previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Shiraishi1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Salahudeen1">[31]</xref>. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ALA induced HO-1 and ALA + Fe additively upregulated HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in NRK-52E cells. The additional induction of HO-1 by Fe may confer cytoprotective and antioxidant responses in renal tubular cells and protect mitochondrial function and enzymes such as PGC-1α, ATP5α, and UCP2. However, further studies are needed to completely clarify the mechanisms of heme regulation and their associated metabolic pathways concerning mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>No previous studies before ours have demonstrated the protective effects of ALA against cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Cisplatin induces apoptosis of renal proximal tubule cells (LLC-PK1) in vitro through mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Park1">[3]</xref>, partly through the activation of caspase-3 and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kaushal1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Zhou1">[5]</xref>. Several studies suggest that caspase inhibitors or knockout of apoptosis-related genes attenuate ischemia-induced AKI in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Daemen1">[32]</xref>. In our experiments, cisplatin administration induced apoptosis in vivo and vitro, as confirmed by TUNEL staining and cleaved caspase-3 level. Our data clearly demonstrated that ALA inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vivo and vitro, which was evaluated by examining the results of TUNEL staining and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Furthermore, ALA + Fe additionally reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NRK-52E cells. The plausible mechanisms of the ALA + Fe effects on antiapoptosis are antioxidative effects and protective effects toward mitochondria in renal tubular cells. In cancer cells, several studies suggested that ALA induces apoptosis through the accumulation of PpIX. ALA-mediated accumulation of PpIX causes photosensitization of cancer cells and is used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, oral cancer, and bladder carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Ishizuka1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Hagiya1">[33]</xref>. In several cancer cell lines, ABCG2 transporter is highly expressed and PpIX is accumulated in the cytosol and causes cytotoxic damage and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Kobuchi1">[10]</xref>. The mechanisms of the differential effects of ALA in the apoptotic pathway in normal renal tubular cells and carcinoma cells are not well known and need to be studied in future.</p>
<p>Cisplatin is one of the most effective and potent anticancer drugs in the treatment of epithelial malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080850-Boulikas1">[1]</xref>. Considering the clinical use of ALA in preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, it should be checked whether ALA interferes with the anticancer effects of cisplatin. Thus, we examined the effects of ALA on the size of the renal carcinoma transplanted into rat skin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080850-g010">Figure 10</xref>, cisplatin reduced the size of the transplanted renal carcinoma. ALA (post and pre &amp; post) did not change the anticancer effects of cisplatin. At least in our experimental condition, ALA did not interfere with the antitumorigenic effects of cisplatin in vivo. Further research is needed to gain insight into the effects of ALA on the anticancer effects of cisplatin before clinical use.</p>
<p>In summary, our study has produced 2 novel findings. First, the protective role of ALA in cisplatin-induced AKI is through the protection of mitochondrial viability, induction of HO-1, and prevention of tubular apoptosis. Second, ALA has no significant effects on the anticancer efficiency of cisplatin in rats and prevents tubular apoptosis. Further studies are necessary to gain a more precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which ALA protects renal cells against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.</p>

Rats were sacrificed at day 5 and 9, and renal tissue are obtained.</p>
