<abstract>
<p>Beta Catenin signaling is critical for the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is driven by multiple events, enhancing beta catenin stability and promoting its transcriptional co-activating function. We investigated the impact of BCR-ABL1 on Chibby1, a beta catenin antagonist involved in cell differentiation and transformation. Relative proximity of the Chibby1 encoding gene (C22<italic>orf</italic>2) on chromosome 22q12 to the BCR breakpoint (22q11) lets assume its involvement in beta catenin activation in chronic myeloid leukemia as a consequence of deletions of distal BCR sequences encompassing one C22<italic>orf</italic>2 allele. Forty patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were analyzed for C22<italic>orf</italic>2 relocation and Chibby1 expression. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses established that the entire C22<italic>orf</italic>2 follows BCR regardless of chromosomes involved in the translocation. In differentiated hematopoietic progenitors (bone marrow mononuclear cell fractions) of 30/40 patients, the expression of Chibby1 protein was reduced below 50% of the reference value (peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions of healthy persons). In such cell context, Chibby1 protein reduction is not dependent on C22<italic>orf</italic>2 transcriptional downmodulation; however, it is strictly dependent upon BCR-ABL1 expression because it was not observed at the moment of major molecular response under tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Moreover, it was not correlated with the disease prognosis or response to therapy. Most importantly, a remarkable Chibby1 reduction was apparent in a putative BCR-ABL1+ leukemic stem cell compartment identified by a CD34+ phenotype compared to more differentiated hematopoietic progenitors. In CD34+ cells, Chibby1 reduction arises from transcriptional events and is driven by C22<italic>orf</italic>2 promoter hypermethylation. These results advance low Chibby1 expression associated with BCR-ABL1 as a component of beta catenin signaling in leukemic stem cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is the causative genetic lesion of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Daley1">[1]</xref>. It originates from t(9;22)(q34;q11) reciprocal translocation with the breakpoint on chromosome 9 falling within a &gt;300 kb segment at the Abl 5′ end and the breakpoint on chromosome 22 within a 5.8 kb region spanning BCR exons 12–16 known as the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr). The resulting p210KDa chimeric protein has the ABL variable domain replaced by the first 902 or 927 amino acids of BCR, with the tetramer domain at the first exon-encoded N-terminus of BCR (encompassing amino acids 1 to 63) essential for converting inactive ABL into constitutively active BCR-ABL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-McWhirter1">[2]</xref>. Accordingly, the majority of CML patients undergo complete hematologic remission in response to the tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor imatinib (IM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Druker1">[3]</xref>. However, leukemic stem cells (LSC) are neither dependent on BCR-ABL1 TK activity for proliferation and survival nor killed by IM and second generation inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib; therefore, they provide a sanctuary for the disease relapse upon drug withdrawal and a putative source of drug-resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Hamilton1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Beta Catenin is a central component of self-renewal of BCR-ABL1+ LSC and reprogramming of committed granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) into LSC at the blast crisis (BC) onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Zhao1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Hu1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, it is involved in microenvironmental protection of CML stem and progenitor cells from TK inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Zhang1">[8]</xref>. Multiple events contribute to beta catenin stabilization in CML. They encompass the BCR-ABL1-mediated beta catenin phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues (Y86 and Y654), resulting in its impaired recruitment by the Axin/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b) destruction complex, BCR-ABL1-associated overexpression of growth arrest specific 2 (GAS2), reducing its degradation by the calpaine system, and GSK3b inactivation due to the prevalence of a GSK3b mis-spliced isoform unable to phosphorylate beta catenin and/or to GSK3b de-phosphorylation by the Fas associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Coluccia1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Huang2">[12]</xref>. Subsequently, beta catenin enters the nucleus to form a transcription complex with TCF/LEF factors and activates the expression of target genes, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Kim1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Chibby1 (Cby1) is a beta catenin antagonist encoded by C22<italic>orf</italic>2 on chromosome 22q12. Its nuclear interaction with the beta catenin C-terminal activation domain hampers beta catenin binding with TCF/LEF transcription factors, thereby repressing the target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Takemaru1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, Cby1 association with 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins ς and σ drives beta catenin nuclear export and cytoplasmatic relocation in a stable tripartite complex, attenuating beta catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Li1">[15]</xref>. Cby1 may, therefore, have a tumor suppressive function, and its down-regulation participate in cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, Cby1 downmodulation either due to C22<italic>orf</italic>2 loss or promoter hypermethylation is the most frequent genetic lesion in cranial pediatric ependymomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Karakoula1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The relative proximity of C22<italic>orf</italic>2 to the BCR breakpoint on chromosome 22q11 suggest its putative involvement in beta catenin activation in CML. In particular, the loss of one C22<italic>orf</italic>2 allele as a consequence of deletions of distal BCR sequences occurring at the time of Philadelphia translocation may cause the gene haploinsufficiency eventually associated with disease worse prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Sinclair1">[17]</xref>. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses performed on bone marrow cells of forty CML patients in chronic phase (CP) showed that the entire C22<italic>orf</italic>2 follows BCR and relocates to the derivative chromosome 9 (der (9q)) in patients with the typical t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation or to the second fusion gene in patients with variant translocations. Differentiated myeloid cells from bone marrow samples of thirty out of forty CML patients exhibited a reduction of Cby1 protein to less than half of reference values (healthy persons: HP), only in part dependent on transcriptional events. Cby1 reduction was not related to the disease risk according to Sokal score and with the response to TK inhibitors. At all instances, when present, it is a unique trait of clonal BCR-ABL1+ hematopoiesis because it was revoked at the moment of major molecular response (MMR) under TK inhibitor therapy. The most intriguing findings concern the significant reduction of Cby1 expression driven by the promoter hypermethylation in the putative LSC compartment identified by a CD34+ phenotype. The findings suggest that Cby1 is a component of beta catenin signaling, acting in concert with BCR-ABL1 to provide LSC an advantage over the normal counterpart.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>CML patients included in the study provided their written informed consent to be enrolled in clinical trials NCT00769327, NCT01535391 and NCT01061177 (ref clinicaltrials.gov) and to be evaluated for response to therapy with imatinib or nilotinib according to the study design. The above mentioned clinical trials were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi on July 15th 2008, September 13rd 2011 and June 29th 2010, respectively. Patients gave the written consent to the use of their bone marrow samples for genetic and laboratory biomarker analyses. Moreover, they gave verbal informed consent to participate in this particular study at the moment of their enrollment in the clinical trials, according to the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of the Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi. The verbal informed consent was properly mentioned in the medical record. Once collected, all samples were provided with an anonymous code number and stored following the recommendations of aforementioned trails. The samples from 8 healthy subjects were collected at the moment of hematopoietic stem cell harvest from peripheral blood following mobilization and intended for bone marrow transplantation. Participants were verbally informed and consented to the use of harvested sample residual fraction for this study. The verbal consent was registered in their medical records according to the consent procedures approved by the Ethical Committee of the Policlinico S.Orsola- Malpighi. All methods employed in this study were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Forty CML-CP patients were included in our study. Clinical details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s005">Table S1</xref>. In brief, all of them exhibited the BCR-ABL1 rearranged gene coding for p210 fusion protein and were treated with TK inhibitors (imatinib or nilotinib). Thirty two patients achieved a complete hematological response (CHR). All but one (35 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s005">Table S1</xref>) achieved a MMR (3 log reduction of BCR-ABL1 transcript level compared with that at diagnosis) within the 6th month or 1st year of therapy. The remaining eight patients had an insufficient follow-up for the evaluation of molecular response. Five patients were compared for Cby1 expression at diagnosis and at the moment of MMR. In 6 patients, Cby1 expression in mononuclear cell fractions (MCF), almost completely composed of differentiated myeloid progenitors, was compared with that of the putative LSC compartment identified by a CD34+ phenotype. Informed consent to report clinical details of patients and results of biomolecular analyses was preliminarily obtained according to protocols NCT00769327, NCT01535391, and NCT0161177 (see the above section for details).</p>

<title>Selection of Cells</title>
<p>Bone marrow samples from CML-CP patients and peripheral blood samples from HP were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque (Cederlane) density gradient centrifugation (1,000 g for 30′) to isolate MCF containing myeloid progenitors and more mature cells from red cells and plasma. Immunomagnetic selection (mini-MACS from Miltenyi Biotec) was used to purify CD34+ cells from MCF according to published method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Lemoli1">[18]</xref>. In brief, MCFs (1–5×10<sup>8</sup>/mL) were incubated at 4°C for 15′ with magnetic microbeads coated with anti-CD34 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec). Cell suspension was thereafter applied to a separation column placed in a magnetic field, which retains magnetically stained cells. After elution, cells were counted and assayed for their viability by the Trypan blue exclusion test. The recovery of CD34+ cells from MCF of CML-CP and HP was 0.29±0.11% and 0.17±0.03%, respectively. Cell purity was confirmed using flow cytometric analysis of anti-CD34-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences); it was &gt;90% in all cases (data not shown). Cytogenetic analysis confirmed previous findings, revealing the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome in 96.5±1.2% of CD34+ cell from CML-CP patients (data not shown).</p>

<title>Fluorescent in-situ Hybridization (FISH)</title>
<p>Dual color FISH for C22<italic>orf</italic>2 was performed on fixed metaphases using two different probes (RPI-199H16 22q12 from 37239655 to 37325154 and RPI-172B20 22q12 from 38345395 to 38559115 from Technogenetics). In brief, once placed on slides, probes were co-denatured at 75°C for 5 minutes and hybridized at 37°C overnight using Hybrite (Vysis). After washing in SSC 0.4X at 72°C for 2′ and SSC 2X+0.05% Igepal at room temperature for 30″, the slides were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and analyzed under a fluorescent microscope equipped with FITC/TRITC/AQUA/DAPI filter sets and Genikon imaging system software (Nikon Instruments). The LSI BCR/ABL tri-colour dual-fusion (DCDF) translocation probe (Vysis) was used to detect t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation in interphase or metaphase nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Testoni1">[19]</xref>.

<title>RNA and Protein Analysis</title>
<p>A commercial kit (SV total RNA Isolation System, Promega) was used for total RNA extraction starting from 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells. RNA was converted in cDNA using ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) in a 50 µl final-volume reaction mix comprising 2 µg of total RNA, 10 µl of reaction buffer (1×), 3 mM Mg2+, 0.5 mM dNTPs each, 0.5 µg of random hexamers, 1 U Recombinant RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor, and 160 U ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using the following program: 25°C for 5′, 40°C for 80′, and 75°C for 15′. PCR amplifications were performed with 1.25 U of Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Roche) in 30 µl of reaction buffer containing 0.4 µM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 500 ng of RT product. Thirty-two amplification cycles were performed after a 4′ denaturation step at 95°C, followed by a denaturation step at 95°C for 30″, a primer annealing step at 59°C (Cby1 and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M)) or 58°C (cyclin D1), and an elongation step at 72°C for 30″. The following primers were used: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- AGAGTCCTTGCTGGGGGTTCG-3′</named-content> (upper) and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- CTCCACCTCCCGGGTTGATCG-3′</named-content> (lower) to amplify the two isoforms (200 and 340 bp) of Cby1, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CCGCAATGACCCCGCACGAT-3′</named-content> (upper) and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCCTGGCGCCCTCAGATGTC-3′</named-content> (lower) to amplify cyclin D1 (442 bp), and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCT-3′</named-content> (upper) and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- TCACATGGTTCACACGGCAGGC-3′</named-content> (lower) for to amplify B2M (289 bp) as control for RT efficiency. The amplification products were resolved in 2% agarose gel, and signal intensities were measured using a dedicated software (IMAGEJ 1.44 p Launcher software from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Protein expression in whole cell lysates of MCF and CD34+ cells was evaluated using Western blot (WB) according to standard methods using a Cby1 antibody kindly purchased by K.I. Takemaru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Mancini1">[20]</xref>. To avoid individual differences in Cby1 expression, equal amounts of RNA and proteins from peripheral blood of 8 HP were pooled. The RNA and protein pool from HP was used in all experiments as control for PCR and WB from CML-CP patients. No differences in PCR and WB signal intensities obtained in 3–4 preliminary experiments, conducted in individual HP samples, did not exceed 10%. Preliminary experiments were conducted to exclude differences in Cby1 expression relative to the cell source, either bone marrow or peripheral blood (data not shown).</p>

<title>C22<italic>orf2</italic>, the Cby1-encoding Gene, follows BCR Sequences and Relocates to the der(9q) Chromosome</title>
<p>In 10%–18% of CML patients, the t(9;22) reciprocal translocation, which generates the BCR-ABL1 rearranged gene, is an unbalanced lesion where genomic sequences of either chromosome 9 or 22 may get lost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Sinclair1">[17]</xref>. Such deletions are adjacent to the t(9;22) breakpoint and may span several megabases of chromosomes 9 and 22. Several lines of evidence suggest that they are early events occurring at the time of translocation and producing a genetic heterogeneity <italic>ab initio</italic> associated with the disease prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Huntly1">[21]</xref>. The relative proximity of Cby1-encoding gene <italic>C22orf2</italic> (22q12) to the BCR breakpoint (22q11) suggests its BCR-ABL1-associated deletion as a putative component of beta catenin activation in CML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081425-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). FISH patterns of BCR/ABL1 and C22<italic>orf</italic>2 were investigated in MCF from bone marrow samples of CML-CP patients (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s005">Table S1</xref> for clinical details). FISH pattern in MCF from HP peripheral blood consists of two green and red signals, marking ABL on chromosomes 9 and BCR on chromosomes 22, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s001">Figure S1</xref>, panel A) All CML-CP patients with typical t(9;22) translocation displayed one BCR-ABL1 fusion signal at the Ph1 chromosome (22q-), one green signal corresponding to normal BCR at 22q and one red signal corresponding to normal ABL at the 9q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081425-g001">Figure 1B</xref>-panel A). The green signal corresponding to the BCR sequence was relocated to chromosome 1 in one patient exhibiting the t(1;9;22) variant translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081425-g001">Figure 1B</xref>-panel C relative to patient 9 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s005">Table S1</xref>). BCR relocation at a third chromosome was confirmed in the other two CML patients with variant translocations (patients 3 and 27 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s005">Table S1</xref>, data not shown). The C22<italic>orf</italic>2 probe used for FISH analyses encompasses the whole gene length with a green signal at the promoter origin and a red signal at the gene end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s001">Figure S1</xref>-panel B). In CML-CP patients with typical t(9;22) translocation, one pair of C22<italic>orf</italic>2 signals was translocated to der(9q) chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081425-g001">Figure 1B</xref>-panel B).

The salient result of our study concerns Cby1 downmodulation associated with BCR-ABL1+ as a component of beta catenin activation in LSC. Cby1 downmodulation is an intrinsic trait of more differentiated leukemic cells (bone marrow MCF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081425-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081425-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s006">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s007">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

Further investigation is in progress to elucidate the mechanisms involved in BCR-ABL1-associated reduced stability of Cby1 protein. Interestingly, Cby1 expression in more differentiated leukemic progenitors and mature myeloid precursors was not correlated with the disease prognosis or response to therapy, suggesting that in such cell compartments the impact of Cby1 expression on beta catenin signaling may be compensated by complementary signals affecting beta catenin stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s005">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081425.s006">S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Coluccia1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Huang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Huang2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081425-Neviani1">[48]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study provides evidence of reduced expression of the beta catenin antagonist, Cby1, associated with the BCR-ABL1 rearranged gene of CML. Cby1 reduction in a cell context encompassing more differentiated hematopoietic progenitors (bone marrow MCF) is neither dependent upon gene haploinsufficiency due to deletions of distal BCR sequences nor correlated with the disease stage at diagnosis or response to TK inhibitors. It most likely encompasses post-transcriptional events affecting the protein stability. Notably, Cby1 expression was remarkably reduced in the putative BCR-ABL1+ LSC compartment identified by a CD34+ phenotype compared with differentiated leukemic progenitors. In this cell context, Cby1 downmodulation was evoked by transcriptional events driven by DNA hypermethylation at the promoter-associated CpG islands of the Cby1- encoding gene C22<italic>orf</italic>2. DNA hypermethylation has been involved in BCR ABL1- driven silencing of multiple tumor suppressor genes, eventually associated with the disease progression toward a fully transformed phenotype of BC and/or drug resistance. Its role in Cby1 downmodulation leading to beta catenin activation may be critical in LSC survival and self-renewal.</p>

<p><bold>Clinical details of 40 CML-CP patients included in the study.</bold> The disease prognosis was based on the Sokal score at diagnosis and designated as low, intermediate or high risk of disease progression. Cytogenetic analysis performed at diagnosis underscored the type of translocation. Thirty two patients achieved a complete hematological response (CHR) at the 3<sup>rd</sup> month of therapy with TK inhibitors. The follow-up of remaining 8 was not sufficient to assess the response to therapy (not evaluable: NE). Thirty one patients achieved a MMR (3 log reduction of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels compared to diagnosis) within the 1<sup>st</sup> year of therapy. One patient (35) did not achieve a MMR within the same interval and the follow-up of remaining 8 patients was too short to evaluate the molecular response to therapy.</p>
