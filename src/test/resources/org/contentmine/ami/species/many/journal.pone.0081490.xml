<abstract>
<p>The phenotypic manifestations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are modulated by mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, nuclear modifier genes and environmental factors. The yeast mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G (P<sup>R</sup> or P<sup>R</sup><sub>454</sub>) mutation corresponds to the human 12S rRNA C1494T and A1555G mutations, which are well known as primary factors for aminoglycoside-induced nonsyndromic deafness. Here we report that the deletion of the nuclear modifier gene <italic>MTO2</italic> suppressed the aminoglycoside-sensitivity of mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. First, the strain with a single mtDNA C1477G mutation exhibited hypersensitivity to neomycin. Functional assays indicated that the steady-state transcription level of mitochondrial DNA, the mitochondrial respiratory rate, and the membrane potential decreased significantly after neomycin treatment. The impaired mitochondria could not produce sufficient energy to maintain cell viability. Second, when the <italic>mto2</italic> null and the mitochondrial C1477G mutations co-existed (<italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>)), the oxygen consumption rate in the double mutant decreased markedly compared to that of the control strains (<italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>), <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>) and <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>)). The expression levels of the key glycolytic genes <italic>HXK2</italic>, <italic>PFK1</italic> and <italic>PYK1</italic> in the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain were stimulated by neomycin and up-regulated by 89%, 112% and 55%, respectively. The enhanced glycolysis compensated for the respiratory energy deficits, and could be inhibited by the glycolytic enzyme inhibitor. Our findings in yeast will provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of human deafness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The phenotypic manifestations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are modulated by mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, nuclear modifier genes and environmental factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Ryan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Wallace1">[2]</xref>. A typical example is the human mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G mutation, which is well known as a primary determinant of aminoglycoside-induced nonsyndromic deafness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Prezant1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Yuan1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Estivill1">[5]</xref>. However, individuals carrying the A1555G mutation exhibit diverse clinical phenotypes ranging from normal hearing to severe deafness. This suggests that the clinical symptom may be also under the regulation of nuclear genes and environmental factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Prezant1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Estivill1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Guan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Guan2">[7]</xref>. So far, most studies on the mitochondrial A1555G mutation have had their main focus upon one factor, or the interaction between two factors. The combined effect of mtDNA mutation and nuclear modifier genes have been presented in several studies where environmental influences appear to play a role but remain poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Guan2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Yan1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>The yeast mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation corresponds to the human 12S rRNA C1494T and A1555G mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Yeast carrying this mutation is often used as a genetic model to investigate nuclear-mitochondrial interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Yan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Ghezzi1">[10]</xref>. However, in a contrasting case to that of A1555G mutation in humans, the exact impact of the C1477G mutation on yeast antibiotic sensitivity remains disputed. Kutzleb <italic>et al</italic> first reported a yeast strain resistant to paromomycin, and later Li <italic>et al</italic> identified a C1477G mutation in the 3â€² end of mitochondrial 15S rRNA gene from the same strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Li2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Kutzleb1">[12]</xref>. This mutation locates at a highly conserved rRNA decoding site (A-site), and alters the base pairing between C1477 and G1583 nucleotides. However, Weiss-Brummer <italic>et al</italic> did not observe the paromomycin resistant phenotype when culturing the C1477G mutant strains on paromomycin-containing medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-WeissBrummer1">[13]</xref>. The human A1555G mutation generates comparable modifications of secondary structure to those of the yeast C1477G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and makes individuals highly susceptible to aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides are widely used clinically, but their ototoxiticy limits the range of their application. The binding of aminoglycoside antibiotics to mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA carrying the A1555G or C1494T mutations leads to a mitochondrial respiratory defect and eventually to drug-induced deafness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Prezant1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Qian1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Zhao1">[15]</xref>. Thus, the penetrance and expressivity of the A1555G mutation in carriers are often enhanced by aminoglycosides.</p>

<p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation combining with the nuclear gene <italic>mss1, mto1</italic> or <italic>mto2</italic> null mutations generated a respiratory deficient phenotype. In yeast mitochondria, Mto2p, along with Mto1p and Mss1p, participates in the same pathway catalyzing the formation of the hypermodified base 5-mthyl-aminomethyl-2-thio-uridine (mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34) in the wobble position of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> and tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Decoster1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Umeda1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Colby1">[18]</xref>. <italic>MTO2</italic> encodes a mitochondrial tRNA-specific 2-thiouridylase, which is responsible for 2-thiolation of the U34 nucleotide in the tRNA anti-codon loop. This is the initial step of the mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34 modification pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Umeda1">[17]</xref>. This kind of modification is crucial to the mitochondrial translational fidelity and the efficiency of protein synthesis, because the modified uridine base increases both the stability of these tRNAs and the capacity of codon recognition at the ribosomal A-site. Meanwhile, <italic>TRMU</italic> (human <italic>MTO2</italic>) was the first identified nuclear modifier gene regulating the phenotypic manifestation of the mitochondrial A1555G mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Guan3">[19]</xref>. These studies indicated a complex interaction between the <italic>MTO2</italic> (<italic>TRMU</italic>) gene and the mitochondrial small rRNA.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study is to determine the interactions among mitochondrial rRNA mutations, nuclear genes, and environmental factors, as well as their combined effects on cellular function. For the first time, we found that the nuclear gene <italic>MTO2</italic> could modulate aminoglycoside antibiotic sensitivity induced by the mitochondrial C1477G mutation. Yeast carrying the 15S rRNA C1477G mutation alone exhibited hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, while <italic>MTO2</italic> deletion suppressed aminoglycoside-sensitivity in yeast carrying the mitochondrial C1477G mutation. The underlying molecular mechanism was also analyzed. Biochemical activities of cells and mitochondria, including those of respiratory rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression levels of mitochondrial and glycolytic genes, were determined.</p>

All yeast strains were cultured in YPD complete medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone and 2% glucose). Aminoglycoside antibiotic-containing media were prepared by adding 100 mg/ml stock solutions of antibiotics into the YPD medium after sterilization. The final working concentration of each antibiotic was determined according to the data from a minimal inhibitory concentration assay. 100 mM 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) stock solution was prepared in DMSO, and the final concentration of 2-DG in YPD was 2.5 mM.</p>

<title>Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay</title>
<p>The MIC<sub>90</sub> was defined as the minimal antibiotic concentration at which 90% of organism growth was inhibited by the drug after incubation for 24 hours at 30Â°C. Neomycin and paromomycin were purchased from Sigma. To determine the MIC<sub>90</sub> of each aminoglycoside antibiotic on each yeast strain, cultures were grown to a mid-log phase at 30Â°C in YPD medium. Then the cells were harvested and subcultured in a YPD medium containing 2 fold gradient dilutions of antibiotics, where the starting cell density was 2Ã—10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-FanMinogue1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Pfister1">[21]</xref>.</p>

<title>Phenotypic Analysis and Growth Curve</title>
<p>For the phenotypic analysis, yeast strains were inoculated and grown in a liquid YPD medium at 30Â°C overnight until they reached the exponential growth phase. The cultures were then harvested, serially diluted, and spot on the YPD medium and YPD containing aminoglycosides, respectively. The plates were incubated at 30Â°C for 3 days and photographs were taken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Yan1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>For the growth curve analysis, strains were cultured in liquid YPD both in the absence and presence of aminoglycoside with a starting cell density of 0.01 OD<sub>600</sub>.

<p>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements were carried out as described elsewhere with minor modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Raimundo1">[23]</xref>. Yeast cells were cultured in liquid YPD medium at 30Â°C overnight. Then cells were harvested and subcultured at the starting density of 2Ã—10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in both antibiotic-containing and antibiotic-free media for 16 hours. After validation of the phenotypes, cells were harvested in the mid log-phase and subsequently seeded in pre-coated Poly-D Lysine (50 Î¼g/ml) XF 96-well microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) at 4Ã—10<sup>5</sup> cells per well, then spun down, and inoculated at 30Â°C for 30 min. Subsequently the oxygen consumption rate was measured according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions on a Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. The OCR was shown as picomole oxygen per minute per cell (pmol/min/cell).</p>

<title>Growth Activities of Yeast Strains in the Presence of Neomycin</title>
<p>Our previous studies had revealed that the mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation combined with <italic>mto2</italic> null mutation impaired mitochondrial function in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Yan1">[8]</xref>. Here we have further determined the effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics and the interrelationships among nuclear modifier gene, mitochondrial rRNA mutation and antibiotics. To examine the functional consequence of antibiotics on yeast, yeast cells carrying mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G and/or nuclear <italic>mto2</italic> null mutation were cultured in YPD medium containing neomycin. Cellular growth activities were then measured. Yeast of wild type 15S rRNA and <italic>MTO2</italic> genotypes were used as positive controls.</p>
<p>The phenotypes of yeast with different genetic backgrounds indicated that a mutation in mitochondrial 15S rRNA leads to neomycin sensitivity. All four strains grew well on the YPD medium and no difference in growth was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, when grown on medium containing 300 Î¼g/ml neomycin, the growth of the strains carrying mitochondrial 15S rRNA mutations were inhibited compared to wild type P<sup>S</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These phenotypes were consistent with yeast growth curves in liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g002">Figure 2B, D</xref>). When cultured in media containing neomycin, the two mitochondrial mutant strains exhibited delayed logarithmic phases, while the P<sup>S</sup> strains entered rapidly into logarithmic growth at approximately 6 hours after inoculation.</p>

<p>Although the deletion of the nuclear gene <italic>MTO2</italic> had no effect on P<sup>S</sup> strains, it significantly altered neomycin susceptibility for strains carrying a mitochondrial 15S rRNA mutation. The <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain was totally inhibited by neomycin after 3 daysâ€™ incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the double mutant <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) displayed a much better growth activity and was only partially inhibited. Nevertheless, in the aspect of growth curves, the two 15S rRNA mutant strains presented quite different log-phases. The cell density of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) was 0.3 OD<sub>600</sub> after 20 hoursâ€™ incubation in the neomycin medium, while <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) reached a final cell density of 1.01 OD<sub>600</sub>. These data strongly indicates that the nuclear gene <italic>MTO2</italic> regulates aminoglycoside sensitivity in yeast carrying the mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation, and that deletion of <italic>MTO2</italic> suppresses this sensitivity.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Mitochondrial Respiratory Rates</title>
<p>To determine the functional impacts of neomycin on yeast mitochondria <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the respiratory rates of the strains by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. In the absence of neomycin, the wild-type strain <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>) had a basal respiratory rate of 0.43 fmol/min/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Mitochondrial function was slightly disturbed by the mitochondrial 15S rRNA mutation, and the basal respiratory rate of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) was 11.63% lower than that of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>). Deletion of the <italic>MTO2</italic> gene had a significant influence on mitochondrial respiration under both P<sup>S</sup> and P<sup>R</sup> mitochondrial genetic backgrounds, and 60.47% (<italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š0.0203) and 71.05% (<italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š0.01222) declines were observed in <italic>mto2</italic> null strains, respectively.</p>

<p>Cells were harvested in the mid log-phase. The oxygen consumption rate of each yeast strain was measured at the density of 4Ã—10<sup>5</sup> cells/well by FX-96 oxygraph (SeaHorse Biosciences) in the absence or presence of 32 Î¼g/ml neomycin. The results are shown as meansÂ±SD of triplicate.</p>

<p>We further analyzed the respiratory rates of yeast in the presence of neomycin. The respiratory rates of strains carrying the mitochondrial 15S rRNA mutation were significantly inhibited by neomycin as compared to the control group. After neomycin treatment, the respiratory rate of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) and the double mutant <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) declined by 65.79% and 58.33%, respectively. However, in the P<sup>S</sup> strains, only 23.26% and 29.41% declines were observed, respectively, suggesting that the wild type mitochondria were much less sensitive to neomycin. These data indicated that neomycin was more toxic to yeast cells carrying the mitochondrial 15S rRNA mutation.</p>

The fluorescent signal strength was altered by different genetic and antibiotic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the control group without neomycin, <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>), <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>) and <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) all had relatively high basal membrane potentials. However, the double mutant <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain had a much lower membrane potential, equivalent to 29% of that of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>). This indicates that the <italic>mto2</italic> null mutation and mitochondrial 15S rRNA point mutation have synergistic suppressive effects on mitochondrial function.</p>

<p>When cultured in media containing neomycin, the mitochondrial membrane potentials in yeast cells were inhibited to different extents. The membrane potentials of the two strains with a wild type mitochondrial genetic background declined by 11% and 19% after neomycin treatment, respectively. This suggests that neomycin has only a slight effect on wild type mitochondria. In contrast, the membrane potential of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) was significantly decreased by 86%, and the green fluorescent signal was almost invisible compared to the untreated control. Moreover, the mitochondrial membrane potential in the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain was further attenuated by neomycin, and in a manner somewhat parallel to the change of its respiratory rate.</p>

<p>The mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation affected steady levels of mitochondrial rRNAs. In the control group, <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) and <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) had significantly lower 15S rRNA transcripts than wild type P<sup>S</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggested that the C1477G mutation had impaired the stability of 15S rRNA. However, the expression patterns of <italic>21S rRNA</italic> between P<sup>R</sup> strains were quite different, suggesting that the large subunit and small subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes were differentially affected by the C1477G mutation. Unexpectedly, neomycin had no significant inhibitory effect on 15S rRNA and 21S rRNA in the P<sup>R</sup> strains.</p>

<title>Expression of Regulatory Genes in Glycolytic Pathway</title>

<p>The expression level of hexokinase was also analyzed by western blotting with an anti-hexokinase antibody. Hexokinase catalyzes the initial step of glycolysis, which irreversibly converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, a step which also plays an important regulatory role in glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Goncalves1">[28]</xref>. When cultured in media without neomycin, the hexokinase levels in <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>), <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) and <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strains were 83%, 84% and 64% compared to wild type <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081490-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). After neomycin treatment, only the double mutant <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) had an increased hexokinase level, which was 82% higher than its control. However, the other three strains had 12%, 5%, and 30% declines compared to the non-treated controls. These data indicated that the glycolytic pathway in the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain was up-regulated after neomycin treatment. In summary, we concluded that the <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain was significantly inhibited by neomycin because both aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms were suppressed. The up-regulated glycolysis in the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain may compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction induced by neomycin and thus this strain was less sensitive to neomycin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the interactions among the mitochondrial 15S rRNA C1477G mutation, the nuclear modifier gene <italic>MTO2</italic>, and neomycin, as well as their combined effects on mitochondrial function. The results suggest that yeast cells carrying the C1477G mutation in the mitochondrial 15S rRNA gene exhibit hypersensitivity to neomycin, while deletion of <italic>MTO2</italic> gene suppresses this sensitivity. Kutzleb first described paromomycin-resistance (P<sup>R</sup>) as a consequence of 15S rRNA C1477G mutation, because yeast with this mutation could survive on 2 mg/ml paromomycin-containing medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Kutzleb1">[12]</xref>. In contrast, Weiss-Brummer and colleagues reported that the C1477G mutation alone was not sufficient to form a paromomycin-resistant phenotpye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Kutzleb1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-WeissBrummer1">[13]</xref>. Our results supported Weiss-Brummerâ€™s study. When cultured in a YPD medium containing a low dosage of neomycin, yeast cells with the mitochondrial C1477G mutation were significantly inhibited compared to those of the wild type strain. Moreover, P<sup>R</sup> strains were also sensitive to other aminoglycosides, such as paromomycin and ribostamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081490.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The MIC<sub>90</sub> values of the neomycin of the wild type P<sup>S</sup> strains were both 128 Î¼g/ml, while the <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) and <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) had the MIC<sub>90</sub> values of 32 Î¼g/ml and 64 Î¼g/ml, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081490.s002">Table S1</xref>). A spot assay displayed a totally inhibited phenotype of <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) by neomycin, while the wild type <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>S</sup>) remained unaffected. Functional assays revealed that both the mitochondrial respiratory rate and membrane potential were aggravated after neomycin treatment. Meanwhile, the transcription levels of mitochondrial genes in C1477G mutant strains were sharply attenuated compared to those of the 15S rRNA wild type strains. Neomycin and other aminoglycosides are known to exert antibacterial effects by disrupting the elongation step in protein synthesis with ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Fourmy1">[30]</xref>. These antibiotics interfere with translation by inhibiting the translocation of the tRNA-mRNA complex from the ribosomal A site to the P site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Ogle1">[31]</xref>. Several mutations in eukaryotic mitochondrial rRNA genes, such as those of human A1555G and C1494T mutations, alter the binding activity of aminoglycosides to ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Prezant1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Zhao1">[15]</xref>. The binding of antibiotics to mutant rRNA may further interfere with the movement of the tRNA-mRNA complex on the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Feldman1">[32]</xref>. The yeast mitochondrial C1477G mutation is well known to form an identical secondary structure to that of human A1555G and C1477G mutations, and the structure of A1555G and C1494T mutant forms in humans is highly susceptible to neomycin binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Qian1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, the yeast mitochondrial ribosome with the C1477G mutation may exhibit a comparable affinity to neomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Yan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Li1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding is that the nuclear modifier gene <italic>MTO2</italic> regulates the antibiotic sensitivity of yeast carrying the C1477G mutation. The MIC<sub>90</sub> value of neomycin in <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) was elevated 2-fold compared to that in <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>), suggesting that the <italic>mto2</italic> null mutant was less sensitive to neomycin in the mitochondrial C1477G mutation. The growth curves clearly indicated that the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain had a more vigorous growth activity than <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) in the presence of neomycin. We also studied the neomycin intake and the expression levels of neomycin-resistant genes in these strains. No difference was observed (data unpublished). Expression assays of genes involved in the glycolytic pathway displayed distinct patterns between the two C1477G mutant strains when treated with neomycin. The transcription levels of <italic>HXK2</italic>, <italic>PFK1</italic> and <italic>PYK1</italic> in <italic>MTO2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strains were further suppressed after neomycin exposure, while in the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain these genes were up-regulated as compared to neomycin-free controls. This result indicates that, although deletion of the <italic>MTO2</italic> gene reduces oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of a C1477G mutation, it might also activate the glycolytic metabolic pathway and make the strain more dependent on glycolysis for its energy supply. Thus, the double mutant strain <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) exhibits a partially restored phenotype in a neomycin-containing medium. We also confirmed that the up-regulated glycolytic pathway in <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) cells could be suppressed by the hexokinase inhibitor 2-DG. This suppression again made the <italic>mto2</italic>(P<sup>R</sup>) strain sensitive to neomycin.</p>
<p><italic>MTO2</italic> is highly conserved evolutionally from <italic>E.coli</italic> to humans, and in all eukaryotes this gene encodes a mitochondrial-specific tRNA 2-thiouridylase, catalyzing the formation of cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34 in mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>, tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> and tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Umeda1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Sasarman1">[33]</xref>. According to our data, we suspect that the human homolog of <italic>MTO2</italic> may also regulate the aminoglycoside sensitivity of the A1555G mutation. Indeed, according to some epidemiological studies, the aminoglycoside sensitivity of A1555G mutation carriers varies between different ethnic populations where Asian people, for example, developed deafness more rapidly and severely after exposure to aminoglycosides. This could be associated with different nuclear genetic background, such as those of the various <italic>TRMU</italic> genotypes. Recently, a series of reports regarding <italic>TRMU</italic> mutation has been published, and it seems that these mutations are much more common in European and Latin American populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Guan3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-deMoraes1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Zeharia1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Schara1">[36]</xref>. In contrast, no mutation in the <italic>TRMU</italic> gene has thus far been identified in Asian populations, such as Chinese or Korean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Lu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Young1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081490-Bae1">[39]</xref>. Our study may therefore provide a novel insight into the pathogenesis of non-syndromic deafness induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics.</p>
