<abstract>
<p>The Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder whose incidence is estimated in about one in 400,000 to one in 20,000. No effective therapeutic strategies are known to halt progression or reverse muscle weakness and atrophy. It is known that the FSHD is caused by modifications located within a D4ZA repeat array in the chromosome 4q, while recent advances have linked these modifications to the <italic>DUX4</italic> gene. Unfortunately, the complete mechanisms responsible for the molecular pathogenesis and progressive muscle weakness still remain unknown. Although there are many studies addressing cancer databases from a machine learning perspective, there is no such precedent in the analysis of the FSHD. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing two specific FSHD databases. A feature selection algorithm is used as the main engine to select genes promoting the highest possible classification capacity. The combination of feature selection and classification aims at obtaining simple models (in terms of very low numbers of genes) capable of good generalization, that may be associated with the disease. We show that the reported method is highly efficient in finding genes to discern between healthy cases (not affected by the FSHD) and FSHD cases, allowing the discovery of very parsimonious models that yield negligible repeated cross-validation error. These models in turn give rise to very simple decision procedures in the form of a decision tree. Current biological evidence regarding these genes shows that they are linked to skeletal muscle processes concerning specific human conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder and the third most common inherited muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Tawil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Engel1">[2]</xref>. Its incidence may vary in different places and probably in different racial groups, but recent estimates account for one in about 400,000 to one in 20,000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-MDC1">[3]</xref>. FSHD patients show progressive weakening and atrophy of the muscles in the face, slowly progressing to the shoulder, upper arm muscles and shoulder girdle, down to the stomach and lower limbs. Inability to flex the foot upward, foot weakness, and an onset of right/left asymmetry are also common symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-vanderMaarel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Tawil2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the FSHD is considered a relatively benign dystrophy, about 20% of the patients presenting this disorder are eventually restrained to a wheel chair. The age of onset is variable, being the second decade of life the most common stage where patients become symptomatic. In some cases, however, symptoms never develop even when the individual has the mutation associated with the FSHD.</p>
<p>No effective therapeutic strategies are known to either halt progression or reverse muscle weakness and atrophy in the FSHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Rose1">[6]</xref>. However, there are a number of actions that can provide symptomatic and functional improvement in many patients. In particular, the use of assistive devices –such as braces, standing frames, or walkers– is of great help. Physical therapies like exercises in water, complemented by psychological support and speech therapy may also alleviate specially difficult life conditions.</p>
<p>It is known that the FSHD is caused by deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-vanderMaarel2">[7]</xref>. D4Z4 modification needs to occur on a specific chromosomic background to cause the FSHD. More than 95% of patients with clinical FSHD have an associated D4Z4 deletion on the 4q35 chromosome. However, a small number of kindreds with clinically typical FSHD do not present this dynamic. A second FSHD locus has not yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Tim1">[8]</xref>. Recent advances involve the <italic>DUX4</italic> gene, a retrogene sequence within D4Z4 that encodes a double homeodomain protein whose exact function is not entirely known. Although the proper mechanisms responsible for the progressive muscle weakness still remain unknown, the study of this gene could offer a possible therapeutic way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-vanderMaarel2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among different cell conditions. In the literature on machine learning, contributions concerning the analysis of gene expression FSHD data are very scarce, probably because of unawareness towards the highly rare diseases. The situation is aggravated by the absence of scientific data outside purely medical domains, in order to attack the problem from a different point of view. In contrast, there is now a vast body of available datasets about microarray gene expression analysis when focused to <italic>cancer</italic> diseases. Specifically, microarray gene expression databases have been used to discriminate between tumours or tumour subtypes, and to study biological properties of tumours –see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-VantVeer1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, Machine Learning (ML) has made significant inroads in the fields of bioinformatics and biomedicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Schlkopf1">[10]</xref>. Specifically, cancer research has applied a variety of ML algorithms for tumor prediction by associating expression patterns with clinical outcomes for patients with tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Lukas1">[11]</xref>. The majority of this research has focused on building accurate classification models from reduced sets of features. Some of these analyses also aim to gain understanding of the differences between normal and malignant cells and to identify genes that are differentially regulated during cancer development. The importance of the validity and reproducibility of statistical analysis and reporting cannot be stressed enough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Dupuy1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Typically, a gene expression data set may consist of dozens of samples but with thousands or even a few tens of thousands of genes (acting as <italic>features</italic>, using the ML terminology). Predictive model construction using this very high ratio between number of features and number of samples is a delicate undertaking, prone to obtain unreliable readings. As a result, dimensionality reduction and in particular <italic>feature selection</italic> techniques may be very useful, as a way to reduce the problem complexity and lighten medical expert diagnosis.</p>
<p>Of special importance in a practical medical setting is the <italic>interpretability</italic> of the obtained solutions, something that limits the applicability of methods such as PCA or ICA (whose solutions involve weighted combinations of genes, instead of individual genes). Moreover, in a medical context, data visualization in a <italic>low-dimensional</italic> representation space may become extremely important, as it would help doctors to gain insights into this complex and highly sensitive domain. The development of predictive models able to discern between healthy and FSHD samples with minimal error rate and amenable to direct interpretation is thus a clear research goal. When predictive models use very low numbers of relevant genes, these genes are likely to be associated with the disease, and can be used as a starting mechanism for further dedicated study from a biological point of view.</p>
<p>The present study addresses all these issues in two FSHD databases (named, just for reference in this paper, as FSHD-DB1 and FSHD-DB2) to discern between healthy and FSHD samples (clinical cases). We report experimental results supporting the practical advantage of combining robust feature selection and classification in the analyzed FSHD datasets. The described method is able to unveil two groups of genes that yield very low mean cross-validation error. These genes can be used to build very simple decision procedures in the form of a decision tree.</p>

<title>FSHD-DB1 Database</title>
<p>The feature selection process in <bold>Algorithm 1</bold> comes to a final solution in the form of a subset with only three genes and a 100% of mean 5×5 cv accuracy. This final subset is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082071-t001">Table 1</xref> including its gene IDs and full names. It will be hereafter referred as the FSHD-DB1 model. In comparison, PAMR delivers a 96.8% of mean 5×5 cv accuracy with 2 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082071-t002">Table 2</xref>), and SVM-RFE delivers a comparable 99.4% mean 5×5 cv accuracy, using 5 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082071-t003">Table 3</xref>). As a further comparison, if we consider the two genes signaled as most relevant in the literature (<italic>DUX4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-vanderMaarel2">[7]</xref> and <italic>FRG1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Pistoni1">[13]</xref>), the corresponding mean 5×5 cv accuracy of these two genes (taken together) is 84.65%.</p>

<title>Visualization</title>
<p>Data visualization in a low-dimensional representation space is extremely important to gain a better understanding of the solution delivered by the process. To visualize the result, the data corresponding to the FSHD-DB1 model are plotted using the three selected genes as axes, without any pre-processing method or projection technique –<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082071-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. In addition, the LDA decision boundary fitted in the whole data set is shown. The FSHD group presents a less compact distribution, while the Healthy group is clustered around a specific region of the representation space given by the three genes found. It can be seen that the two conditions are neatly separated.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is noticed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082071-g003">Fig. 3</xref> that the natural clusters do not necessarily correspond to labeled samples, and thus supervised information is needed to create accurate prediction models, even in this low-dimensional representation. Three clusters are discovered: a first one (H1 to H17), in which most (but certainly not all) of the samples belong to Healthy class; a second group (H18 to H22), containing three Healthy and two FSHD samples; finally, a third group (from F23 on) which is completely messed up. This result –although is certainly dependent on the limitations of clustering methods– alerts against using unsupervised feature extraction methods like PCA.</p>
<p>An interesting point to be emphasized in these graphic representations is that the FSHD-DB1 model clearly clusters the two conditions neatly –<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082071-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. We were therefore interested in ascertaining to what extent is this result stable and may thus constitute a good departing point for future studies. To this end, we performed two further investigations:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>The first action was to change the resampling method to 10 times 10-fold cross validation (10×10 cv). This form of resampling entails a much higher computational cost; however, it has been suggested as adequate for small sample situations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-BragaNeto1">[14]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The second action was to analyze the statistical differences between FSHD vs. Healthy samples in the expression levels for the genes in the model. In addition, we explored the possibility that a single gene is able to (almost) perfectly separate the two classes by mere chance.</p>
</list-item></list>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We were interested in exploring the effect of changing the resampling method, keeping the <italic>same</italic> classifier (LDA in this case), in order to exclude this source of variation from the analysis. Remarkably, using 10×10 cv instead of 5×5 cv in <bold>Algorithm 1</bold>, it was found that the final result fully coincided with the FSHD-DB1 model.</p>
<p>In order to assess statistical significance of expression levels, the Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU) was used in the comparison between FSHD vs. Healthy samples in the model. This is a non-parametric hypothesis test for assessing whether one of the two conditions (FSHD in this case) tends to have larger values than the other.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy, or FSHD, is a highly rare muscle disease for which there is no known cure nowadays. Two databases presenting samples of both healthy and FSHD patients have been analyzed with machine learning (ML) methods. There is hardly any precedent in the literature addressing this disease with these techniques.</p>
<p>The fact that the FSHD data analyzed in this study are scarce and of high dimensionality makes their computer-based automated classification a difficult undertaking. Most importantly, this high dimensionality precludes a straightforward interpretation of the obtained results, limiting their usability in a practical medical setting. In this vein, computational solutions like the one reported here should reckon the need of reporting not only highly accurate models: they should also represent low complexity and interpretable solutions amenable to further analysis by experts.</p>
<p>We have devised an approach to prediction of the FSHD condition from gene expression profiling, comprising an effective algorithm for gene selection enhanced with a mechanism for tie-breaking and based on a fairly standard classifier. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show that the method was highly efficient in identifying two subsets of genes that best characterize each class. In both cases, the discrimination process is shown very conveniently as a two-question decision tree. We have also provided evidence for the statistical significance and stability of the result. Our method delivers highly interpretable solutions that are more accurate than competing methods. The technique is general and could be used in other similar scenarios.</p>
<p>However, in small sample scenarios, there is a high risk of overfitting the data: small samples will appropriately support only simple models with few parameters (acting as the coefficients of the features). Moreover, the use of a classifier having one or more hyper-parameters (these are parameters that the classifier cannot determine in its training process, and must be determined externally) is unaffordable, since this would require an additional resampling loop, for which there would almost be no data left. As a consequence, the determination of these parameters would be subject to a very high degree of uncertainty. We have selected Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as the target classifier, using equal-covariance Gaussians to approximate class conditional probability densities. This choice corresponds to a linear, stable and parameter-free classifier. The LDA recognition rate was resampled using 5 times 5-fold cross validation.</p>
<p>One should bear in mind that the excellent reported results do not –by themselves– entail a medical solution to the disease, a situation that is faced by all statistical and ML solutions. On the contrary, a main goal of exploratory studies of this kind should be aimed towards understanding how the variables selected by the model fit in relation to prior knowledge from the medical domain.</p>

<title>The FSHD Databases</title>
<p>The first database used in this contribution was obtained from the EMBL-EBI repository of the European Bioinformatics Institute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-NCBI1">[23]</xref>. Specifically, the <italic>Experiment E-GEOD-3307</italic> uses the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome HG-133A and HG-U133B designs to analyse a range of muscle diseases for gene expression comparative profiling purposes. A total of 121 muscle samples of 11 muscle pathologies (plus several healthy samples) integrate the data: acute quadriplegic myopathy, juvenile dermatomyositis, amyotophic lateral sclerosis, spastic paraplegia, fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, calpain 3, dysferlin, and the FKRP using U133A and U133B array design. These are diseases with a extremely low incidence rate in the general population. The Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD), the targeted group in this work, consists of 14 FSHD samples and 18 healthy samples described by 22,283 genes or features (HG-133A version).</p>
<p>The second database was obtained from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) repository, a publicly available site in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The <italic>Experiment GSE36398</italic>, “Transcriptional profiling in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy to identify candidate biomarkers” is a very recent database containing FSHD information only. Using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array, the experiment analyses RNA extracted from both biceps and deltoids of FSHD subjects (26 samples) and unaffected first-degree relatives (24 samples), rendering a dataset that consists of 50 samples, described by 33,297 genes or features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Rahimov1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are no missing data in any of the two datasets; and both contain a mixture of positive and negative examples, necessary for learning. Moreover, in both cases the whole datasets were used.</p>

<title>Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>
<p>Linear and quadratic discriminant analyses or LDA/QDA (Duda et al. 2001) are widely used parametric methods which assume that the class distributions are multivariate Gaussians. With LDA, all classes are assumed to have the same covariance matrix. QDA does not need such an assumption; however, the number of parameters to be estimated from the data available for each class is much higher, entailing lower statistical significance.</p>
<p>In both methods, classification is achieved by assigning an example to the class for which the posterior probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e039" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> is greater, or equivalently for which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e040" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> is greater.</p>
<p>These methods are attractive because they need no parameter tuning, and their limited complexity (quadratic at most) may be a solid guard against overfitting the data. Moreover, for LDA fast updating procedures exist for the computation of certain forms of the cross-validation error <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Ripley1">[25]</xref>.

<p>Model selection is concerned with the process of finding the optimal model for a set of samples among a set of candidate models.

<p>The generic goal of cross-validation (CV) is to estimate the expected error of a model in a data set that is independent of the data that were used to train the model. One round of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e104" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>-fold CV (or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e105" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>-CV) involves partitioning the sample into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e106" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> complementary subsets, systematically performing the modeling on the union of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e107" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> such subsets and checking the obtained model on the remaining subset (acting as a validation set).

<title>The Feature Selection Algorithm</title>
<p>Feature selection can be seen as a search problem, where each state in the search space corresponds to a subset of the features. In the ML literature, a wide family of suboptimal algorithms depart from an initial solution and iteratively add or delete features by locally optimizing the error function. In <italic>forward selection</italic>, features are progressively incorporated into larger subsets; in <italic>backward selection</italic> (or elimination) one starts with the full set of features and progressively eliminates elements from it.</p>
<p>Wrappers are often criticized because they are computationally very expensive. Moreover, feature selection is badly affected by small sample sizes, producing overly optimistic results and introducing an excess of variance in the readings. This is aggravated in the presence of very sophisticated search algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Reunanen1">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, greedy search strategies seem to be particularly computationally advantageous and may alleviate the problem of overfitting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Guyon1">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, traditional pure forwardd selection and backward elimination search algorithms are ill-advised in that they cannot rectify their decisions and may end up delivering poor solutions both in terms of quality and size.</p>
<p>To reduce the number of genes and obtain small subsets of highly relevant genes, we use a simple but effective forward-backward feature selection algorithm. This algorithm follows the wrapper idea, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the feature selection algorithm uses a learner as a subroutine in the search for good subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-John1">[29]</xref>. In this general setting, when features are added or removed from the current subset the algorithm resorts to some performance measure –commonly the resampled rate of recognition.</p>
<p>An interleaved forward-backward search is developed looking for the improvement in performance of the chosen performance measure. The algorithm is described as the listing <bold>Algorithm 1</bold>. Given a performance measure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e110" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> to be maximized (in this case, the resampled evaluation of a classifier in a data sample), the algorithm searches the space of subsets by adding/removing features in a hill-climbing fashion.</p>
<p>Specifically, in every iteration of the outer loop, one feature is added to the current best solution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e111" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>, as long as this step improves on current performance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e112" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>. Then a variable number of feature removal steps is carried out, inasmuch the same condition of improved performance is met. This scheme is oriented to favour solutions with low numbers of features. The outer iteration also ends when no further improvement is observed. This strategy bears some resemblances with a floating search algorithm in its forward version <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Pudil1">[30]</xref>. However, it has a far lower computational cost given that discarded features are not considered again for another inclusion round. Note also that current subset performance is not compared specifically against the best performance achieved for the <italic>same</italic> size of the current subset (as floating methods do). It should be mentioned that the algorithm itself needs no parameter specification, although the chosen performance measure could have.</p>

<p>24: <bold>Output</bold>: <italic>BEST</italic>: <bold>Optimized feature subset</bold></p>
<p>As explained in the introduction, we are interested in a solution that combines high predictive performance, very small size (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a very low number of useful genes), admits visualization and interpretation, and hopefully may bear biological relevance.</p>
<p>To this end, we explicit now how the methods previously described glue together. The performance measure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e130" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> to be maximized in <bold>Algorithm 1</bold> is the accuracy rate of LDA. This recognition rate is resampled using 5 times 5-fold cross validation (5×5 cv for short), following common practices in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Hastie1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Due to the low number of samples, ties among the performance measure can happen easily. As a consequence, the gene subset selection process will end up in different final solutions, something that is not desirable in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Zhou1">[32]</xref>. How these ties are broken is non-trivial and should be addressed specifically and explicitly. However, the literature does not seem to offer any formal solution or procedure. Univariate methods as entropy-based measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Bell1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Furlanello1">[34]</xref>, the Fisher Score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Duda1">[35]</xref>, or some other statistical measures could be those preferred for their simplicity –see <italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Liu1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Liu2">[37]</xref>. Instead, a <italic>multivariate</italic> feature ranking method seems much more adequate to measure the relevance of a group of tied features.</p>
<p>As explained above, linear support vector machines (SVMs) can be seen as linear discriminant classifiers. Indeed, the numbers <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e131" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> in eq. (2) have been used as a surrogate for the relevance of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0082071.e132" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>-th gene since the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Guyon2">[38]</xref>. Notice that our approach is different in that predictive performance is the main criterion for optimization. Only in case of ties is the magnitude of the SVM weight vector being used. This is because the relation between this magnitude and final performance is rather indirect. This margin-based <italic>tie-breaking</italic> procedure has been incorporated into the feature selection algorithm. It is used every time an evaluation of the performance measure may incur on one or more ties –lines 2,7 and 16 in <bold>Algorithm 1</bold>.</p>

<title>Other Methods</title>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Prediction analysis for microarrays</title>
<p>PAMR (Prediction Analysis for Microarrays) performs sample classification from gene expression data, via the nearest shrunken centroid method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Tibshirani1">[39]</xref>. Similarly to the proposed method, PAMR estimates prediction error via cross-validation and provides a list of significant genes whose expression characterizes each diagnostic class.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4f2">
<title>Support vector machine for recursive feature elimination</title>
<p>SVM-RFE (Support Vector Machine - Recursive Feature Elimination) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Guyon2">[38]</xref> has been used widely with great success in microarray data analysis, particularly for disease gene finding. It largely eliminates redundant genes and usually yields very compact gene subsets. The genes are eliminated according to a ranking related to weight magnitude in the SVM solution. This is the same criterion for tie-breaking described in the previous section.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s4g">
<title>Software Implementation</title>
<p><bold>Algorithm 1</bold> was implemented entirely in MATLAB language, version 2012a. The computer codes were run on an Ubuntu Linux server version 11.10 with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5620 @ 2.40 GHz and 8 cores. The deployed solution to <bold>Algorithm 1</bold> takes advantage of the possibility to parallelize parts of the code, particularly lines 2, 7 and 16. In an 8-core scenario, eight genes or features can be evaluated at the same time. The complete software and instructions to reproduce the experiments described in this paper (or to conduct new ones) is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nova.mxl.uabc.mx/fernando/PO/for" xlink:type="simple">http://nova.mxl.uabc.mx/fernando/PO/for</ext-link> the interested reader.</p>
<p>The LDA classification algorithm and the resampling methods implied in <bold>Algorithm 1</bold> are developed using already existing MATLAB functions. The only part that uses an external toolbox is in the tie-breaking procedure –eq. (2). The well-known Steve Gunn’s MATLAB Support Vector Machine Toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Gunn1">[40]</xref> was used for this purpose. Full specification of parameters is described in the url link given above.</p>
<p>It is important to clarify that the data sets were used without any pre-processing step. The learning algorithms and the complete experimental setting were fed with the original downloaded E-GEOD-3307 and GSE36398 data. Complete details about the E-GEOD-3307 data set can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-3307/and" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-3307/and</ext-link> for GSE36398 data set, the location is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://0-www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.elis.tmu.edu.tw/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS4404" xlink:type="simple">http://0-www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.elis.tmu.edu.tw/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS4404</ext-link>. The two datasets differ in the number of columns given that they correspond to different technologies or gene chip versions. Although it is possible to map genes from one technology to another, this process requires a considerable effort that goes beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<p>The PAMR experiments were conducted through a specific R implementation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082071-Tibshirani1">[39]</xref> and run on the same Ubuntu Linux server described above. Specifically, the Nearest Shrunken Centroid classification algorithm works by shrinking each of the class centroids toward the overall centroid by a certain amount called the <italic>threshold</italic>. We used an adaptive computation of this value as provided in the PAMR package.</p>
<p>The SVM-RFE experiments were implemented with the Spider v1.7 software, a MATLAB Machine Learning package popular for feature selection tasks –see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://people.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/spider/main.html" xlink:type="simple">http://people.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/spider/main.html</ext-link>.</p>
