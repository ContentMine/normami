<abstract>
<p>An excessive intake of vitamin A has been associated with an increased risk of fractures in humans. In animals, a high vitamin A intake leads to a reduction of long bone diameter and spontaneous fractures. Studies in rodents indicate that the bone thinning is due to increased periosteal bone resorption and reduced radial growth. Whether the latter is a consequence of direct effects on bone or indirect effects on appetite and general growth is unknown. In this study we therefore used pair-feeding and dynamic histomorphometry to investigate the direct effect of a high intake of vitamin A on bone formation in rats. Although there were no differences in body weight or femur length compared to controls, there was an approximately halved bone formation and mineral apposition rate at the femur diaphysis of rats fed vitamin A. To try to clarify the mechanism(s) behind this reduction, we treated primary human osteoblasts and a murine preosteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) with the active metabolite of vitamin A; retinoic acid (RA), a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist (AGN194310), and a Cyp26 inhibitor (R115866) which blocks endogenous RA catabolism. We found that RA, via RARs, suppressed <italic>in vitro</italic> mineralization. This was independent of a negative effect on osteoblast proliferation. Alkaline phosphatase and bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (Bglap, Osteocalcin) were drastically reduced in RA treated cells and RA also reduced the protein levels of Runx2 and Osterix, key transcription factors for progression to a mature osteoblast. Normal osteoblast differentiation involved up regulation of Cyp26b1, the major enzyme responsible for RA degradation, suggesting that a drop in RA signaling is required for osteogenesis analogous to what has been found for chondrogenesis. In addition, RA decreased Phex, an osteoblast/osteocyte protein necessary for mineralization. Taken together, our data indicate that vitamin A is a negative regulator of osteoblast mineralization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Excessive vitamin A (retinol) intake is a risk factor for fracture in humans and the vitamin is the only known compound that can induce spontaneous fractures of long bones in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Melhus1">[1]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Binkley1">[4]</xref>. Studies in rodents have shown that these spontaneous fractures are caused by a reduced bone diameter, whereas there is little or no effect on bone mineral density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Johansson1">[5]</xref>. This bone thinning, in turn, appears to be caused by increased periosteal bone resorption and reduced diaphyseal radial growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Kneissel1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Conaway1">[7]</xref>. However, since a high vitamin A intake also results in anorexia and reduced weight gain, it is unclear whether the observed reduction of bone formation is a direct effect of vitamin A on bone or a consequence of indirect, systemic effects on appetite and general growth. To date, there are no studies that have controlled for these indirect effects, nor are there studies that have included dynamic histomorphometry at the diaphyseal site of the long bones.</p>
<p>Except in the eye, retinol is converted to retinal and then to retinoic acid (RA) in target cells, where RA binds to specific nuclear RA receptors (RARs). RAR expression has been shown in both primary human osteoblasts and in the murine preosteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Kindmark1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Inoue1">[9]</xref>. The intracellular RA concentration is determined by the balance between the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase driven RA synthesis and the RA-specific inactivation by the oxidizing P450 enzymes (CYP26 A, B and C). CYP26B1 expression has been shown to be increased by RA and reduced by a pan-RAR antagonist, indicating that this gene is a direct target of RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Reijntjes1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Gericke1">[12]</xref>. Human null and hypomorphic mutations in this major regulator of RA concentration in osteoblastic cells, CYP26B1, lead to severe skeletal anomalies, demonstrating the importance of strict regulation of intracellular RA levels also for human bone health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Laue1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Osteoblast differentiation is initiated by the expression of a key transcription factor named Runx2 in progenitor cells, leading to the generation of preosteoblasts. Runx2-deficient mice show a complete lack of ossified bones and, hence, Runx2 has been implicated as the master gene of osteoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Karsenty1">[14]</xref>. In preosteoblasts, Runx2 induces Sp7 (Osterix), which is an essential transcription factor for the initiation of extracellular matrix production and mineralization. The mature osteoblast is typically characterized by high bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (Bglap, Osteocalcin) expression. As the osteoblasts become surrounded by mineralized bone they reach their differentiation endpoint, switching to an osteocyte phenotype, which is characterized by dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1), sclerostin (Sost) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23) expression. Osteocytes, which make up more than 90% of all bone cells in the adult skeleton, were recently shown to be of major importance in regulating bone homeostasis by being the main source of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL, Tnfsf11) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Nakashima1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Jimi1">[16]</xref>. The membrane-bound, full-length RANKL protein is considered the pivotal form, inducing osteoclastogenesis by binding to RANK on osteoclast progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Jimi1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Xiong1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although there are numerous studies of RA effects in osteoblasts, information on the effects on bone formation <italic>in vitro</italic> is still very sparse and in a recent review it was concluded that “it is not possible to reach a firm conclusion regarding vitamin A action at this time.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Conaway1">[7]</xref>. The aim of this study was therefore to clarify the direct effect of vitamin A and its active metabolite RA on osteoblast mineralization, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Sweden. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Uppsala (Permit Number: C254/7). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 weeks of age, were obtained from Möllegaards Breeding Centre, Ltd. (Skensved, Denmark). They were fed a standard diet (Lactamin R36, Stockholm, Sweden) containing 12 IU vitamin A/g pellet (“Control”), or a standard diet supplemented with 1700 IU vitamin A/g pellet (“Vitamin A”) for 7 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Lind1">[19]</xref>. The control group is a pair-fed group, i.e. the control animals were fed the same amount of chow as consumed by the vitamin A group to keep food intake and body weight gain of the groups the same (n = 10/group). Vitamin A was added to the pellets in the form of retinyl palmitate and retinyl acetate. At the end of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed by exsanguinations from the abdominal aorta under Eqvitesin anesthesia (chloral hydrate 182 mg/kg, pentobarbital 41.7 g/kg) and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Serum analyses</title>
<p>Serum analyses of vitamin A were done by AS Vitas (Oslo, Norway) on samples (n = 10/group) shielded from light. Briefly, 200 µL of serum or standard solutions was mixed with 600 µL of 2-propanol and centrifuged at 4000 g. The supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography on an HP-1100 HPLC system furnished with a Supersphere 100 RP-18 column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and detected at 325 nm with an ultraviolet detector. Fgf23 (n = 10/group) was measured using the ELISA kit for rat FGF23 (Cusabio, Cat no. CSB-E12170r) and phosphate (n = 10/group) was quantified with the Quantichrome Phosphate Assay Kit (DIPI-500, Hayward, CA).</p>

<title>Histomorphometry</title>
<p>Histomorphometric parameters were measured from the diaphysis (cortical bone) of the femur of four randomly selected animals per group at Pharmatest, Finland, as recommended by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Parfitt1">[20]</xref>. The analysis of cortical bone was done using BioQuant Osteo II software version 8.12 (BioQuant Image Analysis Corporation, Nashville, TN). Bones were double-labeled with calcein at day 0 and at day 6 prior to the scheduled terminal necropsy at day 7 to measure dynamic parameters. The following parameters were determined at the periosteum: Total cross-sectional area of the bone (mm<sup>2</sup>), Mineralizing surface (%), Mineral apposition rate (µm/day) and Bone formation rate/bone surface (µm<sup>3</sup>/µm<sup>2</sup>/day).</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Primary human osteoblasts were isolated from bone obtained from male donors undergoing knee replacement surgery and had no reported bone-related pathologies other than osteoarthritis. The osteoblastic phenotype of cells was verified by use of biochemical markers as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Jonsson1">[22]</xref>. Uppsala University Hospital ethics committee approved this study (Permit Number: Dnr Ups 03-561) and waived the need for consent from these de-identified donors. The primary human osteoblasts and the mouse preosteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (from ATCC) were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin. To induce osteoblastogenesis, cells were switched to osteogenic media (control) containing 25 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate. Change of media was done every 2nd or 3rd day. At the end of the experiment total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent® (Sigma-Aldrich) or protein was extracted using 2 x SDS-PAGE sample buffer according to the BioRad protocol.</p>

<title>A high dietary vitamin A intake leads to a reduced mineral apposition rate</title>
<p>To control for indirect effects of vitamin A on appetite and general growth, we applied pair-feeding, i. e. the control rats were fed the same amount of food as that consumed by the vitamin A group. The vitamin A group acquired an approximately doubling of vitamin A levels in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Although there were no differences in final body weight or femur length, rats with hypervitaminosis A had thinner bones as they evinced a diminished total cross-sectional bone area (12%) at the mid diaphysis of the femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g001">Fig.1A</xref>). Dynamic histomorphometric analysis of these bones clearly showed that a high intake of vitamin A reduced the mineralizing surface (20%), bone formation rate (60%) and the mineral apposition rate (54%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These results indicate that a high vitamin A intake has direct and inhibiting effects on bone formation.</p>

<title>Retinoic acid reduces osteoblast mineralization <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To clarify the specific effect of vitamin A on osteoblasts, we first added RA to cultures of primary human osteoblasts. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, addition of 4 nM or 400 nM RA reduced calcium deposition by 14 and 54%, respectively, as quantified by Alizarin Red staining. Increasing endogenous RA concentrations using an inhibitor of the intracellular RA-degrading Cyp26 enzymes (R115866), reduced osteoblast mineralization by 12%. Addition of a pan-RA receptor (RAR)-antagonist (AGN) induced a small, non-significant increase (7%) in Alizarin Red staining. As preparations of primary cells from bone may contain other cells types, we then performed mineralization experiments using the mouse osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. In these cells, the effects of RA, the Cyp26 inhibitor and the RAR antagonist were even more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, addition of 400 nM RA or R115866 reduced Alizarin staining by 70 and 65%, respectively. AGN addition alone distinctly increased Alizarin staining to 170% of control. The significant increase in mineralization after adding the RAR antagonist indicates that the RA effect is RAR-dependent and that blocking endogenous RA is sufficient to increase mineralization. Concomitant addition of AGN completely reversed the effect of RA in the human cells and partly reversed the negative effect of RA on mineralization in the mouse cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g002">Fig. 2A,B</xref>).</p>

<title>The reduced mineralization is not only a consequence of inhibited cell proliferation</title>
<p>Next, we measured cell proliferation during MC3T3-E1 mineralization experiments using an MTT-based proliferation assay.

The number of non-viable cells did not differ from control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Next, to determine whether RA:s inhibitory effect on mineralization was dependent on its reduction of proliferation, we added RA or AGN at different time points. The results show that RA reduced mineralization even when added as late as day 14 (21%), after completion of the proliferation phase. Moreover, the RAR antagonist increased mineralization (16%) also when added after completion of the proliferation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082388-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By using pair-feeding to control for indirect effects on appetite and general growth, we could show that a high dietary vitamin A intake has a direct, negative effect on bone mineralization and diaphyseal radial growth in rats. In accordance with this <italic>in vivo</italic> observation, RA also inhibited mineralization <italic>in vitro</italic>. This appeared mainly to be a consequence of an inhibition of induction of the key transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix. In addition, Phex, which is necessary for normal mineralization, was suppressed in RA treated cells.</p>
<p>It has been shown that rats and mice, irrespectively of age and sex, respond rapidly to hypervitaminosis A with a reduced bone diameter, however the magnitude of the response is lower in skeletally mature animals and slower with lower doses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Johansson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Kneissel1">[6]</xref>. In the present study we have mimicked early hypervitaminosis A protocols using high doses of retinol in young male rats to induce distinct changes in a short time. The serum vitamin A level in these rats was similar to that seen in hypervitaminosis A toxicity in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Smith1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, normal osteoblast differentiation involved up-regulation of <italic>Cyp26b1,</italic> the major enzyme responsible for RA degradation, suggesting that a drop in RA signaling is required for osteoblast mineralization analogous to what has been found for chondrogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Pacifici1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Hoffman1">[27]</xref>. In line with this, we showed that addition of a Cyp26 inhibitor led to reduced mineralization. The negative effect of endogenous RA on osteoblast mineralization was further demonstrated by the finding that blocking RAR-signaling with a pan-RAR antagonist increased mineralization. This together with the recent observations that all three RAR receptors are downregulated during osteoblast differentiation support the view that RAR signaling is a negative regulator of osteoblast mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Roforth1">[28]</xref>. Previous studies on the effects of exogenous RA on mineralizing cultures of osteoblasts are consistent with our results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Kneissel1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Ohishi1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Iba1">[32]</xref> except one study which used a very high, supraphysiological concentration of RA (10 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Song1">[33]</xref>. When AGN was added together with RA, AGN completely reversed the effect of RA in the primary osteoblast cultures whereas it only partially blocked the negative effect of RA on mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. A reason for this difference might arise from that preparations of primary osteoblasts consist of a mix of osteoblasts and non-osteoblastic cells. In the MC3T3-E1 cells, AGN treatment consistently and significantly increased Alizarin staining although the magnitude varied. This may be due to a combination of extensive plasticity of mature osteoblasts together with the long culturing times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Liu1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Candeliere1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, both humans and mice lacking Cyp26b1 show reduced ossification of calvarial bones, which is consistent with our findings in rat periosteal bone and the MC3T3-E1 cell line from mouse calvaria. However, these mutants also have vertebral, joint, and cranial bone fusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Laue1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Maclean1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Spoorendonk1">[40]</xref>. This may seem contradictory, but in our opinion the defect behind these fusions is more likely to be morphogenic than a direct consequence of increased osteoblast mineralization. It may also involve non-osteoblastic cells since it is well-known that chondrocytes or pluripotent cells, such as embryonic stem cells, preadipocytes, adipose-derived adult stromal cells and adipose-derived mesenchymal cells, respond to RA by enhanced mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Iwamoto1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Wan1">[47]</xref>. Along these lines, and specifically regarding the observed craniosynostosis in Cyp26b1 mutants, it has been shown that cranial suture-derived mesenchymal cells enhance osteogenesis upon RA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-James1">[48]</xref>. The mechanism behind these opposite functions of RA in osteoblasts and non-osteoblastic cells is unclear, but may involve the bzip transcription factor CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein beta, which showed opposite effects of RA on Runx2 expression in mesenchymal stem cells and committed osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-WiperBergeron1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our study showed a distinct reduction of Runx2 protein upon RA treatment, whereas Runx2 transcript levels were unchanged, consistent with several studies that have indicated that the Runx2 transcript levels are less clearly regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Prince1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Li1">[53]</xref>. It is not yet known how RA alters Runx2 protein levels, but one possible mechanism could be via RA-induced proteasomal degradation, in analogy to how RA induces degradation of phosphorylated Smad1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Sheng1">[54]</xref>. Alternatively, the decreased Osterix protein levels may result in reduced Runx2 protein stability, as it was recently shown that Runx2 and Osterix protein co-expression synergistically increases their stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Rashid1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>That vitamin A is a negative regulator of bone mineralization is further strengthen by the recent observation that a retinol-free diet is more efficient than a high phosphate diet in rescuing the mineralization defects in the Phex mutant Hyp mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Seitz1">[56]</xref>. The underlying cause of the reduced mineralization in the Hyp mouse is the inactivation of the Phex gene. Phex has been shown to function in concert with Dmp1 and Fgf23 in regulating phosphate metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Martin1">[57]</xref>. Mice lacking both Phex and Dmp1 have non-additive effects, suggesting a common pathway for these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Martin2">[58]</xref>. Notably, a Dmp1 transgene does not rescue but instead further reduces bone mineralization in Hyp mice. This indicates that in the presence of low Phex levels, Dmp1 has a negative effect of bone mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Martin2">[58]</xref>. Since RA downregulated Phex and upregulated Dmp1 levels in our <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, this may, in part, have contributed to the reduced mineralization. Furthermore, RA prevented the induction of Fgf23 at the osteoblast level which was not reflected at the serum level, but is in line with the fact that retinol deprivation appears to impact the cell-autonomous mineralization defect of Hyp osteoblasts but not serum parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Seitz1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously published data suggest that RA can induce an osteocytic phenotype in short- and long-term cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Laue1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Mattinzoli1">[59]</xref>. Here, using 400 nM of RA during long-term culture (weeks), we observed that the expression of the osteocyte-associated genes RANKL and Dmp1 increased (which has also been observed earlier by us and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Laue1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Jacobson1">[60]</xref>). In contrast, other osteocyte-associated genes such as <italic>Phex</italic>, <italic>Sost</italic> and <italic>Fgf23</italic> were downregulated, which is opposite to recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Laue1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Mattinzoli1">[59]</xref>. The explanation for these discrepancies is probably that Laue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Laue1">[13]</xref> used a higher concentration of RA, fasting MCT3T-E1 cells and much shorter treatment time (48 h), and that Mattinzoli el al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Mattinzoli1">[59]</xref> used a very high (10 µM) concentration of RA. In this context it is worth pointing out that induction of osteocyte markers in cell culture takes quite a long time, e.g. it takes 14 days to produce detectable amounts of the osteocyte-specific Sost protein in the osteocyte cell line IDG-SW3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Woo1">[61]</xref>. We showed here that the RANKL and Dmp1 proteins first appeared clearly on day 21 in the RA treated preosteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. The concomitant expression of Dmp1 and full-length RANKL induced by RA <italic>in vitro</italic> is in agreement with our present and previous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082388-Lind1">[19]</xref> <italic>in vivo</italic> observations of increased periosteal Dmp1 staining and the number of cathepsin K-positive osteoclasts in hypervitaminosis A. Although we have not been able to stain for full-length RANKL in these bone sections, it is tempting to speculate that vitamin A concomitantly induces Dmp1 and RANKL also <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the full-length RANKL in these periosteal cells stimulates the formation of periosteal osteoclasts. Further studies will be needed to clarify this.</p>
