AB  - OBJECTIVE: We previously reported the five-year results of a randomised trial
      that compared induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IC+CCRT) 
      with induction chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (IC+RT) in patients with
      locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The aim of this study was
      to report the ten-year results and to explore potential prognostic factors.
      METHODS: From August 2002 to April 2005, 408 patients with locoregionally
      advanced NPC were randomly assigned to receive either IC (carboplatin and
      floxuridine)+CCRT (carboplatin) or IC+RT. The survival rates were analysed using 
      the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable
      analysis was performed to identify valuable prognostic factors. RESULTS: The
      ten-year overall survival, failure-free survival, locoregional failure-free
      survival and distant failure-free survival rates for the entire patient cohort
      were 49.5%, 48.0%, 80.8% and 66.9%, respectively. No significant survival
      differences were found between the IC+CCRT and IC+RT arms. By 3years from the
      date of randomisation, 62.5% of the relapses had been detected; no recurrence
      occurred after 8years. Within 3years after randomisation, 77.0% of the metastases
      were detected; 0.8% was identified after 8years. Age, Union for International
      Cancer Control (UICC) N-stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and body mass
      index (BMI) were independent prognostic factors that predicted death. Smoking
      status and total radiotherapy dose were independent prognostic factors that
      predicted locoregional recurrence. UICC N-stage, LDH and BMI were independent
      prognostic factors that predicted distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent
      carboplatin chemotherapy did not significantly improve the long-term survival
      after inductive carboplatin and floxuridine chemotherapy in locoregionally
      advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In addition to patient and tumour
      characteristics, LDH, BMI and smoking status were important baseline prognostic
      factors for tumour recurrence or distant metastasis; these are worthy of further 
      prognostic investigation in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is prevalent in patients with cognitive impairment, but the
      risks and benefits in this complex group are unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this
      study was to assess outcomes in a small cohort of patients with lifelong
      cognitive impairment who underwent bariatric surgery and to introduce important
      concepts when considering surgery in this complex group. SETTING: Academic
      institution, United States. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients
      with an objective psychological and/or neuropsychological diagnosis of lifelong, 
      nonacquired cognitive impairment who had bariatric surgery at our center.
      RESULTS: We identified 6 patients with a diagnosis of nonacquired cognitive
      impairment who underwent a bariatric procedure. The cohort (3 male, 3 female) had
      a mean age of 33.3 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 49.4 kg/m2. Two of
      the patients had a diagnosis of trisomy 21, and the other 4 patients had lifelong
      cognitive impairment from unknown causes. The distribution of surgical approaches
      was 2 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses (LRYGBs), 3 laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomies (SGs), and 1 laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB). There
      were no complications and no mortality. At a mean follow-up of 33.7 months, the
      cohort had a mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) of 31.1% (range -1.8%-72.2%).
      Two patients achieved a %EWL>50%. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that
      bariatric surgery can be performed with minimal morbidity in patients with
      nonacquired cognitive impairment after intensive multidisciplinary management.
      However, it appears this population may lose less weight than what is reported
      for patients without cognitive delay.

TI  - Obesity as a Risk Factor For Consideration For Left Ventricular Assist Devices.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes and is
      prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure requiring left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs).The understanding of high body mass index (BMI) and
      outcomes after LVAD implantation continues to evolve. In this study we
      investigated the effects of obesity on post-LVAD outcomes. METHOD: In this
      retrospective study, 288 patients with both HeartMate II and HeartWare HVAD,
      implanted as bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy (DT), were
      enrolled. Patients were stratified based BMI >/= 30. Baseline demographics were
      obtained. Post-LVAD incidence of readmissions and major adverse effects were
      tabulated. RESULTS: The cohort is comprised of 95 (33%) obese and 193 (67%)
      non-obese patients, 63 (25%) female and 225 (75%) male. 48 (20%) were implanted
      as BTT while 240 (80%) were implanted as DT. The mean BMI in the obese group was 
      35.2 kg/m2 compared to 24.3 kg/m2 (p<0.001) in the control group. Incidence of
      post-LVAD heart failure (29% vs 16%, p=0.009). Multivariate analysis confirmed
      that BMI was an independent predictor for only post-LVAD heart failure (OR: 2.47 
      95% CI: 1.15 - 5.32, p=0.02) Obese patients had a higher mean total number of
      hospitalizations compared to non-obese patients (4.2 vs. 3.4, p=0.03) as well as 
      higher median total length of stay post-LVAD (28 vs. 14 days p=0.05), however
      these were not significant when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSION: Obese
      patients had higher incidence of post-LVAD heart failure readmissions. There was 
      no difference in overall survival or outcomes between the two groups. There was
      no difference in total re-hospitalizations or length of stay between obese and
      non-obese patients. Our analysis suggests that obesity should not preclude LVAD
      candidacy.
