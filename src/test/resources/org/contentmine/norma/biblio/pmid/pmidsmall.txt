AB  - OBJECTIVE: We previously reported the five-year results of a randomised trial
      that compared induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IC+CCRT) 
      with induction chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (IC+RT) in patients with
      locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The aim of this study was
      to report the ten-year results and to explore potential prognostic factors.
      METHODS: From August 2002 to April 2005, 408 patients with locoregionally
      advanced NPC were randomly assigned to receive either IC (carboplatin and
      floxuridine)+CCRT (carboplatin) or IC+RT. The survival rates were analysed using 
      the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable
      analysis was performed to identify valuable prognostic factors. RESULTS: The
      ten-year overall survival, failure-free survival, locoregional failure-free
      survival and distant failure-free survival rates for the entire patient cohort
      were 49.5%, 48.0%, 80.8% and 66.9%, respectively. No significant survival
      differences were found between the IC+CCRT and IC+RT arms. By 3years from the
      date of randomisation, 62.5% of the relapses had been detected; no recurrence
      occurred after 8years. Within 3years after randomisation, 77.0% of the metastases
      were detected; 0.8% was identified after 8years. Age, Union for International
      Cancer Control (UICC) N-stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and body mass
      index (BMI) were independent prognostic factors that predicted death. Smoking
      status and total radiotherapy dose were independent prognostic factors that
      predicted locoregional recurrence. UICC N-stage, LDH and BMI were independent
      prognostic factors that predicted distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent
      carboplatin chemotherapy did not significantly improve the long-term survival
      after inductive carboplatin and floxuridine chemotherapy in locoregionally
      advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In addition to patient and tumour
      characteristics, LDH, BMI and smoking status were important baseline prognostic
      factors for tumour recurrence or distant metastasis; these are worthy of further 
      prognostic investigation in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is prevalent in patients with cognitive impairment, but the
      risks and benefits in this complex group are unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this
      study was to assess outcomes in a small cohort of patients with lifelong
      cognitive impairment who underwent bariatric surgery and to introduce important
      concepts when considering surgery in this complex group. SETTING: Academic
      institution, United States. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients
      with an objective psychological and/or neuropsychological diagnosis of lifelong, 
      nonacquired cognitive impairment who had bariatric surgery at our center.
      RESULTS: We identified 6 patients with a diagnosis of nonacquired cognitive
      impairment who underwent a bariatric procedure. The cohort (3 male, 3 female) had
      a mean age of 33.3 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 49.4 kg/m2. Two of
      the patients had a diagnosis of trisomy 21, and the other 4 patients had lifelong
      cognitive impairment from unknown causes. The distribution of surgical approaches
      was 2 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses (LRYGBs), 3 laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomies (SGs), and 1 laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB). There
      were no complications and no mortality. At a mean follow-up of 33.7 months, the
      cohort had a mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) of 31.1% (range -1.8%-72.2%).
      Two patients achieved a %EWL>50%. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that
      bariatric surgery can be performed with minimal morbidity in patients with
      nonacquired cognitive impairment after intensive multidisciplinary management.
      However, it appears this population may lose less weight than what is reported
      for patients without cognitive delay.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes and is
      prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure requiring left ventricular
      assist devices (LVADs).The understanding of high body mass index (BMI) and
      outcomes after LVAD implantation continues to evolve. In this study we
      investigated the effects of obesity on post-LVAD outcomes. METHOD: In this
      retrospective study, 288 patients with both HeartMate II and HeartWare HVAD,
      implanted as bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy (DT), were
      enrolled. Patients were stratified based BMI >/= 30. Baseline demographics were
      obtained. Post-LVAD incidence of readmissions and major adverse effects were
      tabulated. RESULTS: The cohort is comprised of 95 (33%) obese and 193 (67%)
      non-obese patients, 63 (25%) female and 225 (75%) male. 48 (20%) were implanted
      as BTT while 240 (80%) were implanted as DT. The mean BMI in the obese group was 
      35.2 kg/m2 compared to 24.3 kg/m2 (p<0.001) in the control group. Incidence of
      post-LVAD heart failure (29% vs 16%, p=0.009). Multivariate analysis confirmed
      that BMI was an independent predictor for only post-LVAD heart failure (OR: 2.47 
      95% CI: 1.15 - 5.32, p=0.02) Obese patients had a higher mean total number of
      hospitalizations compared to non-obese patients (4.2 vs. 3.4, p=0.03) as well as 
      higher median total length of stay post-LVAD (28 vs. 14 days p=0.05), however
      these were not significant when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSION: Obese
      patients had higher incidence of post-LVAD heart failure readmissions. There was 
      no difference in overall survival or outcomes between the two groups. There was
      no difference in total re-hospitalizations or length of stay between obese and
      non-obese patients. Our analysis suggests that obesity should not preclude LVAD
      candidacy.

TI  - The Association Between the Probability of Sarcopenia and Functional Outcomes in 
      Older Patients Undergoing In-Hospital Rehabilitation.
LID - S1525-8610(15)00348-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2015.05.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome with a prevalence ranging from 5%
      to 50% in community-dwelling adults. It is associated with adverse outcomes
      including worse functional status, falls, and mortality. A paucity of studies
      have included an assessment of sarcopenia among older adults receiving
      in-hospital rehabilitation. This is, at least partially, due to the lack of
      simple assessment methods to reliably measure muscle mass. The objective of this 
      study was to evaluate the probability of sarcopenia using a validated simple
      method and examine the association between sarcopenia and functional outcomes at 
      discharge. SETTING: One in-hospital rehabilitation setting. DESIGN: Prospective
      cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 patients 65 years and older who were
      admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation. MEASUREMENTS: The probability of
      sarcopenia was determined using a validated method that includes 3 variables:
      age, grip strength, and calf circumference. Two multivariable linear regression
      models were used to analyze the association between the probability of sarcopenia
      and the following functional outcome measures: (1) total Barthel index (BI)
      score; and (2) BI walking mobility subitem. Each analysis adjusted for the
      following covariates: age, gender, admission diagnoses, body mass index,
      comorbidity, C-reactive protein, number of medications on admission, Mini- Mental
      State Examination total score, and change in the functional outcome measure from 
      admission to discharge. RESULTS: Patients were mainly female (66%) with a mean
      age of 82 +/- 7 years. The mean probability of sarcopenia overall was 60%. About 
      one-half of the patients had a probability of sarcopenia >/=75% (N = 140). The
      remaining patients were distributed as follows: probability of sarcopenia <25% (N
      = 79); 25%-49% (N = 26); and 50%-74% (N = 34). The probability of sarcopenia was 
      significantly associated with an overall worse functional status at discharge
      based on total BI score (point estimate -8.5; standard error 17.1; P < .0001) and
      ability to walk at discharge as measured with the BI walking mobility subitem
      (point estimate -1.3; standard error 0.5; P = .02) after adjusting for relevant
      covariates. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of a simple screening
      tool for probable sarcopenia among older adults receiving in-hospital
      rehabilitation to increase the ability of clinicians to initiate early
      interventions to improve functional outcomes at discharge.

PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.1891/1540-4153.13.2.77 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Latinos, but few
      studies of disease risk in this subpopulation examine both area-level
      socioeconomic position (SEP) and its association with individual-level risk
      factors. This study sought to examine the cross-sectional relationship between
      neighborhood socioeconomic position (NSEP) and prevalent diabetes and prediabetes
      status among older Latinos. Longitudinal health data were collected from 1,789
      participants in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). Among SALSA
      participants, higher NSEP was associated with lower diabetes prevalence (p =
      .001). Adjustment for body mass index and other individual-level factors did not 
      affect this relationship. No association was observed between NSEP and
      prediabetes in both unadjusted and adjusted models. Neighborhoods with higher SEP
      had a lower prevalence of diabetes. This study highlights the importance of
      considering neighborhood factors that may place older Latinos at high risk for
      this disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a well-tolerated
      procedure but has high long-term complication and failure rates. Laparoscopic
      conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is one of the rescue strategies.
      OBJECTIVES: To analyze short- and long-term results of reoperative LRYGB after
      failed LAGB. SETTING: Three European expert bariatric center (2 university
      hospitals and 1 regional hospital). METHODS: A retrospective review of
      prospectively collected data, including all consecutive patients submitted to
      revisional LRYGB for failed LAGB between 1999 and 2013, was performed.
      Complications were classified according to the Dindo-Clavien system. Long-term
      results in terms of weight loss were analyzed in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS:
      A total of 642 patients (569 women and 73 men) were included. Mean+/-standard
      deviation operating time was 188+/-43 minutes. There was no mortality and an
      overall complication rate of 9.7%, including 3.6% major complications, with no
      difference between the 1- or 2-step approaches. Follow-up rate was 88% at 10
      years for the Swiss patient cohort. The mean excess body mass index loss was
      between 65% and 70% throughout the study period, and the mean total weight loss
      was between 28% and 30% based on the maximum weight. The mean body mass index
      decreased from 44.7 kg/m2 before LAGB to 31.6, 32.2, and 32.5 kg/m2 at 1, 5, and 
      10 years after revision. CONCLUSIONS: Revisional LRYGB is well tolerated and
      feasible after failed LAGB. A 1-step approach, in cases without erosion, does not
      increase operative morbidity. Results up to 10 years after revision are
      comparable to those reported after primary LRYGB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous reports address bariatric outcomes in super-obese or elderly
      patients, but data addressing this high-risk combination is lacking. OBJECTIVE:
      The objective of this study was to assess outcomes of bariatric surgery in the
      super-obese elderly. SETTING: Academic institution, United States. METHODS: All
      primary bariatric cases performed on patients aged 65 years or older with a body 
      mass index (BMI)>/=50 kg/m2 were retrospectively analyzed. Surgical approaches
      included laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). RESULTS:
      Thirty patients (26 female, 4 male) with a mean age of 67.1+/-2.7 years and BMI
      of 55.9+/-3.9 kg/m2, who had LRYGB (n = 16), LSG (n = 6), or LAGB (n = 8), were
      identified. There were no deaths, conversions, or intraoperative complications.
      Three patients were lost to follow-up after the 3-month visit. The early (<30 d) 
      major morbidity rate was 10.0%. At a median follow-up of 37 (range, 6-95) months,
      the cohort had a mean BMI of 42.3+/-6.7 kg/m2, which corresponded to a mean
      percent excess weight loss of 44.5%+/-20.5% and mean percent total weight loss of
      24.4%+/-12.2%. The most percent excess weight loss was achieved after LRYGB
      (54.1%+/-19.4%), followed by LSG (48.3%+/-10.2%) and then LAGB (26.2%+/-14.4%).
      Diabetic medication reduction in number and/or dosage was observed in 40% (6/15) 
      patients, and 33% (5/15) of patients were completely off antidiabetic agents.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although further research is needed, the present data suggest that
      successful weight loss and metabolic improvement can be achieved safely in the
      high-risk population of super-obese elderly.

TI  - Do loss to follow-up and death rates from ART care vary across primary health
      care facilities and hospitals in south Ethiopia? A retrospective follow-up study.
PG  - 167-74
LID - 10.2147/HIV.S85440 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decentralization and task shifting has significantly improved access 
      to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Many studies conducted to determine the
      attrition rate in Ethiopia have not compared attrition rates between hospitals
      and health centers in a relatively recent cohort of patients. This study compared
      death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) rates among ART patients in hospitals and
      health centers in south Ethiopia. METHODS: Data routinely collected from patients
      aged older than 15 years who started ART between July 2011 and August 2012 in 20 
      selected health facilities (12 being hospitals) were analyzed. The outcomes of
      interest were LTFU and death. The data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed using 
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 and Stata version 12.0. 
      Competing-risk regression models were used. RESULTS: The service years of the
      facilities were similar (median 8 and 7.5 for hospitals and health centers,
      respectively). The mean patient age was 33.7+/-9.6 years. The median baseline CD4
      count was 179 (interquartile range 93-263) cells/mm(3). A total of 2,356
      person-years of observation were made with a median follow-up duration of 28
      (interquartile range 22-31) months; 24.6% were either dead or LTFU, resulting in 
      a retention rate of 75.4%. The death rates were 3.0 and 1.5 and the LTFU rate
      were 9.0 and 10.9 per 100 person-years of observation in health centers and
      hospitals, respectively. The competing-risk regression model showed that the gap 
      between testing and initiation of ART, body mass index, World Health Organization
      clinical stage, isoniazid prophylaxis, age, facility type, and educational status
      were independently associated with LTFU. Moreover, baseline tuberculous disease, 
      poor functional status, and follow-up at a health center were associated with an 
      elevated probability of death. CONCLUSION: We observed a higher death rate and a 
      lower LTFU rate in health centers than in hospitals. Most of the associated
      variables were also previously documented. Higher LTFU was noticed for patients
      with a smaller gap between testing and initiation of treatment.

TI  - Contribution of the Neighborhood Environment and Obesity to Breast Cancer
      Survival: The California Breast Cancer Survivorship Consortium.
LID - cebp.0055.2015 [pii]
AB  - Little is known about neighborhood attributes that may influence opportunities
      for healthy eating and physical activity in relation to breast cancer mortality. 
      We used data from the California Breast Cancer Survivorship Consortium and the
      California Neighborhoods Data System to examine the neighborhood environment,
      body mass index, and mortality after breast cancer. We studied 8,995 African
      American, Asian American, Latina, and non-Latina White women with breast cancer. 
      Residential addresses were linked to the CNDS to characterize neighborhoods. We
      used multinomial logistic regression to evaluate the associations between
      neighborhood factors and obesity, and Cox proportional hazards regression to
      examine associations between neighborhood factors and mortality. For Latinas,
      obesity was associated with more neighborhood crowding (Quartile 4 (Q4) vs. Q1:
      Odds Ratio (OR)=3.24; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.50-7.00); breast
      cancer-specific mortality was inversely associated with neighborhood businesses
      (Q4 vs. Q1: Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.46; 95% CI: 0.25-0.85) and positively associated 
      with multi-family housing (Q3 vs. Q1: HR=1.98; 95% CI: 1.20-3.26). For non-Latina
      Whites, lower neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with obesity
      (Quintile 1 (Q1) vs. Q5: OR=2.52; 95% CI: 1.31-4.84), breast cancer-specific (Q1 
      vs. Q5: HR=2.75; 95% CI: 1.47-5.12), and all-cause (Q1 vs. Q5: HR=1.75; 95% CI:
      1.17-2.62) mortality. For Asian Americans, no associations were seen. For African
      Americans, lower neighborhood SES was associated with lower mortality in a
      nonlinear fashion. Attributes of the neighborhood environment were associated
      with obesity and mortality following breast cancer diagnosis, but these
      associations differed across racial/ethnic groups.

      and Neck Cancer Patients].
PG  - 200-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients decreases
      survival, quality of life (QOL) and oncological outcomes. The aim of the
      prospective three-year study was to compare QOL, clinical symptoms and variables 
      (complications, survival and mortality rates in HNC patients). PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A total of 726 patients aged 55 to 72 years with treatable HNC were
      included from January 2004 to December 2009; these patients were randomized to
      either group with PEG and enteral nutrition and nonPEG group with nutritional
      counselling according to nutritional care. We used EORTC questionnaires QOL C-30 
      and Head and neck module (HN-35) for measuring of QOL. The following variables
      due to expectable influence on QOL (demographic data, oncological data,
      nutritional screening, Clinical symptom score, Karnofsky performance status
      score, Charlson comorbidity index) were included. Monitoring was done five times 
      in three years. RESULTS: In the first six months, we found decrease of weight and
      body mass index (BMI). After this critical time point and finish of oncological
      treatment, a marked difference in the development of patients treated with PEG.
      Negative factors influencing patients survival, QOL, clinical status were males
      aged > 63 years, hypopharyngeal cancer (stage III- IV), smoking, weight loss >
      10%, BMI < 21 and disallowance of PEG. CONCLUSIONS: QOL is an essential factor
      for cancer patients. Our study showed that nutritional intervention with early
      enteral nutrition may improve QOL and survival in HNC patients. The PEG group
      better tolerated oncological treatment, had lower incidence of complications,
      shorter time to re-entry of permanent increase in weight, lower rate of
      rehospitalization and its shorter length. We found QOL questionnaires to be very 
      important for better understanding and communication and a key instrument for
      improving solution of patients difficulties during their therapy in
      multidisciplinary approach.Key words: head and neck cancer - quality of life -
      EORTC - C-30 - HN-35 - PEG - malnutrition The authors declare they have no
      potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, orservices used in
      the study. The Editorial Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE

TI  - Survival Benefit of Statins in Hemodialysis Patients Awaiting Renal
      Transplantation.
PG  - 105-12
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1547373 [doi]
AB  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have extraordinarily high cardiovascular 
      risk and mortality, yet the benefit of statins in this population remains unclear
      based on the randomized trials. We investigated the prognostic value of statins
      in a large, pure cohort of prospectively recruited patients with ESRD awaiting
      renal transplantation, and being followed up in a dedicated cardiac clinic. We
      prospectively collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacological
      data on 423 consecutive ESRD patients on hemodialysis awaiting renal
      transplantation. Survival analysis was performed as a function of statin therapy.
      The baseline characteristics were as follows: age 57 +/- 11 years, males 64%,
      diabetes mellitus in 68%, known coronary artery disease in 30%, left ventricular 
      (LV) ejection fraction 61 +/- 11%. Over a mean follow-up of 2 years, there were
      43 deaths. Adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, body mass index, diabetes
      mellitus, coronary artery disease, smoking, and treatment with angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor, beta blocker, and antiplatelet medications, statin
      use was a predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence
      interval 0.11-0.79, p = 0.01). This beneficial effect of statin was supported by 
      propensity score analysis (p = 0.02) and was consistent across all clinical
      subgroups. The benefit of statins seemed to be greater in those with LV
      hypertrophy and smoking. Statin therapy in hemodialysis patients awaiting renal

TI  - Primordial Influence of Post-operative Compliance on Weight Loss After Adolescent
      Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that the benefits seen in adult
      bariatric surgery can be reproduced in adolescents. In contrast with North
      America, bariatric surgery in adolescents is still not well accepted in Europe
      and indications and protocols have still to be formulated. METHODS: This
      prospective study tested the gastric banding procedure in 49 patients operated in
      a single French institution since 2008. The mean age at surgery was 16.2 +/- 0.9 
      years with a weight of 118.8 +/- 22.3 kg and body mass index of 42.5 +/- 5.9
      kg/m2. RESULTS: At 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery, weight was 103.7 +/- 20.8
      kg, 98.7 +/- 21 kg and 93.6 +/- 19.3 kg, respectively (p < 0.001), corresponding 
      to excess weight loss (EWL) of 31.6 +/- 17.2 %, 41.8 +/- 21.4 % and 59.1 +/- 24.9
      % (p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of
      consultations per year was the only variable significantly associated to weight
      loss. Metabolic disorders were corrected, with a decreased prevalence of insulin 
      resistance from 100 to 17 % and normalisation of homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 24 months (2.09 +/- 0.95).
      Band-related complications were five slippages, one psychological intolerance and
      two ports repositioning. Six patients (12 %) had the device explanted. The death 
      of a patient was an exceptionally severe adverse event. CONCLUSION: Given
      frequent follow-up support by a multidisciplinary team, laparoscopic adjustable
      gastric banding (LAGB) surgery in adolescent results in sustained weight loss.
      However, even exceptional, potentially serious complications are possible and
      long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio at 5 or 10 years
      after LAGB surgery.

TI  - Risk factors for surgical site infection in laryngeal cancer surgery.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - Surgical site infection (SSI) is a significant factor of morbidity and mortality 
      in patients surgically treated for laryngeal carcinoma. The aim of this
      prospective study in 277 patients was to determine the incidence of SSI in
      patients surgically treated for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and to identify
      risk factors for development of SSI. Patients with previous chemotherapy and/or
      radiotherapy were excluded. All patients had tracheostomy postoperatively and
      received antibiotic prophylaxis with cephalosporin, aminoglycoside and
      metronidazole. The overall incidence of SSIs in our cohort was 6.5% (18
      patients): 4 (22.22%) patients with superficial infections, 11 (61.11%) with deep
      infections and 3 (16.66%) with organ-space infections. The remaining infections
      included pneumonia (1 case) and Clostridium difficile colitis (2 cases). The
      median hospital stay in patients having developed SSIs was longer than in those
      without SSIs (33.5 vs. 16 days, p < 0.001). By using univariate analysis American
      Society of Anesthesiologists score > 3, duration of surgery longer than 120
      minutes and National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index > 1 were found
      to be significantly associated with the occurrence of SSI. Age, sex, body mass
      index, history of smoking, underlying diabetes and preoperative length of stay
      were found not to be associated with SSI. The most frequently isolated
      microorganism was Klebsiella spp.
