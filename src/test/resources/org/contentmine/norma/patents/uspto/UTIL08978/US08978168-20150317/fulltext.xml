<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a pair of swim goggles, and particularly to a pair of swim goggles for the use in a swimming pool, wherein a left lens frame and a right lens frame of the swim goggles are detachably and separately assembled with a connecting frame and adjustable in transverse with respect to the connecting frame.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional swim goggles for the use in a swimming pool are generally of a left and a right lens frames, which are varied in structure by functions or purposes of such as comfort of wearing, adjustment of head strap, or leak-proof and so on, wherein the left and right lens frames are generally connected by a connecting element, which is able to be used for adjusting a span between the left and right lens frames, however, such adjustment acted by the connecting element is easily to affect positions of both the left and right lens frames and therefore either the left lens frame or right lens frame cannot be well fitted to the eye sockets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, another type of swim goggles is improved by using two head straps respectively set along upper and lower sides of the left and right lens frames so as to adjust positions of the left and right lens frames individually and respectively. As a result, while adjusting one of the lens frames, the other one will not be affected. However, aforementioned conventional swim goggles are still used inconveniently or incapability when one of the lenses is needed to be replaced, such us the lens is broken or scratched or of different shortsighted degrees. Hence it is imperative to develop novel swim goggles of which lenses can be replaced separately, quickly and effectively and thereby overcome the foregoing drawbacks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide novel swim goggles of which a left lens frame and a right lens frame are detachably and separately assembled and adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the above-mentioned objects, a pair of swim goggles includes a connecting frame being assembled with a left lens frame and a right lens frame and a head strap, characterized in that the left and the right lens frames respectively having a lens and a frame body formed integrally with and around a periphery of the lens, an upper side and a lower side of the frame body respectively provided with a track thereon, the connecting frame including a middle portion, a first rib and a second rib being spaced apart from each other, and a pair of joint members for allowing the head strap being drawn therethrough, the first and the second ribs respectively defining a connection part thereon for being detachably coupled with the respective track, whereby the left and the right lens frames are detachably and separately assembled with the respective first rib and second rib and therefore are slidable with respect to the first and the second ribs though the track.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, the swim goggles <b>1</b> comprise a connecting frame <b>2</b> being assembled with a left lens frame <b>3</b>, a right lens frame <b>4</b>, a covering frame <b>5</b>, and a buckling apparatus <b>6</b> and a head strap <b>7</b> of a plurality of retaining slots <b>70</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), wherein the connecting frame <b>2</b> made of NYLON includes a middle portion <b>20</b>, a first rib <b>21</b> and a second rib <b>22</b> both extending longitudinally outwardly from opposite sides of the middle portion <b>20</b> and being spaced apart from each other, and a pair of joint members <b>23</b> for joining the first rib <b>21</b> and the second ribs <b>22</b> at one end thereof opposite to the middle portion <b>20</b>, respectively, and for allowing the head strap <b>7</b> being drawn through, wherein the middle portion <b>20</b> protrudes outwardly from the first and the second ribs, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and has a plurality of grooves <b>201</b> at the opposite sides thereof for providing better flexibility in order to fit various sizes of wearers' nose bridges. In addition, the middle portion <b>20</b> has a soft pad <b>24</b> which is made of Thermal Plastic Rubber (TPR) and formed integrally with the middle portion <b>20</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).
