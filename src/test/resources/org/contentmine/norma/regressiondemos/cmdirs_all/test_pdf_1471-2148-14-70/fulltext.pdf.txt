understanding of evolutionary processes. For many tropical large mammals, however, this aim is confounded by
the absence of fossil material and by the misleading signal obtained from genetic data of recently fragmented and
isolated populations. This is particularly true for the lion which as a consequence of millennia of human
persecution, has large gaps in its natural distribution and several recently extinct populations.
Results: We sequenced mitochondrial DNA from museum-preserved individuals, including the extinct Barbary lion
(Panthera leo leo) and Iranian lion (P. l. persica), as well as lions from West and Central Africa. We added these to a
broader sample of lion sequences, resulting in a data set spanning the historical range of lions. Our Bayesian
phylogeographical analyses provide evidence for highly supported, reciprocally monophyletic lion clades. Using a
molecular clock, we estimated that recent lion lineages began to diverge in the Late Pleistocene. Expanding
equatorial rainforest probably separated lions in South and East Africa from other populations. West African lions
then expanded into Central Africa during periods of rainforest contraction. Lastly, we found evidence of two
separate incursions into Asia from North Africa, first into India and later into the Middle East.
Conclusions: We have identified deep, well-supported splits within the mitochondrial phylogeny of African lions,
arguing for recognition of some regional populations as worthy of independent conservation. More morphological
and nuclear DNA data are now needed to test these subdivisions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/70challenging by its sparse African Pleistocene fossil record
[15], as well as large-scale, human-driven extirpations in
many parts of its historical range [16,17]. Widespread
hunting and anthropogenic changes to lion habitat are
continuing to reduce lion populations across their entire
range [6,18]. On the Kathiawar Peninsula in India, the
Asian lion subspecies P. leo persica survives as a popula-
tion of only ~400 individuals and has been classified as
“Endangered” by the IUCN [18]. Lions in Africa have ex-
perienced a suspected ~30% loss of the free-ranging popu-
lation in the past two decades and are now classified as
“Vulnerable” by the IUCN [18]. Of special concern are the
populations in West and Central Africa, which may be
close to extinction in the wild and are underrepresented
in the captive zoo population [19-21].
Despite this regional variation in population dynamics
and decline, all African lions are grouped under one
conservation heading as P. leo leo [18]. A lack of robust
data is a hindrance to producing an integrated and com-
prehensive evolutionary history for P. leo upon which to
test assumptions about evolutionarily significant units
[22]. Therefore, a better understanding of the evolutionary
relationships among modern lion populations is critical to
developing evidence-based plans for their conservation
and management.
Previous analyses of short fragments of the mitochon-
drial control region (hypervariable region I) from mod-
ern and recently extinct lion populations revealed
several distinct mitochondrial clades, but were unable to
provide strong statistical support for these groupings
[19,20,23,24]. Nonetheless, the extinct North African
Barbary lion and the Asian lion (including the extinct
Middle Eastern population) clearly form a mitochondrial
group that is distinct from all sub-Saharan African lions
[19,23]. This pattern is supported by morphological ana-
lyses that show similarities in cranial characters among
North African and Asian lions, and separate these two
populations from sub-Saharan African lions [25,26]. Re-
lationships among modern lions have also been studied
using longer sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b
(cytb) and nuclear DNA sampled from extant popula-
tions in eastern and southern Africa [27-29] and West
and Central Africa [20].
The results from genetic analyses have generally sup-
ported the accepted geographical subspecies designa-
tions [6,30], though confusion has occasionally arisen
when using voucher specimens from zoological collec-
tions to represent wild populations [31]. The Moroccan
Royal Lion collection, for example, has been used as a
proxy for extinct North African Barbary lions [e.g. 28],
despite the fact that mitochondrial studies have demon-
strated that these samples cluster with lions from Central
Africa, rather than North Africa [19,20]. These studies
have provided crucial information for understanding thephylogeographical relationships among modern lions. How-
ever, they were based on very short fragments of mito-
chondrial DNA, or samples drawn only from the extant
populations, or data sets that included individuals with
questionable geographical origins. For these reasons, there
is a clear need for the phylogeography of the modern lion
to be investigated using a robust molecular data set that
includes representatives of extinct populations.
In order to investigate the demographic and evolution-
ary history of African and Asian lions (Panthera leo,
sensu stricto), we have used a combination of ancient
and modern DNA sequences. We make use of a new ap-
proach that integrates spatial and Bayesian phylogenetic
analyses, allowing ancestral geographical states to be
co-estimated with the phylogeny, evolutionary rate, and
coalescence times [32]. We place this history into the
context of environmental changes in the late Quater-
nary and discuss whether the current taxonomic and
management paradigm reflects biological reality.
Methods
DNA extraction and amplification
We collected bone and tissue samples from known-origin
lion specimens kept in natural history collections (Table 1)
that had previously produced 130 bp sequences of the
HVR1 control region [19,23,33]. We extracted DNA using
an ion-exchange column method [34]. Briefly, we reduced
samples of cortical bone to powder in a mikrodismembra-
tor (Sartorius). We then digested bone powder overnight
at 50°C in 2 ml of buffer (0.425 M EDTA pH8, 1 mM
Tris–HCl pH8, 0.05% w/v SDS, 0.33 mg/ml Proteinase K)
under constant rotation. We concentrated the digested so-
lution to approximately 500 μl using centrifugal filters
with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa (Amicon® Ultra,
Millipore). We passed the concentrated solution through
a silica column (QIAquick®, Qiagen) following the manu-
facturer’s protocol, and eluted the final extract in 100 μl of
TE buffer. We measured DNA concentration (Table 1)
using 2 μl of extract on the Qubit® platform (Invitrogen),
and stored the extracts at -20°C.
We selected primers to amplify short (<200 bp) overlap-
ping fragments of mitochondrial cytb in order to maximize
the success rate of amplification from historical specimens.
We designed novel primers specific to Panthera leo that
minimized contaminant DNA sequences, and also selected
previously designed primers that successfully amplified
DNA from pantherine cats [35]. Nuclear inserts of mito-
chondrial regions are a known problem in pantherine
cats and we carefully selected primers that preferentially
amplified the cytoplasmic copy [36,37]. We used either
AmpliTaq® Gold (ABI) or KAPA2G™ Robust HotStart
(KAPA Biosystems) in PCRs according to manufacturers’
guidelines, with a 90 s activation step at 95°C, followed by
45 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, TA (Additional file 1: Figure S1,

Data analysis
Contigs were assembled in Se-Al v2.0a11 [38] and then
aligned with 74 previously published lion sequences
(Additional file 3: Table S1). For a subset of individuals,
both cytb and HVR1 control region sequences were
available (Additional file 3: Table S1). We did not identify
any nonsense or frameshift mutations in our data. In every
instance, overlapping contigs were complementary, includ-
ing overlaps where diagnostic mutations were also found
(Additional file 1: Figure S1, Additional file 2: Figure S2,
Additional file 3: Table S1, Additional file 4: Table S2
and Additional file 5: Table S1). Both individual amplicons
and assembled contigs showed greater similarity to mito-
chondrial sequences than to nuclear inserts of mitochon-
drial regions (Additional file 1: Figure S1, Additional file 2:tal DNA concentration, together with information on

To estimate the relationships among cytb haplotypes,
we generated a median network [39] using the median-
joining algorithm in the program Network v4.610 (www.
fluxus-engineering.com). More published sequences were
available on GenBank that consisted only of cytb than of
cytb + control region. Network analysis allowed us to con-
firm that congruent trees were inferred using both a
shorter DNA dataset containing more sequences and our
longer DNA dataset containing fewer sequences.
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed using
BEAST v1.7 [40]. The cytb and control region data were
concatenated (1186 bp) and the HKY substitution model
was selected for each region using the Bayesian informa-
tion criterion. This criterion has been shown to perform
well under a variety of simulation scenarios [41]. Owing to
the intraspecific nature of the data set, a strict molecular
clock was assumed and a separate rate was allowed for
each region. However, calibrating the molecular clock can
be difficult when the data set involves deep coalescence
events [42-44]. Although our data set includes ancient
DNA samples, they are not old enough to provide suffi-
cient calibrating information for the molecular clock [45].
Instead, we favour an approach that combines two sources
of calibrating information. First, we employed a previous
estimate of the substitution rate based on the control
Barnett et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2014, 14:70 Page 4 of 11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/70region of cave lions, calibrated using the radiocarbon dates
of the samples [45]. This was implemented using a normal
prior (mean 5.35×10−7 substitutions/site/year, standard
deviation 2.28×10−7 substitutions/site/year) for the substi-
tution rate of the control region. The mutation rate of
cytb, relative to the control region, was estimated in the
analysis. Second, we added a sequence from a cave lion, P.
leo spelaea, which allowed us to specify a calibration for
the divergence between P. leo leo and P. leo spelaea. We
used a normal prior with a mean of 550,000 years and
standard deviation of 25,000 years for the timing of this
split, based on the appearance of the ancestral cave lion P.
leo fossilis in the European fossil record [35,46].
An analysis using Bayes factors [47] supported a model
with constant population size as the best-fitting coales-
cent model for the data set. We obtained posterior esti-
mates of parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling. Samples were drawn every 1,000
steps over 10,000,000 MCMC steps, with the first 10%
discarded as burn-in. Acceptable sampling and conver-
gence to the stationary distribution were checked by in-
spection of traces using Tracer v1.5 [48].
For the phylogeographical analyses, we ran two inde-
pendent MCMC simulations of 50,000,000 steps each
using the discrete phylogeographical model described in
Edwards et al. [32]. We assigned each sequence to one of
seven geographical locations, broadly reflecting traditional
subspecies designations [6,30]: Middle East, Asia, Central
Africa, East Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and North
Africa (Table 1 and Additional file 3: Table S1), and esti-
mated rates of diffusion to and from each location. Set-
tings for the analysis matched those described above,
except we replaced the constant-size coalescent prior with
the flexible Gaussian Markov random field prior (skyride
plot; [49]).
Data authenticity
We employed strict protocols to eliminate contamination
and other potential artefacts [50]. We used only speci-
mens that had been shown previously to contain authentic
endogenous DNA [19,23,24,33]. DNA extractions were
performed in a physically isolated laboratory separated
from any modern molecular biology work, and in which
no work on felids had ever been attempted. Samples were
co-extracted with negative controls in extract:control
ratios of between 2:1 and 9:1. We used sterile reagents, fil-
tered pipette tips, and bleached and UV-irradiated sur-
faces and instruments. We set up PCRs in an isolated
facility, under positive air pressure in a dedicated sterile
hood, incorporating negative PCR and extraction controls.
Following set-up, we manually transported PCRs to a dif-
ferent laboratory for thermal cycling and post-PCR work.
We confirmed all putative novel mutations on the basis of
at least three independent PCRs (Additional file 1: Figure S1,Additional file 2: Figure S2, Additional file 3: Table S1,
Additional file 4: Table S2 and Additional file 5: Table S1).
Additionally, several specimens (PL1, PL4, PL13, PL15, and
PL16) produced sequences that were identical to those pre-
viously published for lions from nearby geographic regions.
Results
We amplified a 1051 bp fragment of cytb from 14
museum-preserved lions (Table 1). These lions were sam-
pled from extinct populations in North Africa and the
Middle East and endangered populations in West and
Central Africa (Figure 1).
From these, we identified four new mitochondrial hap-
lotypes: one from North Africa, one from a suspected
Barbary lion present in medieval London, one from Iran,
and one from Senegal. All other samples produced hap-
lotypes identical to published data and were compatible
with their geographical origin (Additional file 3: Table S1).
Four of the six Barbary lions exhibited a cytb sequence
identical to that of the extant Indian lion (Table 1 &
Additional file 3: Table S1).
Network analyses of North African and Asian cytb se-
quences show a simple starburst pattern with a basal
haplotype shared between North African and Indian
lions (Figure 2A). Additional diversity is represented by
Iranian lions that share a haplotype separated by a single
synonymous mutation from the central Indian haplo-
type, and a wild-shot North African lion and putative
Barbary lion from medieval England that differ by two
and three synonymous mutations, respectively.
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of combined cytb and
control region data suggests a clear clustering pattern in
which North African/Asian, western African, central Af-
rican, eastern-southern African, and southern African
lion populations are recognized, although the two South-
ern African clusters are not as internally coherent as the
other three clades (Figure 2B). The most recent common
ancestor of the five groups (node a in Figure 2B) was esti-
mated to have existed in the Late Pleistocene (124,200 years
BP, 95% HPD: 81,800-183,500). This date overlaps con-
siderably with two published estimates for the MRCA of
lions, 74,000-203,000 years BP [35] or 145,000-502,000 years
BP [28]. It should be noted that the external fossil calibra-
tion prior used in our analysis has had a substantial effect
on the estimates of divergence times when compared to
using only the internally calibrated mutation rate from the
control region data. If Panthera leo fossilis is a poor in-
dicator of the split between P.leo leo and P.leo spelaea,
then this would have concomitant effects on the diver-
gence estimate [44].
The phylogeographical methods also allowed us to es-
timate the divergence times of individual lion clades
(Figure 2B). The split between North African/Asian and
West and Central African lions (node b in Figure 2B)

took place approximately 61,500 years BP (95% HPD:
32,700-97,300). North African/Asian and West African
lions split (node c in Figure 2B) by approximately
51,000 years BP (95% HPD: 26,600-83,100). The move-
ment of lions out of Africa and into the Near-East/Asia
appears to have occurred in two recent waves. The first
expansion from North Africa (node f in Figure 2B) oc-
curred around 21,100 years BP (95% HPD: 8,300-38,800)
resulting in the major Asian lion clade, and the second
migration later produced the Middle-Eastern lion clade.
The geographical component incorporated into the
Bayesian analysis also allowed us to reconstruct ancestral
geographical states (Figures 2B and 3) and assign prob-
abilities to the movements. It should be noted that these
reconstructed movements are only based on maternally
inherited mitochondrial DNA, and are therefore subject
to future modification when biparentally inherited nu-
clear DNA becomes available. As suggested previously
[23,28], the geographical base of the lion tree is located
in sub-Saharan Africa, with movement between East andthis study. Numbers within circles correspond to PL numbers in

tion expanded into South Asia (Bayes factor: 4.37/4.50),
and then again into the Near East (Bayes factor: 21.03).
Discussion
Demographic and evolutionary history
We identified a Late Pleistocene origin for all five major
phylogeographical groups of the modern lion (Figure 2),
thus providing additional support for a single-African-
origin model. This model was first proposed by Yamaguchi
et al. [14] based on morphology, distribution, and parietal
art and has been reinforced by aDNA studies of extinct
Late Pleistocene lions [23,24,35]. Additional analyses of
ancient DNA from historical examples of modern lions
suggest that sub-Saharan Africa, with a tentatively identi-
fied focal point in eastern-southern Africa, was the likely
evolutionary cradle of the modern lion [23]. The eastern-

and lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) sequences
amplified from 357 modern East African, South African

amongst eastern-southern African lions (Figure 2), also
support the idea that the evolutionary cradle of the mod-
ern lion was in eastern-southern Africa.
Our results suggest a very late date for the most recent
common ancestor of all five phylogeographical groups.
Burger et al. [35] previously concluded that the most re-
cent common ancestor of the modern lion lived 74–203
thousand years BP based on mitochondrial cytb se-
quences calibrated with fossil data from P. leo fossilis.
Antunes et al. [28] suggested c. 145–502 thousand years
BP for a major range expansion of the modern lion, in-
cluding the colonization of south-western Eurasia based
on mtDNA (12S and 16S rRNA genes). Although our es-
timate of the divergence time overlaps with both previ-
ous estimates, we demonstrate that the modern lion

This analysis has not previously been possible due to the
extinction of sister populations in North Africa and

DNA.
Our use of statistical phylogeography and DNA se-
quences from purported refugial regions allows us to re-
construct the past movements of lion populations and
place them in the context of palaeoclimatic evidence.
Late Pleistocene Africa experienced massive, sudden
fluctuations in hydrology caused by the glacial/intergla-
cial cycle, with concomitant effects on vegetation and
biome distribution [51-53]. More specifically, several
episodes of rapid cycling between high humidity and
aridity have been identified from the palynological rec-
ord [51,53,54], with the three most recent humid phases
having occurred during Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5,
120-110Ka), Marine Isotope stage 3 (MIS3, 50-45Ka)
and the early Holocene (10-6Ka) [55-57]. During pe-
riods of high humidity, tropical rainforest expanded
across the equatorial region, and the Sahara became sa-
vanna [52,55,56]. Conversely, during periods of high

refugia as the Sahara expanded [51,52,54,56]. The timing
and nature of these changes correlate well with inferred
patterns of lion diversification and suggest a mechanism
to explain the phylogeographical patterning of lions in
Africa and Asia.
During the Middle Pleistocene, prior to MIS5, lions
were probably widespread over Africa, occupying regions
of savanna/scrub-woodland. During the humid period of
MIS5, tropical rainforest expansion eastward from the
Gulf of Guinea to the Great Rift Valley would have iso-
lated southern and eastern African populations from
western and northern populations, corresponding to the
basal divergence among lion lineages ~124,200 years BP
(95% HPD: 81,800-183,500). As aridity increased, leading
into MIS4, the Sahara expanded and separated lion pop-
ulations in North Africa and West Africa. This climaticB

The contraction of tropical rainforests, as the contin-
ent dried, permitted the expansion of lions from West
Africa into newly open biomes in central Africa, and a
signal of this movement is recovered by the statistical
phylogeographical analysis. At the same time, there is
evidence for a complicated interaction between popula-
tions in East and South Africa, with the Rift Valley po-
tentially acting as a partial barrier to dispersal. Lastly,
our phylogenetic and demographic reconstructions pro-

ation between West African and Central African lions
occurs in the region between Benin and Cameroon, an
area bisected by the Niger River (Figure 3). Similarly, the
Central African lions appear to be bounded by the Nile
on their eastern front, separating them from the Eastern
African group (Figure 3), though the sparse sampling
from this region makes identifying barriers difficult. The
influence of large rivers on African mammal phylogeo-
graphy has been demonstrated for chimpanzees and bo-
nobos (Pan spp.), where the Niger River may act as a
subspecies barrier [60]. Other African savannah ungu-
lates, such as giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) also show
a congruent pattern [5]. Similarly, large rivers appear to
act as biogeographic boundaries to a certain extent, even
for the jaguar (Panthera onca) which is renowned for its
ability to swim [61]. It is probable that deserts, valleys,
and rivers and watershed boundaries have all acted to
maintain the phylogeographical structure of lions.
Conservation
Our analyses recovered five major phylogeographical
groups in the modern lion: North African/Asian, West
African, Central African, South African, and East-South
African. All of these could be designated as Evolutionar-
ily Significant Units (ESUs) in the absence of conflicting
morphological or nuclear DNA data [62] (Figure 2). This
pattern is consistent with previous studies based on con-
trol region data from across the species range [23], and
studies using other mitochondrial regions to examine de-
tailed phylogeographical patterns in sub-Saharan Africa
[27,28] and western-central Africa [20].
International bodies currently recognize only two lion
conservation units: African and Asian lions [18] on the
basis of early attempts to categorize lions using crude
allozyme separation [63,64]. DNA sequence studies havelions dispersing during the mid-late Holocene. The re-
cent dates for emigration to Asia are interesting because
lion remains have been found from throughout the Late
Pleistocene in the Middle East [58,59]. However, the
genetic data presented here only reflect the most re-
cently arrived populations in the region. Populations that
resulted from earlier expansions are unlikely to be de-
tected since their genetic signatures would have been
overwritten by those of later expansions.
The identification of well-supported phylogeographical
groups of lions naturally prompts the question of what
has maintained these divisions. Several obvious dispersal
barriers have been proposed in previous publications, in-
cluding the Great Rift Valley [27], tropical rainforests
[20], and the Sahara [26], though other topographic ob-
stacles are also likely to have played a role. The separ-questioned these widely accepted legislative conservation
units because the current dichotomy does not coincidewith the intraspecific phylogeny estimated using a wider
sampling regime [19,20,23,28].
Our results further suggest that this dichotomy requires
revision (Figure 2). The mitochondrial data clearly show
that Asian lions are nested within the diversity present in
Central, West, and North Africa. Perhaps Panthera leo
persica should be treated as consubspecific with Panthera
leo leo, or alternatively the other phylogeographical groups
could be considered for elevation to the same status. Of
particular concern are the central African and western
African populations, which may be close to extinction,
with estimates of ~800 lions in West Africa and ~900
lions in Central Africa [65]. Our data confirm the distinct
nature of western African lions and the need to afford
them appropriate protection [66]. At the same time, we
encourage a careful approach when discussing ESUs based
on mtDNA, rather than morphology or nuclear DNA, due
to the scale-dependent and static nature of many units
(see [23] for detailed arguments).
The close phylogenetic relationships among Barbary,
Iranian, and Indian lion populations are noteworthy given
their considerable geographical separation (Figures 1 and 2).
Nonetheless, the extinct North African Barbary lion har-
boured appreciable genetic diversity prior to extirpation,
including unique cytb haplotypes (Table 1, Figure 2A). In-
dividuals PL3 and PL12 (Table 1) differ from the majority
haplotype, though neither sample is associated with a spe-
cific provenance. PL3 was collected in “Barbary” according
to museum notes, whereas PL12 was kept in the Tower of
London during the 15th Century and its North African
origin has only recently been identified [33]. In compari-
son to the Barbary lions from Tunisia and Algeria, the di-
vergent haplotypes might reflect the historical presence of
additional population subdivisions within North African
lions (e.g., Atlas Mountains and Mediterranean coast popula-
tions), evidence of a large, diverse, panmictic population, or
incomplete lineage sorting. Barbary lion samples with precise
provenance data would be needed to resolve the issue.
The restoration of the extinct North African Barbary
lion has attracted the attention of conservationists both
inside and outside North Africa [19,31,67,68]. Although
circumstantial evidence suggested that the Barbary lion
could have survived in captivity [67,68], the most likely
descendants of wild Barbary lions from the Moroccan
Royal Menagerie do not appear to be (maternally) Barbary
[19, this study]. However, there is a close mitochondrial
relationship between the Barbary lion and the extant In-
dian lion, and this has been tentatively (but independently)
supported by non-molecular studies [26,30].
In the tiger, another charismatic felid species, studies
of ancient mitochondrial DNA have suggested a close
relationship between the extinct central Asian Caspian
tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) and the extant Amur tiger
(P. t. altaica) [69]. This has allowed conservationists to
Barnett et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2014, 14:70 Page 9 of 11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/70discuss the translocation of Amur tiger stock to occupy
the former range of the Caspian tiger [70], with support
from the World Tiger Summit [71]. Similarly, if no ex-
amples of purebred Barbary lions can be found within
the zoo population, there might be scope for restoration
of the North African lion population using the closely
related Indian lion.
Conclusion
Ancient DNA, in combination with Bayesian phylogeo-
graphical analysis, has enabled us to infer a maternal
evolutionary and demographic history of the lion that
would be impossible using modern data alone. The in-
clusion of representatives of populations from North
Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, and the Middle East
fills major gaps in our understanding of the past and
present distribution of lions and our analysis has led to
two major findings. Firstly, our identification of the in-
fluence of cyclical changes in African climate, and of the
expansion from refugia in western, southern and north-
ern Africa, highlight the importance of these regions for
lion diversity. Secondly, population subdivisions identified
here are sufficiently divergent to warrant recognition as
ESUs. Our data regarding these ESUs will greatly aid
conservation planning of these important taxa over the
complete natural range of modern lions.
These data can now also be used to help establish the likely
provenance of zoo lions, as an assessment before potential
inclusion in ex-situ breeding programmes. The search should
now focus on nuclear markers to expand and confirm the
subdivisions we have identified. The need for this will be-
come increasingly clear as the unique lion populations of
sub-Saharan Africa edge closer to endangered status.
