We sought to evaluate whether their genetic diversity and structure have changed over this period of habitat decline, how their current genetic patterns compare with past patterns, and how genetic demography changed with ancient fluctuations in climate. Characterizing their circumpolar genetic structure using microsatellite data, we defined four clusters that largely correspond to current ecological and oceanographic factors: Eastern Polar Basin, Western Polar Basin, Canadian Archipelago and Southern Canada. We document evidence for recent (ca. last 1&#x02013;3 generations) directional gene flow from Southern Canada and the Eastern Polar Basin towards the Canadian Archipelago, an area hypothesized to be a future refugium for polar bears as climate-induced habitat decline continues. Our data provide empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis. The direction of current gene flow differs from earlier patterns of gene flow in the Holocene. From analyses of mitochondrial DNA, the Canadian Archipelago cluster and the Barents Sea subpopulation within the Eastern Polar Basin cluster did not show signals of population expansion, suggesting these areas may have served also as past interglacial refugia. Mismatch analyses of mitochondrial DNA data from polar and the paraphyletic brown bear (<italic>U. arctos</italic>) uncovered offset signals in timing of population expansion between the two species, that are attributed to differential demographic responses to past climate cycling. Mitogenomic structure of polar bears was shallow and developed recently, in contrast to the multiple clades of brown bears. We found no genetic signatures of recent hybridization between the species in our large, circumpolar sample, suggesting that recently observed hybrids represent localized events. Documenting changes in subpopulation connectivity will allow polar nations to proactively adjust conservation actions to continuing decline in sea-ice habitat.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for collection and analysis of new samples was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Changing Arctic Ecosystem Initiative and is supported by funding from the Wildlife Program of the USGS Ecosystem Mission Area, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Toronto Zoo Endangered Species Fund, Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Wildlife Management Board, Makivik Corporation, Polar Continental Shelf Program, Norwegian Polar Institute, World Wildlife Fund, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

As habitat undergoes change, populations expand or become increasingly isolated. Because habitat change due to climate warming has been and is predicted to be most dramatic at the poles and especially for sea-ice habitat <xref rid="pone.0112021-Gillett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, Arctic species are expected to undergo dramatic shifts in distribution that may affect their viability <xref rid="pone.0112021-Post1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Since 1979, the spatial extent of Arctic sea-ice in autumn has declined by over 9% per decade through 2010 <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stroeve1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recent modeling predicts that nearly ice-free summers will characterize the Arctic before mid-century. However, as sea-ice loss is occurring &#x0201c;faster than forecasted&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stroeve1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, the first nearly ice-free Arctic summer could occur as soon as 2016 <xref rid="pone.0112021-Overland1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The polar bear (<italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>), a specialist carnivore whose survival depends on sea-ice for foraging, migration and mating, is expected to be increasingly at risk due to changes in sea-ice habitat <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stirling1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One modeling effort that included projections of future sea-ice conditions forecasted that two-thirds of the circumpolar population might be extirpated within half a century <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and climate warming slowed <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These observations and expectations prompted the listing of the polar bear as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List in 2006 and as a threatened species in the United States in 2008. Subsequently, the 5 nations where polar bears occur are now developing a circumpolar management plan <xref rid="pone.0112021-Vongraven1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> outlining conservation actions and research needed to understand how the species will respond to changing habitat. Initial research has shown that decreasing metrics of sea-ice extent have been associated with declining polar bear body condition <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stirling2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112021-Rode2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, survival <xref rid="pone.0112021-Regehr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112021-Peacock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and population size <xref rid="pone.0112021-Regehr2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, although effects of sea-ice decline on polar bears are variable <xref rid="pone.0112021-Peacock2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Rode3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Using global circulation models (GCMs) and polar bear habitat-use data, Durner et al. <xref rid="pone.0112021-Durner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> predicted that mean summer polar bear optimal habitat in the Polar Basin (approximately 50% of the most northerly portion of polar bear range) will decrease by 68% by the end of the 21st century. Although with &#x0201c;faster than forecasted&#x0201d; observations of the rate of sea-ice reduction <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stroeve1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Overland1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, this timeline will likely be compressed. At the scale of the polar bear's entire circumpolar range, changes in sea-ice phenology and quality are predicted to influence the demographics <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Molnar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, connectivity <xref rid="pone.0112021-Derocher1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, degree of genetic isolation <xref rid="pone.0112021-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and therefore viability, of the 19 global semi-discrete subpopulations recognized by the IUCN/Polar Bear Specialist Group <xref rid="pone.0112021-Obbard1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Though movement of individual polar bears across present-day subpopulation boundaries is evident from capture-recapture data and hunter tag returns <xref rid="pone.0112021-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, satellite telemetry <xref rid="pone.0112021-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and genetic surveys <xref rid="pone.0112021-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Paetkau1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Zeyl1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the IUCN subpopulation boundaries were originally developed based on patterns of sea-ice formation and melt, and observations of polar bear seasonal fidelity. Though polar bears are currently thought to constitute a panmictic, single evolutionary unit <xref rid="pone.0112021-Paetkau1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, reduced range and habitat connectivity may increasingly fragment subpopulations resulting in transient refugia and meta-population dynamics. Some subpopulations may become more productive, whereas others may become less viable <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stirling1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There is already evidence of change in the contemporary distribution of polar bears. For example, polar bears, once common in Newfoundland <xref rid="pone.0112021-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, are now seen there only infrequently and in small numbers. Similarly, polar bears once regularly summered on St. Lawrence and St. Matthew islands in the Bering Sea <xref rid="pone.0112021-Packard1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112021-Elliot1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Now they are irregularly observed in the Bering Sea and do not spend summers on St. Matthew Island. Although these changes in polar bear distribution may also have been related to overharvest, the recent reductions in the extent of sea-ice due would prevent current and regular use of these areas.</p><p>Future responses of polar bears to declining habitat may mirror their responses during past fluctuations in climate. Paleodemographic genetic estimates using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have suggested that polar bear evolution and effective population size have tracked key climate events, similar to the paraphyletic brown bear (<italic>U. arctos</italic>). Both species experienced fluctuations in effective population size throughout their history, including prolonged declines over the past 500,000 years, although this decline is more pronounced in polar bears <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Population fluctuations of brown and polar bears appear to be offset, with population size in brown bears decreasing, and in polar bears increasing, during Pleistocene cooling events <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This offset is consistent with observations from other paired boreal and Arctic species, including voles (<italic>Microtus</italic> spp.) and shrews (<italic>Sorex</italic> spp.; <xref rid="pone.0112021-Hope1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>). Periodic hybridization between the two species of bears has resulted in conflicting estimates of divergence time, presence of polar bear-like mtDNA in certain extant <xref rid="pone.0112021-Cronin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112021-Talbot1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and extinct <xref rid="pone.0112021-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112021-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> brown bear populations, and long stretches of polar bear nuclear DNA in the brown bear genome <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Cahill1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Signatures of admixture are consistent with overlapping distributional ranges (and habitat) of both species in some areas, and viable hybrids recently have been documented in wild populations <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stirling3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The rate and periodicity of hybridization events through time may result from shifting ranges of one or both species in response to climatic change <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Hence, connectivity among subpopulations of polar bears, and interactions between polar bears and brown bears, will continue to change during the current period of sea-ice decline.</p><p>In this paper, we use mtDNA and neutral microsatellite DNA data to establish the historical and current genetic structure and gene flow dynamics in polar bears across their entire circumpolar range, and specifically among the subpopulation units that are used for polar bear management. We employ clustering techniques <xref rid="pone.0112021-Pritchard1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Corander1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> to evaluate underlying circumpolar structure, which may be cryptic and not necessarily related to subpopulation boundaries <xref rid="pone.0112021-Cronin2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. By using coalescent theory <xref rid="pone.0112021-Beerli1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, we examine historical (mtDNA) and modern (microsatellite) asymmetries in gene flow among clusters of subpopulations to determine the underlying connectivity. We assess symmetry in gene flow during the period of very recent climate warming and ice habitat decline with Bayesian methods <xref rid="pone.0112021-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We also directly compare polar bear samples from the 1980s through the 2010s (over &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3 generations), to test for temporal shifts in genetic structure within subpopulations. We further determine the extent of sex-bias in gene flow as a mechanism underlying connectivity of subpopulations of polar bears. We compare the polar bear mtDNA data to similar data in the brown bear, to provide context to the analyses of phylogenetic structure, historical population fluctuations and gene flow in polar bears during historical climate fluctuations. We also address recent hypotheses about the relationship between modern polar bears and brown bears <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Cahill1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive baseline of historical and contemporary genetic structure for polar bears, throughout their circumpolar range, which will complement ecological and evolutionary research, provide a framework for effective conservation actions <xref rid="pone.0112021-Thiemann1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Peacock3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and provide a geographically comprehensive baseline for future assessment and management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Data were used from samples collected in previously permitted research studies between 1973 and 2006 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;869; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112021.s018">S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112021.s018">S12 Tables</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0112021-Paetkau1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Zeyl1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>).

The directional gene flow from the Eastern Polar Basin to the Canadian Archipelago and Western Polar Basin is specifically contemporary (past 1&#x02013;3 generations; <sc>bayesass</sc> analyses of microsatellite DNA), occurring during this current era of sea-ice decline. Estimates of asymmetry in historical gene flow did not show a similar pattern: coalescent estimates of asymmetry in gene flow (<sc>migrate</sc> analyses) did not show directionality based on maternally-inherited mtDNA (late Pleistocene signature), or on microsatellite DNA (Holocene signature).

This directional gene flow from the Eastern Polar Basin cluster towards the Canadian Archipelago and Western Polar Basin clusters is supported by predominant seasonal ice movement from the Eastern Polar Basin (e.g., Laptev Sea) towards the northern edge of the Canadian Archipelago and northern Greenland i.e., part of the Beaufort Gyre <xref rid="pone.0112021-Colony1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. As the extent of sea-ice continues to decrease in response to climate change, the northern edge of the Canadian Archipelago and adjacent areas of the Polar Basin are predicted to retain the last vestiges of summer and autumn sea-ice habitat <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Durner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our findings constitute empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis. Note although the Beaufort Gyre moves ice from the western portion of the Western Polar Basin towards the Canadian Archipelago, we did not detect gene flow in this particular direction.</p><p>Throughout the Holocene, polar bears in the Canadian Archipelago have had year-round access to sea-ice from which to hunt for seals. Conversely, in much of the seasonal-ice ecoregion <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> in the eastern Arctic and subarctic of Canada (i.e., our Southern Canada cluster), polar bears spend several months fasting ashore. The climate warming of recent decades <xref rid="pone.0112021-Gillett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> has led to earlier break-up of sea ice and longer ice-free seasons in these subpopulations of the Southern Canada cluster. Decreased body condition, lower survival, and reduced abundance of polar bears in some of subpopulations in the Southern Canada cluster have been linked to these sea ice changes <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stirling2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Rode2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Regehr2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but see <xref rid="pone.0112021-Peacock2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). In contrast, some researchers hypothesize the Canadian Archipelago will become more productive habitat for polar bears as annual ice over shallow waters (better conditions for seal prey) will replace thick, multi-year and less productive ice habitat <xref rid="pone.0112021-Stirling1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Derocher et al. <xref rid="pone.0112021-Derocher1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and Durner et al. <xref rid="pone.0112021-Durner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> predicted such a northerly shift in polar bears as productive habitat changes as a result of climate warming. Our empirical gene flow data support this prediction. In addition to patterns of ice movement within the Polar Basin, and changes in availability of preferred polar bear habitat, evidence of net gene flow into the Canadian Archipelago and Western Polar Basin may also be influenced by asymmetries in harvest pressure. The Canadian Archipelago and the Western Polar Basin have at least 2.8 times and 1.5 times, respectively, higher polar bear harvest than in the Eastern Polar Basin <xref rid="pone.0112021-Obbard1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> in which only the East Greenland subpopulation is harvested.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Contemporary Genetic Structure</title><p>Our examination of asymmetry in gene flow was based on results of Bayesian clustering which grouped the circumpolar population of polar bears into three or four regional genetic clusters that represent patterns of breeding within the recent Holocene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112021-g002">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Generally, individual polar bears from entire subpopulations were assigned to one of three regional clusters. The exception was the Davis Strait subpopulation, which was split between two regional clusters: Southern Canada and the Canadian Archipelago. Targeted Bayesian analyses also supported the further division of the Polar Basin cluster into the Eastern and Western Polar Basins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112021.s003">S3c Fig</xref>.). Although three regional groupings were also uncovered using traditional metrics (AMOVA analyses of both microsatellite loci and mtDNA), only mtDNA AMOVA analyses supported the presence of the four regional clusters uncovered using Bayesian clustering, which includes the eastern and western Polar Basin split (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112021.s013">S7 Table</xref>). The greater level of population and regional structuring uncovered using data from the maternally-inherited mtDNA relative to the biparentally-inherited nuclear microsatellite loci is not surprising. Pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values for microsatellite loci are generally lower than expected based on <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values for mtDNA, reflecting hypothesized greater levels of philopatry among females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112021.s004">S4 Fig</xref>.).</p><p>Oceanographic patterns of ice formation, ice melt, and the convergence and divergence of ice from shore create different ecological circumstances for polar bears <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> that likely contribute to these clustering patterns. The Canadian Archipelago cluster is confined by narrow, shallow straits between islands, insulating the region from the ice dynamics of the Polar Basin. The Canadian Archipelago was identified by Amstrup et al. <xref rid="pone.0112021-Amstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> as one of four unique eco-regions for polar bears. Three subpopulations &#x02013; Kane Basin, Baffin Bay and the more northerly region of Davis Strait &#x02013; group with the subpopulations in the Canadian Archipelago proper (Lancaster Sound, Norwegian Bay, M'Clintock Channel, Viscount Melville, Gulf of Boothia) into the Canadian Archipelago genetic cluster. This is consistent with a general northerly seasonal ice movement and the directional gene flow towards the Canadian Archipelago. The grouping of these additional subpopulations with the Canadian Archipelago proper supports the proposed &#x0201c;Central Arctic&#x0201d; conservation unit of polar bears defined based on ecological similarities <xref rid="pone.0112021-Thiemann1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>The Southern Canada cluster includes subpopulations in the Hudson Bay ecological complex <xref rid="pone.0112021-Thiemann1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112021-Peacock4" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, for which breeding habitat overlaps in central Hudson Bay <xref rid="pone.0112021-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Polar bears sampled south of Hudson Strait in the Davis Strait subpopulation also clustered with the Hudson Bay complex of polar bears. The marked genetic differences between southern and northern Davis Strait bears must reflect differences in southern versus northern breeding areas in the spring. However, polar bears in Davis Strait were largely sampled in the fall; this suggests that the fidelity to the two subregions within Davis Strait is year-round. Polar bears occupying southern and northern Davis Strait also differ in diet <xref rid="pone.0112021-Iverson1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref> and rates of survival and recruitment <xref rid="pone.0112021-Peacock2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Yet, our failure to detect shifts in distributions of alleles within the nine subpopulations of polar bears that were sampled over the past three decades (i.e., 1980s-early 2010s), indicate that demographic fluctuations during the past several generations have been insufficient to influence genetic partitioning of subpopulations within regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Historical Response to Changing Climates</title><p>Mismatches between expansions and contractions of polar bears and brown bears appear to coincide with past climate fluctuations. We timed the expansion of Western Polar Basin polar bears to the early Wisconsin glacial period (approximately 98,000 years ago), preceding the expansion of Western Beringian brown bears before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 31,000 years ago, and Eastern Beringian brown bears during the last glacial at &#x0223c;56,000 years ago.

Deep nuclear genomic sequencing suggested that brown bear effective population size apparently increased during the last interglacial (approximately 130&#x02013;114 kya), and decreased during the last glacial period. The opposite pattern was uncovered for polar bears, which showed a marked increase in population size coincident with Pleistocene cooling, and a decrease coincident with climate warming associated with the last interglacial <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

The latter estimate may reflect the capture of the polar bear mitogenome by brown bears, due to a hybridization event, rather than the initial divergence of the species. Analysis of mitogenomic data, including data from an ancient (120,000 year old) fossil polar bear, suggests an age for the extant polar bear matrilineage of less than 45,000 years, consistent with recent and rapid growth of modern polar bear populations toward the end of the last Pleistocene glacial but prior to the LGM <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

Analysis of entire mitogenomes from brown and polar bears <xref rid="pone.0112021-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, however, places their common matrilineal ancestor (from the Alexander Archipelago) at ca. 152 kya, with radiation of the modern polar bear mitochondrial crown group at ca. 44 kya.
