Introduction
1.1 Why Detectors ?
Probably the first human being already was driven by a strong sense of curiosity, as it is some of the
deepest law of human nature. This force has pushed mankind to develop more and more powerful
investigation tools to help him understand its environment. Outstanding examples in the past are the
telescope used by Galile´e to make the first observation for Jupiter’s satellites, or Van Leewenhoek ’s
microscope, which enabled the discovery of microscopic animals... In this frame, X-rays are nothing
but an extension to humans’ capabilities to explore the world, and X-ray detectors are their eyes,
adapted for such investigations.
This work is intended to contribute to the development of modern tools for matter studies. It is part
of a more global program to provide modern light sources with reliable and efficient detectors, able
to answer the growing needs of the scientific community in this domain.
2 Introduction
1.1.1 A small history of X-ray sources
Figure 1.1 : Conrad Wilhelm RO¨NTGEN (March
27, 1845 - February 10, 1923), German physicist. Figure 1.2 : Brilliance of various light sources.
The brilliance enables to measure the quality of a
light source.
Since their first identification by Wilhelm Ro¨ntgen in the late 18th century (for which he was awarded
the first Nobel Prize for Physics in 1901), X-rays have been at the origins of several revolutions in
numerous fields of research.
This broadening of the usefulness of X-rays is mainly due to the fantastic development of X-ray
sources. The following lines give a short history of those sources.
Discharge tubes or Crookes tube
William Crookes, an English physicist, is the inventor of the first artificial source of X-rays: while he
was studying the effects of electric currents in gas at low pressure, he used glass vacuum cylinders,
containing electrodes for discharges of a high voltage electric current1. He noticed that unexposed
photographic plates were shadowed when approached from those tubes, even though he did not
identify this to be caused by a particular sort of radiation.
Fernando Sanford later bettered this principle of emissions and published in 1893 in the Journal
Physical Review an article entitledObserved tubes with energy rays extending from a negative electrode.
It is interesting to note that even after deeper studies by Heinrich Hertz of those specific radiations,
they were not identified as a new sort of radiation. Only the work of Wilhelm Ro¨ntgen with Vacuum
tubes enabled to actually identify X-rays as a new kind of ray.
Those tubes are actually the ancestors of modern X-ray tubes, which are the result of a technological
1this sort of tube had already been used by the physicist Johann Hittorf who observed tubes with energy rays
extending from a negative electrode.

improvement of the original Crookes tube.
Synchrotron radiation sources
Figure 1.3 : The General electric particle accelerator, at the origin of the discovery of synchrotron radiations.
The arrow indicates the trace of the synchrotron radiation beam on the picture. It is the first observation of
synchrotron radiations.
The history of synchrotron radiations is closely related to that of particle physics. First considered
as a nuisance sapping the energy of the particles, it was later recognized as a powerful tool to study
matter. One usually distinguishes three major steps on the way to modern light sources:
First Generation Sources were mainly synchrotrons built for the study of particle physics (High
Energy Physics HEP), which were refurbished as light sources, as the frontiers of HEP were
pushed forward. This way, it is often said that the use of those synchrotrons as light sources
was a sort of parasitic operation of the synchrotrons. A big step occurred in the 50’s as
the first electron storage rings were built, providing a much more stable, fixed energy, and
continuous beam of particles (and thus photon beam). Those machines have been the models
for all synchrotron light sources until now.
Second Generation Sources were the first machines dedicated for light emission. They were the
first machines able to operate a large number of beamlines, with optimized emittance parameters
(quality of the beam), stable energy and beam position. The development of those machines
4 Introduction
was associated to important developments in optics and gave birth to new types of experiments
such as EXAFS or large protein crystallography.
Third Generation Sources are storage rings optimized to have numerous long straight sections,
in which undulators and wrigglers can take place, so providing a much higher brightness and
flux of photon beams. This is the birth of large facilities (800 to 1400m) offering several tens
of beamlines, typically welcoming several thousands of users every year.
The future of light sources will probably see a parallel development of the third generation light
sources, which keep bettering in terms of performance, and the birth of the fourth generation sources,
also called Free electron lasers (FEL). FEL will be able to offer peak of brightness of several
order of magnitude higher than third generation sources, as well as pulses as short as 100 fs and
highly coherent. FELs will be constituted of very long undulators in high-energy linear accelerators.
Those devices will offer a new range of possibility of investigation of matter, but will not directly
compete with third generation sources as they will not be able to offer the many beamlines that
storage rings have.
Indeed, several projects of third and fourth generation sources have been launched recently or are
even in their commissioning phase (the synchrotrons Diamond and Soleil in Oxford and Paris, the
European X-FEL in Hamburg...). Yet it is unlikely that all those sources will be able to answer the
growing demand for high brightness sources.
1.1.2 A new Science is born: Photon Science

brightness photon beams.©P.Ginter/ESRF.
Photon Sciences encompass all the techniques using high brilliance photon beams, such as those pro-
duced in Synchrotron Radiation Facilities, and Free Electron Lasers. Those sophisticated and perma-
nently evolving machines enable the production of highly intense beams of photons. The brilliance
(which measures the quality of the beam) is now more than 10 orders of magnitudes higher than that
of conventional sources (see Figure 1.2).
1.1 Why Detectors ? 5
Among those new generation sources, a majority of them are dedicated to the production of X-rays,
and to the development of techniques making use of them.
Since their first direct application (photography of Wilhelm Ro¨ntgen’s wife’s hand), X-rays have
become the base of applications as various as:
Medical imaging and treatment: radiography techniques, scanners, cancer treatments, computer to-
mography, are just some of the numerous applications of X-rays in medicine.
Now modern sources have pushed the development of new techniques, like: high-resolution
3D tomography imaging techniques, therapeutic treatments, drugs research,
Physics: Numerous physical characterization techniques are based on X-rays. If historically X-rays
first enabled the study of crystals by mean of the crystallography, they are now routinely
used to study soft matter (diffuse scattering), the chemical composition of elements (spec-
troscopy), magnetic structures (magnetic scattering-magnetic dichroism), the surface and
interface properties of various materials (small angle scattering) etc...
Biology. Biology always beneficiated from the development of physics techniques for its development
(the structure of DNA was discovered thanks to the X-ray diffraction technique). Now a
wide range of techniques is specifically devoted to biological applications: macromolecular
crystallography has become a science on its own, and more and more techniques benefit
from developments specific to biological applications.
Archeology and art. Archeological and artistic pieces are by definition unique and fragile. Since most
X-ray based techniques are non destructive, they are of prime interest to learn more on
those precious ”samples”.

a tomographic technique.
For example it is now possible to know with a precision better than one Angstrom, the position of
each atoms in biological macromolecules (typically several thousands of amino acids). One can find
in all kind of samples the rarest traces of impurities, and get extremely useful information on the
history of the sample, or on its composition. It is possible to reconstruct in 3 dimensions the structure
of various samples with a precision of the order of a few microns, to determine the inner structure of
micro-objects, and directly study the properties of nanometer size objects...
6 Introduction
Another big advantage is the fact that those analysis are mostly non destructive.
→ It is possible to study unique samples, like archeological objects or space objects (brought
back by various space missions or even by the fall of asteroids)
→ It is possible to follow in situ complex process like chemical or biological reactions with a time
resolution of the picosecond or even less.
→ It enables eventually to repeat the experiment, which is not always easy to do when the sample
itself is hard to make.
→ It is possible to combine different techniques on the same sample.
As a result, there are more and more ”photon factories” in the world to answer the growing need
of scientists for those techniques of analysis. Experiments, which were just impossible to do even
20 years ago are now routinely achieved in synchrotrons and have become the standard in a lot
of fields. The area of interest for synchrotrons and the future X-FELs also keeps growing as new
applications (such as medical applications, nano-analysis) arise and revolutionize the possibilities in
their respective fields.
In the future, it is likely that the demand for high quality sources will keep growing, especially with
the arrival of more and more hybrid techniques, combining various apparatus like electron imaging
combined with magnetic dichroism imaging or atomic force microscopes combined with nano-focused
photon beams, LEED analysis and photoemission spectroscopy...
1.1.3 A typical experimental setup
An experiment using high quality sources involves a lot of elements, each being highly optimized.
A typical beamline (where the photon beams is shaped and positioned, and where experiments are
carried out ) is almost always composed of four main parts (see fig. 1.7):
• A source
• An optics hutch,
• An experimental hutch,
• A control hutch.
The source is composed of the particles circulating in the storage ring. Charged particles like
electrons or positrons used in synchrotrons emit light when submitted to acceleration. For those
particles have a very high energy (several GeV), the emitted light is tangential to their direction of
motion. This results in a very concentrated beam with a low divergence, and high flux.

controlled from the control cabin.
The storage ring in reality is a large polygon. At each of its angles one can find bending magnets,
which produce an intense magnetic field, where the particles trajectory is bent. This is also the place
where light is produced. Beamline find their origins in those bending magnets.
In addition, elements called insertion devices are specifically made to produce a very large flux (see
picture 1.10 for the example of an undulator). Those elements consist of straight sections in which an
alternative magnetic field is applied on the pathway of particles (with a small period and permanent
magnet they are called undulators, and with long period electromagnets, they are called wigglers).
In those elements the particles follow a zigzag trajectory. The quantity of light obtained is largely
increased, as each turn adds light to that of the previous one, and because the emitted light is all
emitted in the direction of the straight section and not spread all along a large curve, like in bending
magnets.
In the case of undulators (small period) the light emitted by the device is coherent enough (spatially
and temporally) to create a phenomenon of interference. This results in the concentration of the
emitted energies at a fundamental frequency and a few harmonics. The Figure 1.9 gives the respective
spectrums of a bending magnet, a wiggler and an undulator. One can clearly see the gain in terms
of flux and monochromaticity (in particular when comparing undulators to bending magnets).

net, a wriggler, and an undulator
The optics hutch contains the elements, which shape the beam: it usually contains several elements
such as:
→ a shutter, which controls the entrance of the beam in the hutch (this is a crucial element for
the safety of persons).
→ slits. They give its shape to the spot, by removing the non-focused part of the beam (especially
in the case of the bending magnets),
→ monochromator. It selects very precisely the energy (selects the good wavelengths from the
white beam),
→ focusing mirrors and/or lenses. They concentrate the beam to a spot, which can be as small
as a few microns or even less. Alternatively, they can be used to make a very wide and
homogeneous beam (ex. case of medical tomography).
The experimental hutch provides all the sample environment and detection systems needed to
carry out the experiments.
• The sample Environment is made of elements, which control the conditions of the experiment:
vacuum chambers and high pressure gaskets, sample heaters and cryogenic coolers, gas flows
and electrochemistry cells are some examples of systems mandatory to make several sorts of
experiments.
• The detector. The detector is in charge of collecting the information provided by the interaction
of the beam with the sample. It will be further detailed in the next section.

1.1.4 The place of the detector in the chain
The detector occupies a central place in the experimental setup, in this that it collects the photons
scattered after the beam/sample interaction. So the detector is a main source of information in any
photon science experiment.
So far, lots of efforts have been put in the production of high quality beams in terms of stability,
monochromaticity... The fantastic progress in this field is highlighted by the exponential rise of the
brilliance of the light sources during the last few decades (see Figure 1.2).
After those great achievements in brilliance, now comes the time to harvest this huge amount of
scattered photons with detectors. Indeed, in a lot of experiments, the main limiting factor is
the detector itself. The ESRF long-term strategy, which defines the future developments at ESRF,
states that ”detectors are generally recognized as the weak link in the modern use of SR”[1].
Detectors used in the experiments usually suffer from:
• Low efficiency (only a very small fraction of the monitored particle are actually detected, so the
radiation dose received by the sample has to be increased)
• limited speed (fast reactions cannot be recorded. This also increases the dose received by the
sample)
• limited size (lowers the speed of the experiments forcing to make several acquisition.)
• limited dynamic range (a problem for techniques giving a high contrast, like small angle diffusion
scattering analysis).
Now more emphasis is put on instrumentation in the beamlines. Most large facilities have specific
programs for the development of new generation detectors. To answer the high cost associated to
these developments, collaborations among several institutes are created.
Already, various development projects have started to provide the beamlines with detectors, which
would suit the current requirements of experiments carried out in modern lightsources.
10 Introduction
In particular, this thesis is part of a project to develop a new generation of gas-filled
detectors with a high dynamic, large area, good efficiency and good robustness.
This thesis explores the possibility to use a photocathode as a first step photons → electrons
converter to ensure a good efficiency and spatial resolution of the detector.
1.2 Detectors in the hard X-ray energy range
A short introduction to the most common technologies of detectors used in the synchrotron radiation
community can be found in the well-known orange X-ray data booklet [2]. For each technologies an
extensive description can be found in K.Knoll’s Radiation and Measurement [3].
It should be noted that in what follows only detectors technologies designed for X-rays are described.
Yet, most of those detectors can also be used with other sort of particles/radiations.
1.2.1 What are the detector main characteristics?
Basically, a detector provides information about the:
• position
• time
• eventually energy and direction
• intensity
of an incoming particle/photon beam.
The measurement of one physical quantity is never perfect, but suffers from several imprecision and
uncertainties. Those uncertainties have several origins:
• The measured signal itself suffers from statistical fluctuations. Those intrinsic fluctuations
cannot be avoided, but several measurements of the same quantity enable to determine the
distribution function of the physical quantity. Statistical models then enable to determine more
accurately the physical quantity, and also to calculate the statistical error of the measurement.
• In addition to the intrinsic fluctuations of the measured physical quantity, the detector suffers
from a limited precision in measuring it. The characteristics of one detector give information
on the accuracy of one measurement, and on the error of measurement.
• The signal is never recorded alone, but several fake events appear with the measurement and
tend to blur/hide the physical quantity measured. This contribution is often called background,
and finds its origin both in the detector imperfectness, and in the environment of the detector,
which can be source of such unwanted contributions to the signal.
The last two contributions (fluctuation and background) are usually referred to as Noise. The noise
can be analyzed in terms of power, spectrum, as well as uniformity. The quality of one measurement
is then evaluated thanks to the ( )
Power A 2
Signal to Noise ratio = signal = signal , (1.1)
Powernoise Anoise
1.2 Detectors in the hard X-ray energy range 11
where A is the RMS2 amplitude of the signal.
The detector characteristics give information about:
• The quality of the measurement performed by the detector. This comprises among other aspects:
the resolutions in energy and position, the contrast the detector offers, and the noise it adds to
the signal.
• The speed of the detector: the minimum amount of time between successive measurement (dead
time) and the maximum intensity it can measure.
• The geometrical information about the detector: mainly its active surface. Also the volume of
the detector can be of importance in crowded spaces.
1.2.2 The Detective Quantum Efficiency
Figure 1.13 : Illustration of the effect of the noise and contrast on the quality of one image.
The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) characterizes the measurement uncertainty introduced by a
detector.
It is now recognized as the best figure of merit of a detector. It provides extensive information about
the capabilities of a 1D or 2D detector to return images with sharp and noiseless images. So it
expresses the ability of one detector to sense a signal against a background of radiation, and without
deteriorating the intrinsic noise of the incident beam.
The Detective Quantum Efficiency (sometimes spelled Detection Quantum Efficiency), is defined as
SNR2
DQE = out2 , (1.2)SNRin
with SNRout and SNRin being the signal-to-noise ratios at input and output of the detector.
√
2root of mean square: the quadratic mean of the signal < x2 >.
12 Introduction
It differs from the quantum efficiency QE in the sense that it takes into account, not only the fraction
of the photons, which are actually recorded, but also all the system losses due to the limited resolution,
noise performance... of one real detector.
SNRin can be seen as the best achievable detector performance, and in this sense, 0 < DQE < 1.
The DQE is function of several parameters[4, 5, 6]:
• The Quantum Efficiency,
• The spatial frequency,
• The particle energy,
• The signal intensity.
It is often used as a Figure of Merit of the detector, but it strongly varies with the conditions of
acquisition of the data, and as the available data are often incomplete, its utility is still limited. A
lot of discussions are still ongoing to define standard conditions of measurement of the DQE of one
detector.
Yet some methods are now recognized as standard for the evaluation of detectors DQE. Practical
methods of evaluation of the DQE and associated parameters, and more globally of the performance
of one detector can be found in references [6, 7, 8].
In the following section, some of the most important characteristics of imaging detectors are shown,
through their impact on the DQE. Yet, the DQE is rarely fully measured and in most cases, only
those characteristics of the detectors, which have been measured.
1.2.2.1 The DQE dependence on the Quantum Efficiency.
The Quantum Efficiency QE, in its most fundamental definition is the fraction of the incident quanta,
which participate in the signal formation. So it is evident that the QE is a limiting factor to the DQE
of one detector.
SNR2Indeed, if we go back to the definition of the DQE = out2 (eq. 1.1), by writing SNR = Sx weSNRin
S √ S S √ σ S √

obtain out = DQE in and outσ σ S = DQE
out
σ . For σout > σin, and outS = QE the Quantumout in in in in
Efficiency, we have
DQE 6 QE. (1.3)
The quantum efficiency QE acts as an absolute limit to the detective quantum efficiency DQE of the
detector. In particular, a perfect detector (with no intrinsic noise: σout = σin, infinite resolution...)
have a DQE = QE. For a real system, the DQE is equal to the QE of a perfect detector, which
would give the same image statistics for the same input flux [7].
In conclusion, for an imaging detector, the DQE is best with:
• small detector noise σdno,
• high quantum efficiency QE,
• high input signal Si,
as expected.
1.2 Detectors in the hard X-ray energy range 13
1.2.2.2 The dependence of the DQE on the spatial resolution
Figure 1.14 : 0.1 mm thick engraved lead line pattern used to test the spatial resolution of detectors
The properties given in the previous section do not show the influence on the detection efficiency
of the spatial resolution of the detector. Indeed, it is well known that detectors have a ”limited
resolution”, meaning they cannot resolve objects smaller than a certain size. This characteristic of
the detector is also known as the Position Resolution.
Several mechanisms can decrease the spatial resolution of one detector
The Position Resolution of one detector
In a position sensitive detector, there is a shift between the incoming position and the detected one
of a particle. This is due to pixel size, as well as by charge spread and parallax errors. The spatial
resolution gives information on the accuracy of the position given by the detector.
It is best measured with the Modulation Transfer Function (M), which gives the system response to
a sine-wave spatial-frequency amplitude. In other words, the modulation transfer function gives the
spatial frequency response of an imaging system or a component.
the modulation, Mi, of the image divided by the modulation of the stimulus Mo
M at a certain spatial frequency ν is defined as the ratio of the modulation of the image at output
and input:
Modulation
( ) = outM ν
Modulationin
with Modulation = Imax−IminI +I , in analogy with Michelson’s definition of visibility of interferencemax min
fringes.
It enables to evaluate easily the response of a complex system as simple product of the individual
MTF’s of the components of the system. For example for a classical Fluorescent screen + Optic +
14 Introduction
CCD camera, the MTF would be given by:
M =MFluo.Screen ·MOptic ·MCCD.
The MTF allows to calculate the output signal, which is basically the input signal multiplied
by the MTF.
Contrast Transfer Function
In practice yet, it is much easier to measure the Contrast Transfer Function (C) defined as the square
wave spatial frequency response. It is related to M by:
pi C(3N) − C(5N) C(7N)M(N) = [C(N) + + − . . .] (1.4)
4 3 5 7
where N is the signal spatial modulation frequency in ’line pairs’ per unit distance.
In practice, one uses masks with several patterns of lines (see 1.14 of various spaces and thickness to
evaluate the detector response. The resolution is given by the smallest pattern distinguishable by the
detector.
Line spread function
NB. In the same way one can define the Point spread function.
This is the response of the system illuminated by a narrow slit (or small point). It is related to M by
the ’simple’ Four∑ier Transform:+
M(ν) = k=∞∑ −i2piν−∞ LSF (k∆x)e∞ 

k∆x)+ (1.5)
k=−∞ LSF (k∆x)
So the LSF basically gives the detector response as function of the spatial frequency of the image.
Here again it is easy to measure experimentally for it is enough to measure the response of a detector
to a mask.
In most cases, the LSF (or PSF) can be very well described by a Gaussian. It is then fully described
by the standard deviation σdet (considering that the gaussian is centered at the point/line entry).
σdet is often called (a bit abusively) position resolution.
One can also notice that from the PSF one can determine the output intensity:
Iout(x, y) = PSF (x, y) ∗ Iin(x, y) (1.6)
where ∗ is a convolution.
The dependence of the DQE on the MTF
The dependency of the output intensity from the spatial frequency (cf. the relation between the
MTF M and the contrast transfer function) is taken into account in the DQE. This corresponds to
a dependency of the DQE on the MTF, which fully describes the response of the detector as function
of the spatial frequency.
1.2 Detectors in the hard X-ray energy range 15
To take into account the impact of the noise in the frequency domain, one has to consider the power
spectrum of this noise, also named Wiener Spectrum3. This notion enables to write, in analogy with
the definition of the DQE, its dependence on the frequency:
The dependence of the SNRo from the MTF can be written as [9]:
2
So MTF 2
N2
DQE = o (1.7)
SNRi
with N2o being the noise power spectrum, and SNRi the signal to noise ratio at the input ; SNRi
corresponds to the inherent fluctuation of the signal at the input, and is often considered to follow a
poisson statistics (like was done in section 1.2.2.1). MTF as well as No are functions of the spatial
frequency.
Details on the dependence of the DQE from the MTF and noise are given in [10].
1.2.3 The mode of operation, speed and behavior of one detector at large inten-
sities
Integrating vs. Counting detectors
There are two modes of operation of detectors, which differ on two approaches to evaluate the intensity
of the measured signal:
• Counting detectors, which count the deposited quantas of energy one by one ;
• Integrating detectors, which accumulate the deposited energy before it is evaluated.
While counting detectors have been around for a while (for example, the Geiger Muller Counter),
most of the detectors used nowadays are based on the principle of integration of the signal.
In an integrating detector, the charge deposited by the particle(s) is accumulated (integrated) over a
period τ . The measurement of the intensity is obtained from the height of the signal obtained.
The maximum amount of energy the detector can accumulate before the signal is measured cor-
responds to the maximum intensity the detector can measure (saturation level). This maximum
intensity is often limited by physical processes in the detector.
The frequency at which the image is read gives the frame rate of the detector. In the case of area
detectors, the frame rate is typically of a few 10 of hertz / cm2.
In a counting detector, each electrical pulse (corresponding to each particle) will be counted if it
is above a predefined threshold. The intensity is given by the number of single events, which were
counted during the period τ .
The maximum intensity the detector can record is limited by the detector’s maximum count rate,
which is the maximum number of pulses, which can be recorded. Modern electronics allow count
rates as high as several megahertz.
3The power spectrum is the average power of the spectrum of the signal/noise in a unitary bandwidth centered at
the frequency f.
16 Introduction
Figure 1.15 :
Signal as analyzed by an integrating detector and a counting detector.
Counting detectors are considered as superior (especially for flat field detectors) because of their very
low noise (the threshold enables to discriminate real events from noise) and ability to count single
events. Theoretically those detectors are almost noiseless...
This is their higher cost (both for development and manufacturing) as well as the limitation of the
electronics, which have limited their use so far: counting detectors could not answer the needs in
terms of speed. Recently, the fantastic developments in terms of integration and speed of electronics
has made it possible to develop fast detectors with high dynamics and low noise. Now counting
detectors can compete in terms of speed (count rate) with integrating detectors.
In practice yet, counting detectors are not always better. So, as a compromise, some systems try to
adapt their modes of operation according to the incident flux, in order to offer the best efficiency
(DQE -detective quantum efficiency- see 1.2.2) [11].
Dynamic range
The dynamic range is the range of intensity the detector can measure: [min Nb Quanta;Max Nb Quanta].So
it is the signal to noise ratio, computed from the greatest signal acceptable by the detector:
Max Intensity
Dynamic = (1.8)
Noise
In the case of integrating detectors: the max intensity corresponds to the maximum signal measurable
1.2 Detectors in the hard X-ray energy range 17
in each picture, while Noise correspond to the detected intensity in the case of no intensity coming
on the detector.
In the case of counting detectors, the dynamic is the maximum count rate over the dark count rate,
which is the mean frequency of appearance of fake events (count rate recorded at zero intensity).
Associated to those definitions, there are a few notions of importance to evaluate the performances
of one detector:
Differential/Integral Non Linearity
The differential and integral non linearities (DNL and INL) measure the dependence of the detector
response as function of the signal intensity. The perfect detector has a constant DNL: ∂Response∂Intensity = Cte
(and a linear INL: Response ∝ Intensity).
Deviations are always present but can be corrected (eventually pixel by pixel in the case of position
sensitive detectors) afterwards.
The maximum intensity a detector can accept is limited by the so called dead time τ of this detector.
The dead time enables to measure the minimum time during, which a detector cannot record another
event. Theoretically, the maximum frequency of events the detector can accept is 1τ .
But there are two behaviors when successive events occur in a time inferior to τ (see Figure 1.16.
Dead Time Behavior
The dead time of one detector is the gap of time after one event was recorded when the detector
is unable to record another event. This minimum time between consecutive events can come from
limitations in the electronic of the detector, or from by physical processes in the detector itself.
For the income of photons on the detector is a random process, the probability that real events can
be lost is non zero. This limitation can be severe in the case of high flux, as a large number of events
are separated by a gap of time inferior to the dead time of the detector. There are two important
models for dead time behavior of the detector:
In the case of a non paralyzable behavior, the detector is able to count a new event immedi-
ately after the dead time of the first event is finished. In this case at high intensity, the detector
records events every τ , and a asymptotic saturation of the recorded signal occurs.
In the case of a paralyzable behavior, if two events occur successively in a time inferior to τ ,
then the dead time is prolonged of a value τ from the second event. In the case of high intensities,
the average time between events becomes shorter than τ , and no event can be recorded until
two successive events have a time separation superior to τ . The saturation appears then as a
decrease of the recorded signal.

1.3 Spectroscopy detectors
Spectroscopy detectors focus on high energy resolution. Most often they are position non sensitive
detectors, even if some of the technologies used for imaging detectors can offer energy resolution. For
the most important characteristics of spectroscopy detectors are their energy resolution and noise,
they often come with complex cooling system, which guaranties a minimum noise.
There are various types of technologies for spectroscopic detectors, corresponding to various energy
ranges. In X-ray photon science, the most typical detectors are based on technologies such a:
• Solid state detectors such as Silicon Drift Detectors, silicon crystals doped with lithium (Si(Li)
detectors) or high purity germanium (HPGe)
• Scintillation based detectors with various scintillation materials depending on the energy range.
Photodiode type detectors
In general, they consist of a p-n depleted region where electron-pairs are created by the incident
photons. Then a reverse electric field separates the charges, and a fast current pulse is recorded in
the built-in electronics. They offer a very high speed, and a good energy resolution (only 3.5 eV are
required for the creation of an electron pair in Si). Unfortunately, the small size of the depletion area
and the easy recombination of the charge pairs lower the quantum efficiency of the photodiode to a
very small value.
PIN photodiodes are an evolution of the photodiodes. They are based on the same principle, except
1.3 Spectroscopy detectors 19
that the depletion zone is made much larger with the use of an undoped layer between the N and P
zones. Still the lack of internal multiplication of the charges makes them unsuitable for low photon
flux experiments even if they offer a good quantum efficiency at low energies. Several suppliers of
PIN diodes are now available4.
Avalanche Photodiodes (APD) are other cousins of the photodiodes: they combine a thick (130 µm)
low field zone combined on both sides with a thin strong electric field p-n-junction. A precise control
of the doping levels makes it possible to have a rather large central depletion zone to ensure a good
quantum efficiency, and side electric fields strong enough to enable an internal multiplication of the
charges with gain up to 104. Arrays of APDs making relatively basic 2D detectors are now commer-
cially available (sizes up to 1 or 2 cm2) 5.
APDs find more and more domains of applications. Unfortunately they cannot be produced in large
areas (Si based technology).
Germanium detectors
Germanium detectors are based on the same principle
as photodiodes, except that they use germanium instead
of silicon as semiconductor. This enables the creation
of very large depletion zones (cm vs.mm) and so bet-
ters dramatically the efficiency for high energy particles.
Their higher intrinsic noise makes the use of liquid nitro-
gen cooling system almost mandatory6.
Si(Li) detectors
The introduction of lithium as a dopant is a way to
create an intrinsic like zone (donors and acceptors ex-
actly compensate) in the semiconductor. This enables
the creation of a much larger zone for pair creation,
such increasing the quantum efficiency for high energy
rays7.

20 Introduction
Scintillator detectors
Figure 1.18 : A Cyberstar scintillator based spectroscopy detector, and its electronics.
Scintillation materials convert high energy photons (or the energy deposited by other particles) into
visible, UV or infrared light. The intensity of the light produced is proportional to the energy
deposited over a wide range of energy (the usual unit is [photons/MeV]), thus enabling a simple
intensity measurement to determine the energy of the incoming photon. Yet this approach suffers
some limitations, which limit its use for spectroscopy applications:
• For the intensity is proportional to the deposited
energy, it is hard to use a scintillator in the case of
large numbers of incoming photons.
• Scintillators providing a good yield, also suffer
from a long response time, which is another limitation
to the dynamic range of those detectors.
Yet, photomultipliers tube, which provide an excellent efficiency to collect the weak light emitted
from scintillators, and convert it into an electrical signal, have made this approach a prime choice for
spectroscopy applications for a number of decades.
Conclusion
Current spectroscopic detectors mostly suit the current needs of the scientific community. New
developments now go in the direction of area detectors, and speed in order to enable new types of
experiments.
1.4 Imaging detectors 21
1.4 Imaging detectors
Imaging detectors include all line or area detectors. They are used both for imaging applications,
and to speed up the collection of data (with respect to a dimensionless detector, which would move
to cover the same area). This goes beyond a simple speed up of the whole experiment, for a lot of
samples, and in particular biological samples, suffer from long exposure into the beam. So imaging
detector can be an absolute necessity in certain fields in order to guaranty a good quality of data.
Imaging Detectors are the kind of detectors which need most of the developments in order to satisfy
the requirements of the experiments that scientists want to carry out nowadays.
1.4.1 current mature technologies
CCD based detectors
CCD detectors consist typically of a 2 dimensional arrays of silicon wells of a few 10’s of µm, which
store the charges created by light absorption. After this charge was accumulated, it is read out
sequentially with use of an integrated amplifier. They exhibit a very wide spectral sensitivity with
attractive quantum efficiency characteristics, but also present a large noise background. They are
typically used in photo-cameras, video-cameras, scanners, and other massively produced devices. As
such they are rather inexpensive, except in the case of very fast and large area components.
When used with hard X-rays, they are usually coupled with a fluorescent screen, which converts
X-rays into visible light. An optical system (based on common optics elements or on optical fibers)
is often used to reduce the fluorescent screen size to that of the actual CCD system.
CCD systems8 are nowadays one of the best way to achieve both large areas (eventually by coupling
several systems) with a high speed readout9. Unfortunately the optical system, and especially the
fluorescent screen largely degrade to resolution of those systems. In addition those systems present
an intrinsic high noise as compared to other technologies of detectors, which reduce their domains of
application.
Ongoing developments focus on new scintillator materials used to convert X-rays into visible light.
Thinner layers would increase the resolution especially with high energy photons, and faster scintil-
lators would enable higher frame rates. Also faster electronics are being developed, as it is also a
limitation to the frame rate of cameras.

Philips, GE Medical Systems, The FRELON system developed at ESRF[12]...
9Typical systems offer readout speed of a few seconds (up to 15), but new highspeed systems are able to have frame
rates as high as 20Hz.
22 Introduction
Figure 1.19 : A CCD camera from the MAR Com-
pany with its optical coupling system visible. Figure 1.20 : The image plate MAR 345 detector.
Image plates
Image plates10 (sometimes called memory phosphors, storage phosphors or photo stimulated phos-
phors) are based on thermoluminescent materials, also referred to as thermoluminescent dosimeters
(TLD). In this type of materials, the absorption of the incoming ionizing particle leads to the cre-
ation of electron-holes pairs, which are trapped in purposely introduced defects in the crystal. So
the material acts as an integrating detector, in which the number of ”stored” electrons and holes in
the defects of the crystal, reflect the intensity of the incoming beam. To obtain the image, energy
has to be provided so that electrons and holes can escape from the traps and recombine, giving a
luminescent signal. So classical systems consist of a laser scanning the plate after the acquisition, an
optics (usually an array of optic fibers), which collects the luminescent signal and a photomultiplier
or a avalanche photodiode to collect the signal.
Image plates are available in very large areas (the mar345 is as large as 300 mm in diameter), and offer
a large dynamics. Their drawbacks lie mainly in the presence of noise, and in their very limited speed
(the plate has to be scanned to readout the image and typically several minutes are needed per image).
Gas-filled detectors
Gas-filled detectors use a gas both for the absorption of the ionizing radiations, and for the ampli-
fication stage of the signal (electron multiplication). This is now a mature technology, which is still
interesting because of the major advantages it offers. Unfortunately, gas-filled detectors also suffer
from certain drawbacks, which prevent their generalized use nowadays.
A more extensive description of gas-filled detectors is given in the section 2, as well as the description
of this project, which aims in overpassing their limitations.

lography.
1.4 Imaging detectors 23
1.4.2 technologies under developments
1.4.2.1 Spectroscopy Detectors under development
Development focus on new technologies such as Silicon Drift Detectors in which the created charges
drift in a high resistivity, fully depleted silicon wafer. Electrons are collected on the edge of the
detector. Those detectors enable the measurement of simultaneous events occurring at different
places of the detectors, by being able to distinguish several rise times of the collected charge.
Already used techniques explained in the previous section are also under permanent development.
Also multielement detectors are being developed to offer higher count rates capabilities and larger
surfaces.
1.4.2.2 Imaging Detectors under development
CCD detectors and image plates are currently the most common imaging detectors. CCDs are used
when high speed is mandatory, while image plates offer large areas as well as a very good dynamic.
To answer the growing needs of the imaging community, strong progress have to be achieved in the
domains of dynamics, noise, and readout speed.
So the next step for imaging lies in the use of detectors operated in counting mode with a massively
parallel electronics (meaning each pixel is connected to a built in electronics where the first stage of
amplification and signal processing is performed, before the image is read out). This new approach is
possible thanks to the recent developments in the semiconductor industry, which offers components
small enough for this level of integration.
This approach will force the use of other technologies, for current CCD based systems as well as image
plates cannot be used in counting mode: the physical processes involved in the detection are too slow
to enable this approach (fluorescent materials as well as thermoluminescent materials have decay time
constants which are incompatible with single photon counting). So systems using a direct conversion
of the photon into the electric signal must be used (instead of a several steps conversion system like
in fluorescent+CCD or trapping+luminescence+photomultiplier). The 2 major possibilities are the
use of solid materials (Pixel and amorphous selenium detectors) or gas amplification based systems
(using the photoelectric effect to produce the initial charge).
24 Introduction
Pixel detectors
Figure 1.22 : A large area Gas Filled
Figure 1.21 : Schematic of pixel detectors. detector.
Photon-counting pixel detectors arrays are hybrid devices made of a semiconductor sensor connected
to a parallel CMOS readout circuit. The sensor is a Silicon (or another semiconductor) die with a
pixel electrode structure connected to the CMOS circuit by bump-bonding flip-chip technology (see
1.21). The sensor is fully depleted by applying a sufficient voltage bias. The photoelectric charge
created after X-ray absorption in the sensor is collected to the closest pixel of the CMOS circuit
along the bias field. Each pixel acts as an independent particle detector, including a complete pulse
processing chain as well as an event counter.
This kind of detectors currently achieves the best performance in terms of speed, and resolution.
Unfortunately, only small sizes can be manufactured yet11, and for large areas, arrays of detectors
have to be assembled. This results in inhomogeneities, which have to be compensated and dead zones.
The leading projects in this field are Pilatus (developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (SLS detector
Group) in Switzerland [13, 14] and the MaxiPix project developed by the Medipix consortium [15].
Here again, the integration of the readout electronics is a challenge!
Amorphous selenium/silicon detectors
Amorphous semiconductor detectors are based on the liquid crystal display technology. Essentially,
they are a matrix of capacitances charged (or discharged) by the current generated in the X-ray
irradiated amorphous semiconductor (often selenium). The charge is read by the TFT transistor
switches present at each pixel capacity. The main difficulty lies in the availability of a good quality
material, to permit the drift of the created charges to the transistors.
They are integrating detectors.
Gas-filled detectors
Very few technologies currently offer perspectives for large areas, especially in the case of fast detectors
(used in counting mode, with low noise...).

with gas detectors are given in the next section.

Chapter 2
The basics of gas-filled detectors
2.1 historical background
The history of gas-filled detectors starts around 100 years ago when Rutherford and Geiger (working
at the Manchester University) discovered electron multiplication gas-filled tube with a thin wire at
the axis position.
In 1928, Geiger and Mueller introduced the well known (and still used!) Geiger Tube, one of the
oldest type of ionizing particle detector. The Geiger Counter was the first electronic ionizing particle
detector.
Later, in the Manhattan Project [1], the gas-filled detector technology was largely improved. The
multiple wire proportional counter (MWPC) was invented. It was later implemented in high energy
physics by Georges Charpak, and revolutionized this field of physics.

Nowadays, gas-filled detectors are used in a large variety of research fields as well as for various
30 The basics of gas-filled detectors
industrial applications. They are routinely used for the detection of fast and heavy particles (high
energy physics), for the monitoring of nuclear facilities and other radioactive environment, for photon
detection and imaging (medical applications, non destructive analysis), etc...
2.2 Principle of gas-filled detectors
A detailed description of modern gas-filled detectors can be found in G. C. Smith’s article [2]. A
deeper analysis of the principles of gas filled detectors (with delay lines) is in A.-M. Petrascu’s article
[3]. Status of development of gas-filled detectors at the ESRF (giving more details on the specificity
of gas-filled detectors used in the synchrotron radiation world) is found in M.Kocsis article [4].
In a gas-filled filled detector, the gas is used for two purposes:
• First it absorbs a fraction of the energy of the incoming photon/ionizing particle. In result of
this interaction, one or several electron-ion pairs are created (ionization of one particle of the
gas).
• Secondly, an internal multiplication of the electrons. This internal multiplication (typically
a gain factor of 104 to 105) is sufficient to enable each photon to be directly and separately
counted by some electronics.
2.2.1 The X-ray absorption in the gas
Figure 2.3 : The cross sections of various interaction processes in the case of Lead.
In a gas-filled detector, the first function of the gas is to absorb part of energy of the incoming photon
to create an electron, as a base of the electric signal.
2.2 Principle of gas-filled detectors 31
In the case of the travel of one X-ray photon through matter, several of sorts of interactions can occur
between this photon, and the atoms (in our case those of the gas), but mainly three are of importance
for photon measurements (see Figure 2.3): the photoelectric absorption (τ in Figure 2.3), the compton
scattering (σincoh in Figure 2.3), and the pair production (κn and κe in Figure 2.3). The later one
can occur only in the case of highly energetic photons (more than 1.02 MeV = 2∗Masselectron, more
often called gamma rays), so it will not play any role in the case of low energy X-rays.
The two other govern the law of absorption of the photon in the gas. Their respective probability
is measured by their respective cross sections, which in general depends on the element, the density
and the energy of the photon.
The photoelectric effect is dominant for energies up to a few 100s of keV depending on the element
atomic number. Then Compton scattering becomes increasingly important, until it is dominated by
pair-creation.
Compton Scattering
The interaction process of Compton Scattering takes place between the incident X-ray, and an elec-
tron in the gas. It is an elastic scattering process. The photon is deflected through a certain angle
θ with respect to its original direction, while leaving part of its energy to the electron, then called
recoil electron. The energy deposited depends on the angle of deflection, and is increasing with θ.
Photoelectric absorption
The photoelectric process is the very process at the source of the electron production in the gas. When
a photon is absorbed by an atom following such a way, its energy is in fully transferred to an electron,
ejected by the atom from one of its bound shells. The result is the creation of an electron-ion pair,
with the electron energy being Ee− = hν − Eb, where Eb is the binding energy of the photoelectron
in the original shell.
In the case of X-rays, the most probable absorption occurs with electrons from the inner shells.
Shortly after the photoemission process, there is a rearrangement of the electrons inside the atom, or
the absorption of a free electron from the medium. Either one (or more) characteristic X-ray photons
may be emitted, or an Auger electron will be created to enable the excited ion to reach a more stable
state. In the case of an X-ray photon re-emission, this photon often is reabsorbed via photoelectric
effect, such creating another electron in pair, but with less energy.
2.2.2 The amplification and the modes of operation of gas-filled detectors
The internal amplification of the signal
After the first ionization of a gas particle occurred (by the incoming detected particle), the created
electron is thermalized and under moderate fields, the gained energy is lost in collisions with the
gas molecules. In the regions where the gained energy between two collisions is exceeding a certain
level (typically ∼ 35eV ), it becomes a ionizing particle, which will later ionize another gas particle,
creating a second electron, and finally leading to cascade of ionization (as secondary electrons are
32 The basics of gas-filled detectors
produced).
The amplification of the signal will then depend on several factors such as
• The type of gas,
• its density,
• the accelerating electric field and its shape.
This leads to various Modes of operation, which are classified for a certain gas, as function of the
applied electric field.
Modes of operation of gas-filled detectors
Depending on the applied accelerating potential, various modes of operations of gas amplification are
distinguished. The Figure 2.4 (extracted from [5]) gives the amplitude of the signal collected after the
absorption of a particle and the corresponding amplification modes. The two curves correspond to
two different amounts of energy deposited in the gas. The result with two X-rays of different energies
would be alike.
The different modes of operation of gas amplification are:
Recombination region When the electric field is very low, the field is insufficient to prevent re-
combination of the ions pairs. The current collected on the electrodes is very low, as only the
fraction of the created ions pairs, which did not recombine is collected.
Ion Saturation From a certain value of applied voltage, the electric field is strong enough to effec-
tively separate the charges created after absorption of the energy of the ionizing particle. Then
almost all pairs are collected and the intensity corresponds to the rate of creation of charges in
the volume of the detector.
Proportional region When the applied tension is further increased, the mean energy gained by
electrons between collisions is higher than the ionization energy. From this moment an ampli-
fication of the signal occurs. For a certain tension, the intensity collected is proportional to the
original number of ions pairs created. This is the region of true proportionality.
Limited proportional region and Geiger mode Higher electric field result in the apparition of
non linearities: when the electric field becomes very strong, the amount of charges present in the
gas becomes high enough to alter severally the electric field resulting from the applied tension.
Eventually, this Space Charge can become completely dominant and fully determine the pulse
shape. This last mode is the Geiger mode of operation of the detector.
In order to avoid a dependence of the amplification on the localization of the deposited charge in the
detector chamber, and to improve the stability of the system, the strong electric field is applied only
in a thin region of the chamber. In the rest of the chamber, where electrons are created, only a drift
field is applied. This also limits the spread of the electron cloud (going exponentially with distance),
which occurs during the multiplication and limits the loss of resolution while preserving an absorbing
area sufficiently large.
2.2 Principle of gas-filled detectors 33
Figure 2.4 : Regions of operation of gas-filled detectors for two deposited energies.
Usually the collection of the electrons is performed with a 2D array of wires, which enables propor-
tional amplification mode (the so called multiwire proportional counters introduced by Charpak and
coworkers in 1968 [6]).
Classical gas mixtures are composed of Xenon, Krypton, Argon, Methane, CF4 etc... (see [2]).
2.2.3 The benefits of gas-filled detectors
The main advantaged of gas-filled detectors as compared to the previously described types of detectors
are:
• their intrinsic speed mainly limited by the electronics
• their dynamic range, also limited by the memory depth
• their available size (among the largest detectors)
• their cost of development and manufacturing
• their easiness of operation, and robustness.
Gas detectors find domains of applications in most fields of photon science. They are some of the very
few types of detectors, which can be built in very large areas. In the high energy physics experiments,
it is common to find detectors of several square meters, and covering solid angles of almost 4pi.
2.2.4 The limitations of gas-filled detectors
Main limitation
As compared to other technologies of detectors, gas-filled detectors suffer mainly from one disad-
vantage, which made them almost abandoned in whole fields of photon science: They have an
34 The basics of gas-filled detectors
intrinsic low quantum efficiency, they leave a great number of incoming particles undetected
(said another way, they are photon hungry).
This is simply due to the very low density of gases, and so very low stopping power. To overcome
this, it is possible to increase the pressure of the gas, but this is at the expense of amplification
characteristics, which are best at low pressures...
They also suffer from sever parallax error leading to a loss of resolution as soon as the incoming
particles do not have a direction perpendicular to the detector (see Figure 2.5).
Figure 2.5 : Parallax error is the loss of resolution due to the absorption of non perpendicular photons all
along the depth of the ionizing chamber, thus broadening the position response of the detector.
So when considering their application in photon research, other technologies less photon hungry are
usually used, even if they offer poorer performances in most other characteristics.
other limitations Another weakness is linked to the use of wires to collect the charges after
multiplication (MWPC). The small radius of those wires makes them very sensitive to discharges in
the detectors (more likely with increasing acceleration voltages/gains). It is indeed very difficult to
repair broken wires in the detector. In addition the broken wires are likely to create short circuits
and create further damages).
Modern gas-filled detectors overpass this by using microstructures in place of the traditional wires.
2.3 Recent Evolutions of gas-filled detectors 35
2.3 Recent Evolutions of gas-filled detectors
There has been various recent evolutions of the classical gas-filled detectors to overcome their weak-
nesses and keep their advantages.
The main attempts of improvements of gas-filled detectors over the last few years have been stripped
detectors, as well as hybrid gaseous multipliers. Interesting Parallax Reduction Techniques were also
introduced.
Parallax reduction techniques
The simplest technique to reduce parallax errors, is to build a curved detector. This technique has
been successfully used at ESRF ([7]) and later at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ([8]). In
addition it largely suppresses the charge spread problem.
Figure 2.6 : Curved gas-filled detectors do not suffer from parallax errors.
Other methods of correction such as off line correction by determination of the X-ray absorption
depth were also demonstrated ([9]) but never used in the synchrotron world.
For area detectors, solutions to reduce parallax were offered very early after the idea of MWPC was
published. Charpak’s group at CERN proposed to add a spherical drift chamber to the front of the
MWPC [10]. This idea was successfully applied to a working device, which became the workhorse of
the synchrotron LURE in the 80’s ([11]). The idea was then bettered in the late 90’s [12].
Micro-Pattern
Strip detectors are an answer to the fragility of MWPC’s wires and limited amplifications character-
istics (limited by space between wires). They also permit to avoid the difficult manufacturing of the
chambers (to place the wires of the chamber).
A large number of structures have been proposed over the last 20 years such as micro-strip gas
36 The basics of gas-filled detectors
chambers [13], the microgap chamber [14], the compteur a` trous [15], the gas electron multiplier [16],
the micro-mesh gaseous structure [17], or the micro-pin array [12].
Figure 2.7 : GEMs are thin metal-clad polymer foils pierced by a high density of holes. On application of a
difference of potential, between the two electrodes (sides) electrons drift and multiply in the holes.
Among those detectors, GEMs (Gas Electron Multiplier) created the largest interest. Introduced
in 1996 by F. Sauli and his colleagues from CERN [16], GEM’s key feature is a three-layer (metal-
insulator-metal) grid which is used both for the amplification of the signal, and for ion feedbacks
prevention (to protect the photocathode, used to convert electrons). Several of such grids can be as-
sociated to increase the amplification of the system. Working devices were reported in various groups
in the world and developments are ongoing to improve this technology. GEMs foils are routinely pro-
duced at CERN, and are now commercially available thanks to the company Tech-Etch Inc.[18, 19].
Resolution and speed improvements
The limiting factor of spatial resolution of the detector is the photoelectron range.
The center of mass of the produced electrons during multiplication reflects the position of the original
ionization process, and so of the detected particle. Delay-line encoding or charge division methods
are naturally determining the center of gravity of the electron cloud below the anode spacing. The
speed of the above system is limited to Mega counts per seconds (Mcps) range. For example, the
RAPID (Refined ADC Per Input Detector) system [20] developed at the Daresbury synchrotron in
the UK, is able to determine the position of this center of mass by comparing the amount of charges
on the different anodes reached by the cloud of electrons. As a result, the detector is able to position
the original impact with a speed of 107 counts per second.
2.4 Gas amplification compared to Microchannel plates 37
2.4 Gas amplification compared to Microchannel plates
Microchannel plates (MCP) are devices able to amplify signal with a very large gain in vacuum.
Figure 2.8 : A two slab Micro Channel Plate (Chevron configuration)
They consist of a thick slab of highly resistive material (glass, silicates) riddled with small tubes
(diameter ∅ ∼ 10 µm, and interspace ↔∼ 15 µm) leading one face to the other: the microchannels.
The face of the tubes is covered by a continuous-dynode electron multiplier. The application of a
strong potential between each face (∼ 500 V ) enables the acceleration of electrons in the tubes, which
hit the surface of the tube, leading to an amplification of the signal as they create secondary electrons
at each impact.
Modern MCPs usually consist of several slabs of MCPs with an angle between the successive tubes
(chevron or V-like geometry). This geometry leads to a greater amplification for the same applied
voltage, and to an excellent compactness.
Unfortunately, MCPs suffer from major problems:
• Especially for single events, the gain of MCPs is very dispersed. If used in saturation mode, the
pulse height is stable and the time jitter small, but the pulse decay is long and not constant.
If used in linear mode and associated to a constant fraction discriminator, the pulse shape is
assumed to an impulse response with variable height, but fixed shape from a single particle.
• They suffer from a limited speed, meaning they cannot reach high count rates (∼ 150 kHz).
• They can amplify a fix charge during their lifetime, so they need to be replaced frequently.
• They are not available in very large surfaces (diameter area ∼ 10 cm).
38 The basics of gas-filled detectors
Compared to gas amplification system, they offer for the same stability in operation, a better gain
and a very good compactness. Unfortunately, this is a much slower system, which degrades over time
and is less easy to maintain. In addition they cannot be built in very large areas (several 10s of
centimeter).
Those reasons, especially their limited count rate capabilities make them a difficult choice for high
count rates detectors.
2.5 A promising approach to overcome Gas-filled detectors limita-
tions
A promising approach to overcome the parallax of gas filled detectors (see 2.2.4) is the use of a solid
converter called Photocathode. The solid state materials density is roughly 1000 times that of a gas.
As a result a few microns are enough to absorb the incoming photons and convert them in electric
signal. This presents several advantages, including the absence of parallax errors (see Figure 2.5), a
better efficiency, and a higher compactness of the detector.

Photocathode for gas-filled detectors
What is a photocathode?
A photocathode is a solid converter: it converts photons into electrons. The energy deposited by the
incident particle enables the creation of hot electrons (more energetic than free electrons), which exit
the photocathode at a position very close to the entry of the incoming particle.
Photocathodes have to suit the following requirements:
• Good conversion efficiency
• Chemical stability : as the photocathode has to operate in a gas, it must be reasonably chemically
stable
3.1 Basics of Photocathodes
There is currently no theory to describe precisely and predict numerically the characteristics of pho-
tocathodes. Only phenomenological models can be made to help predicting the characteristics of
materials as good photocathodes.
This comes from the extreme complexity of the physics of electron transport into matter, as the
cascade of events varies not only with the type of material (chemical nature and related physical
properties), but also with the microscopic structure of the material (most defects, grain boundaries,
or impurities act like traps for electrons).
42 Photocathode for gas-filled detectors
Figure 3.1 : After its creation, the hot electron rapidly looses
its energy because of several interactions with the lattice or other Figure 3.2 : The region of the photocath-
electrons. Few electrons actually reach the surface. ode contributing to yield. L is the scatter-
ing length, la is the absorption length.
As a result only the physics of the absorption of the incoming photon into the matter is well described.
To go further, one has to use approximate models, which cannot lead to numerical predictions of the
efficiency and speed of the photocathode.
The best (phenomenological) model to describe photocathodes is called the Spicer Three Step Model.
It was developed approximately forty years ago by William E. Spicer, when he was working for SLAC
(The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)[1].
This model basically separates the process in three major steps:
• Absorption
• Electron transport to the surface
• Extraction from the surface.
More precisely, the model consists in examining the contribution of a slab dx at a distance x from
the surface to the emitted electrons.
This contribution depends on:
 the amount of photons, which arrive at this depth.
 the probability of an electron photoemitted in this slab to join the surface,
The total yield of the photocathode is then obtained by integrating di(x) over the whole volume.
To help comparing materials, the model defines two lengths:
• la is the absorption length in witch most of the photons are absorbed. It is the 1/e length where
the intensity of the incident beam has dropped to 1/e.
3.1 Basics of Photocathodes 43
• L is the scattering length: the distance electrons can go over before they are thermalized.
The quality of a material can then be examined with the ratio laL , which should be as small as possible,
and ideally, inferior to unity.
The model also enables to define the active volume as the portion of the photocathode next to the
surface, which is at a distant inferior to both la and L (see Figure 3.2 in page 42). This is the region
of the photocathode, which is close enough to the surface to enable electrons to escape, and at the
same time in the region of absorption of the photons, so contributing to the yield.
Absorption
From the presented model, it is evident that a material with a high stopping power (small la) will
produce more electrons close to the surface, so more electrons with a high probability to escape the
material. In practice, these are materials with a high Z (superior to 50, or ideally to 70), which
present the best stopping powers.
Figure 3.3 : Electrons with energy EC < E < EC + EG have higher mean free path.
Electron Transport
The capacity of the Photocathode to transport hot electrons to the surface depends strongly on the
type and quality of the material it is made of. This is measured in the Spicer model by the value of
the ”scattering length” L. This value is closely related to the value of the mean free path and that of
the average loss of energy of electrons in the material.
To maximize the value of L, it is best to have a semiconductor. First because in metals, hot electrons
get thermalized very easily by the many free electrons. Secondly, in semiconductors, there is the
44 Photocathode for gas-filled detectors
appearance of the so called Magic window. The magic window is a region in the conduction band
(Ec < E < Ec + EG) where electrons have a much higher mean free path. Indeed, electrons having
such an energy cannot excite another electron in the conduction band, for this would result in two
electrons in the forbidden gap of energy. The electron ion pair creation being a dominant process at
those energies, this results in a much higher mean free path of electrons in the window.
It is also of strong importance to have defect free materials: each defect in the material (vacancy, dis-
location, grain boundaries...) acts like a trap for hot electrons, for they often result in dangling bonds.
To have further details, one can look at Henke’s papers [2, 3], in which a more precise model for
electron transport is given (especially concerning electron-electron and electron-plasmon interactions).
Those references also highlight how the efficiency of the photocathodes is closely related to the prod-
uct Eµ(E), where E is the energy of the incoming photons, and µ(E) the mass absorption coefficient
of the photocathode material.
Extraction
Electrons close to the surface do not necessarily go in the vacuum: they have to overcome a poten-
tial barrier called work function φm in metals or electronic affinity χsc in semiconductors (Figure 3.4).
Figure 3.4 : To exit the solid, e− have to overcome Figure 3.5 : The Band structure of a NEA semi-
the workfunction φm or electronic affinity χsc conductor close to the surface
This barrier is often several eV high, so very few electron can overpass it, leading to a poor yield.
To maximize the photocathode efficiency, one must select materials with a very low electronic affinity.
There are materials such as CsI, or hydrogenated diamond, which offer a Negative Electron Affinity
(NEA). Those materials are of course of special interest for they act like a kind of hot electron
fountain: hot electrons close to the surface see an attracting potential, which tends to eject them
from the material. The quantum efficiency of this sort of material is of course much better than that
3.2 Improved Models of Photocathodes 45
of classical materials.
Their main disadvantage comes from their very high chemical sensitivity. For the potential tends
also to attract anions, the negative affinity rapidly disappears as the surface gets polluted. So they
require special cleanness of the environment, which is hard to achieve when the photocathode is in a
gas chamber. It was also found that the coating of the surface with materials like caesium or TMAE
can improve this efficiency (see adding details in the following section, or see [4] published in 1936 !).
This effect is usually explained by the appearance of dipoles at the surface of the materials, which
lower the electronic affinity.
The Contradictions
Already several contradictory requirements appear for the photocathode :
• The photocathode must be thick to absorb the incoming particles, but thin to let electrons
escape.
• It should be made of high Z materials, but should be defect free. In terms of availability, there
are very few high Z materials (especially in the case of semiconductors), which can be processed
with a good purity and few defects.
• It would better be NEA but has to be chemically very stable.
So one has to choose the best compromise to finally achieve an optimal quantum efficiency in a certain
energy range.
3.2 Improved Models of Photocathodes
Obviously the model presented in the previous section is very simple, and it cannot be used for
quantitative analysis. It is yet the only general model.
Yet more accurate models were developed to predict quantitative secondary emission yield, as well
as the energy distribution of both photoemitted electrons, and secondary emitted electrons.
Unfortunately all those models are material specific (they usually study CsI, considered as the most
interesting material for photocathode application [5, 19, 7]), for they use extensively fitted parameters.
Most of them were developed for Monte Carlo based analysis. So it is difficult to use this sort of
models for prediction of efficiencies of new materials.
More details will be given in the section dedicated to the Monte Carlo Analysis.
3.3 Major technologies of photocathodes currently available
Most materials now used as photocathodes have been known for a long time. A compilation by
P. Mine´ then at Ecole Polytechnique in 1993 [8] is still valid (this publication deals with photoemissive
materials in the UV, but the state of knowledge in the X-ray energy range is not really different).
Jochen Teichert, Rong Xiang, Guy Suberlucq and Jeroen W.J Verschuur also made a Report on
46 Photocathode for gas-filled detectors
Photocathodes in 2004 but again, mainly focused on photocathodes in UV and Visible range for
electron injection system applications [9]. Focus was given on a better control of the fabrication
process to ensure the best quality of cathodes.
3.3.1 Metallic Photocathode
Metallic photocathodes are the oldest type of photocathodes.
Classical materials include gold, copper, and silver. Gold is of all those materials the best, for it offers
the best efficiency (highest atomic number so excellent stopping power), an excellent speed, as well
as the best chemical stability (noble metal) .
Gold is used for photocathodes in a wide range of application where high chemical stability, high
conductivity and speed are mandatory. This is especially the case for photo-injectors in synchrotrons
and X-fels (injectors made of photocathode excited with pulsed UV-laser to create the packets of
electrons) where high quality pulses of electrons (in terms of intensity and shortness) are mandatory.
The photocathode is often used in RF cavities coupled with the pulsed laser to enable the creation
of extra short/very high intensity electron packets.
NB. RF cavities cannot be used to improve the efficiency of gas-filled photodetectors, because they
work exclusively under ultra high vacuum (discharge problem) so are incompatible with gas amplifi-
cation.
Past studies of metallic photocathodes
Metallic photocathodes were mostly studied during the 70’s and early 80’s (though, some older
references can be found). Classical references include:
• for Gold, Copper and Silver: [10, 11, 3, 12, 13].
• for Aluminum and Al2O3: again [3, 13, 12].
• other materials such as Tungsten, Molybdenum, Silver, and Palladium are presented in
[10]
For the X-ray energy range as well as for the UV energy range, gold is the most suitable metallic
photocathode. Recent measurement using synchrotron radiation facilities [14, 15] report all with good
agreement efficiencies of a few tenths of a percents in the 1-10 keV energy range. [16, 17] also provide
interesting results even if the quantum efficiency is not directly measured. Lastly H.Henneken et al.
reported measurements of the efficiency of gold in the case of the specific Au(111) surface [15].
3.3.2 Semiconducting Photocathode
As previously discussed, semiconductors are theoretically much better materials in terms of quantum
efficiency. Their availability in excellent purities and almost defect free bulk materials make them a
very attractive choice.
In practice several compounds offer excellent efficiencies in the visible or infrared ranges (Alkali
antimonides such as Cs3Sb, K3Sb, Na2KSb, K2CsSb). Unfortunately they all present a high
3.3 Major technologies of photocathodes currently available 47
reactivity to moisture and oxygen, which makes their manipulation difficult, and also completely
unsuitable for gas amplification based systems.
Other systems were studied because of their insensitivity to visible photons, and high efficiency in
the UV range (solar blind photocathodes for spatial application). Those photocathodes reacting
to wavelength smaller than 380nm, often exhibit a negative electron affinity (eventually after an
activation with Cs or another material).
Theoretical analysis of secondary emission by semiconductors can be found in [3, 2].
Materials, which created interest include
• boron nitrides BN reported to present NEA characteristics [18]
• Gallium Arsenide GaAs also reported to present NEA when Cs activated (see [19], which
compares GaAs with other semiconductors, as well as [20, 21]
• Gallium nitride, Indium Gallium Nitrides and Aluminum Gallium Nitrides GaN,
INGaN and AlxGa1−xN were extensively studied because of their potential for solar blind
detectors ([22, 23, 24, 25]).
Unfortunately when it comes to X-rays, common semiconductors such as gallium arsenide, silicon or
germanium are completely inefficient. Indeed those materials do not have the stopping power suitable
for energetic photons, for electrons cannot reach the surface before they are thermalized. In addition,
those materials are available only in small dimensions.
Heavier materials being much harder to process in good quality, there are very few materials, which
are actually used as photocathodes. CsI is the exception, and it will be later described.
3.3.3 Organic Photocathode
Organic photocathode such as TMAE (tetrakis dimethyl-amino!ethylene), or C6H5, have created
great interest in the 80’s for they exhibit a negative electron affinity. They were also used as activator
(like Cs). Unfortunately, they are of no interest in the X-ray energy range, because of their very low
stopping power. The interested reader can find information in P. Mine´’s [8].
3.3.4 CsI
Since its first discovery by Taft and Philipp in 1957 [26] and its further studies by J. Edgecumbe
and E. L. Garwin in 1965 [27, 28], CsI has probably been the material, which was the most widely
studied. This comes from several advantages it offers:
• Excellent quantum efficiency: the material exhibit NEA properties, and an excellent stopping
power (high Z).
• A rather good chemical stability, at least if compared to most other materials with similar
characteristics. Still the material is hygroscopic and suffers from degradation with time.
• Easiness of synthesis and deposition.
48 Photocathode for gas-filled detectors
From the beginning, a lot of efforts were put in attempts to reduce its sensitivity to moisture and
need for cleanness (UHV conditions) [29, 8, 13, 32, 11, 34, 35]1.
Efficiencies measured vary among authors. This is probably due to the high reactivity of the material,
and the importance of the deposition/synthesis conditions.
• [32] report a quantum efficiency of 2 to 4% in the 5 to 10 keV energy range.
• [13] report a quantum efficiency of 1 to 5% in the same range of energies.
The ALICE collaboration made a systematic study of the effect of water and oxygen on the quantum
efficiency of CsI [36]. [32] provides information on the effect of heating to resorb the loss of efficiency
after exposure to moisture.
Effects of electric field [12], Gas amplification with various mixtures [38, 39], polarization of X-rays
[40], as well as various Monte Carlo dedicated codes [38, 5] were also studied. This shows the wide
interest and hopes that this material created.
Now, CsI is still considered as a reference, and a lot of projects are still based on the use of this
material. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of CsI as a photocathode is still an issue, and few success
were recorded.
Lastly, a sensitivity of CsI to radiation was recorded [8, 41]. This is of course an issue regarding the
stability in time of a detector using CsI. Fortunately, this sensitivity seems to be limited in the X-ray
energy range [41].
The key feature of CsI is its negative electron affinity. This NEA is explained by the appearance
of dipole charges at the surface of the material, leading to a bending of the band structure, and the
presence of an attractive potential to electrons at the surface.
Those dipoles are of course very attracting to all sorts of impurities, which easily form chemical
bounding with the surface charges, so destroying the NEA of the surface.
As a result, CsI photocathodes usually loose their high quantum efficiency after a few hours of
exposure to moisture, and even much faster in an unclean environment.
There were a lot of attempts to protect the CsI from degradation in unclean environment. Another
approach was to try developing online cleaning processes (like [32] already cited). But none of these
approaches were able to provide a solution acceptable in terms of robustness and efficiency.
It remains that CsI offers an attractive efficiency, and in addition it is widely available (it was also
successfully used as a scintillator material by addition of dopants like Tb or Na).
3.3.5 Conclusions on available technologies of Photocathodes and the issues re-
lated to their use
A wide variety of photocathodes is available on the market. But most of them are suitable only for
low energy applications (visible, ultra-violet and infrared applications).
There are mainly two families of photocathodes suitable for the hard X-ray energy range:
• Metallic photocathodes, mainly gold, which offers a poor efficiency but an excellent robustness
1It should be noted that a number of those publications come from A.Breskin’s group from the Weizmann Institute
of Science in Israel, which has been very active in developing this technology.

• CsI photocathodes, which offers the best efficiency, but a sensitivity to moisture and contami-
nation leading to huge technological problems, especially in the case of gas-filled detectors.
Recapitulation tabular (Table 3.1):
Other classical photocathodes such as tetraminoethylene (TMAE), the organometallics ((C2H5)Cr,
(C2H5)Fe...), are not suitable for X-rays for their stopping power is not good enough and so do not
achieve a good efficiency (this is mainly due to their low Z).
The same restrictions apply to GaAs and parents (InGaAs, InGaAsP) usually used after activation
with Cs. In addition, those materials can be used only with gases of very high purities.
TMAE was successfully used to increase to quantum efficiency of CsI and other photocathodes, but
no good stability could be achieved.

The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
This chapter presents the study by Monte Carlo of the photocathodes performed in this work.
The chapter is divided into four parts :
1. A general introduction to the Monte Carlo Method,
2. a description of the Monte Carlo code developed in this work is given,
3. a detailed analysis of the limits of Monte Carlo methods in the case of particle tracking into
matter is given, and the reason why these limitations forbid the use of this method in the case
of photocathode analysis
4. Conclusions on this part of the work.
4.1 A first approach to Monte Carlo
4.1.1 History
The Monte Carlo Method is called after the city of the Princi-
pality of Monaco, because of the roulette (and similar games),
seen as a random number generator. This name and the sys-
tematic development of the Monte Carlo Method date from
about 1944.
Before, there had been several isolated instances of this method,
some of them on much earlier occasions (see the examples given
in B.1). Those methods were only rarely actually used for sci-
Figure 4.1 : Monaco’s Casino entific purpose. A reason for this is the necessity to make a
large number of repetitive operations to achieve ”a good pre-
cision”. This is the arrival of computers, which created a greater interest for this sort of simulations.
56 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
The principles of the Monte Carlo Method are due to the polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam,
when he was working in Los Alamo for the Manhattan Project[1].
Those developments were implied by the work on the atomic bomb, which needed a direct simula-
tion of the probabilistic problems of neutron diffusion in fissile materials. But even at an early stage
of the project, Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann refined the method to a more general theory[2].
Finally, the systematic development of the method occurred only in 1948 with the work of Harris
and Herman Kahn. From this moment, the method had a fast development, and already in 1948,
Fermi, Metropolis, and Ulam obtained estimations for the eigenvalues of Schrodinger’s equation. The
Method became intensively used in extremely various fields from 1970, thanks to the new generation
of computers.
4.1.2 Description of the Monte Carlo Method
A possible definition: The Monte Carlo Method, as it is understood now, encompasses any tech-
nique of statistical sampling employed to approximate solutions to quantitative problems.
Said another way, the Monte Carlo Method gives an approximate solution to a problem using a sta-
tistical approach. The method consists in performing statistical sampling experiments, and applying
the central limit theorem1 to determine the general behavior of the studied system. It applies to
problems with no probabilistic content, as well as to those with inherent probabilistic structure.
The progress in terms of performance of modern computers has enabled the use of the Monte Carlo
Method in an increasing number of problems, and it has now several fields of applications: the most
common problem treated via a Monte Carlo approach are:
• Particle Transport through matter (detailed in 4.1.3),
• Astrophysics models,
• Molecular studies (”classical”, ”quantum”, ”path-integral”, ”volumetric”, molecular dynamic,
etc...),
• Evaluation of multi dimensional integrals (see example in annex B.1.1),
• solving the integro-differential equations defining the radiance field.
All those applications have lead to new development in various areas, for example the last application
has been used in global illumination computations, which is a way to produce photo-realistic images.
As a Result, Monte Carlo Methods have been usefully employed in industries as various as that of
Graphics industry (in the case of ray tracing softwares, see the case of the Radiance software [3]),
Finance [4], or Search And Rescue and Counter-Pollution, where models are used to predict the drift
of a life raft or of an oil slick on the sea.
1The Central Limit Theorem states that if the sum of independent random variables has a finite variance, then it
will be approximately normally distributed.
said another way: Given a population with a mean of µ and a deviation σ, then the sampling distribution of the mean
has a mean of µ and deviation of σ (N being the sample size).

4.1.3 The Monte Carlo Method in Particle Transport
There are mainly two different approaches to study the transport of particles through matter:
• The deterministic methods, in which the transport equation is solved.
• The Monte Carlo approach, in which single particle transports are computed.
It is said sometimes that, while the deterministic approach consists in solving the integral transport
equation, the Monte Carlo approach consists in solving the integro-differential transport equation.
This statement (which is incorrect, for the integral and integro-differential equations, are
actually a single one put in two different forms) illustrates the difference between the two approaches:
The deterministic methods return a general law of behavior of the particles, and a complete set of
information (flux, penetration, etc...).
In contrast, the Monte Carlo Method does not solve an explicit equation, but obtains the solution
by simulating individual particle transports and interactions with matter and by recording all the
information along the trajectories of the particle. Then the central limit theorem enables to determine
the general behavior of the particles by making a statistic analysis of the recorded information.
The particle transport simulation consists in tracking the particles one by one, by evaluating at each
step the probability of interaction with matter. The probability densities of interaction (calculated
according to various parameters such as the particles energy, type, bias... and the material type,
density...) are used in addition to a random number generator to determine the step length, and the
interaction type, which will happen. Thus, the particle behavior is not deterministic but governed by
probabilistic laws, following the quantum nature of fundamental interactions.
The interaction laws used in the simulation are obtained from the quantum mechanics theory (for
their analytical form), and from experimental measurements (the cross sections, which describe ”the
probability of interaction”).
The major problem of the Monte Carlo Methods for particle tracking is the need of computer power
to achieve simulations with an acceptable precision (i.e. enough particles tracked to achieve a good
statistics). Only modern powerful computers are able to perform the simulations in an acceptable
time (a few hours).
4.2 The Geant4 toolkit for particle transport into matter
The development of a Monte Carlo code is a very ambitious project, especially if it is meant to study
many materials. So it was preferred to use a general toolkit with proven capacities at low energies.
Several codes were considered (Penelope, MCNPX, EGSnrc, Geant4). Geant4 was chosen because
of various reasons, including:
• It has become a standard among Monte Carlo codes.
• It is well documented and open source, thus it gives straighter access to code and physics
verification.
58 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
• It is provided with numerous tools, which simplify data analysis.
• It has a series of libraries dedicated to low energies.
Among the disadvantages of Geant4 when compared to other codes:
• It is harder to program, as the user has to make the program himself (no script language to
command Geant4). It is written in C++. So the user needs basic notions of object-oriented
programming.
• Complex setup of the program (compilation, configuration settings...)
Those difficulties are also the strength of Geant4, for they find their origin in the very high versatility
of the toolkit, and in its cross-platform nature.
Geant -for GEometry ANd Tracking- is a simulation toolkit developed for the tracking of particles
through matter. It has been developed by more than 100 scientists from 10 institutions and has now
become a worldwide reference.
The first version was developed at CERN and dates from 1974. Up to version 3.21, Geant was made
in Fortran, and was mainly dedicated to high energy physics. From 1994, a new version completely
written in C++ and with modern object oriented structure was developed.
The toolkit includes facilities for handling complex geometries, tracking particles, simulating detector
response, handling run management and the user interface.
Its possibilities were also expanded, and Geant4 is now routinely used in fields as various as:
• High energy and nuclear physics,
• Medical applications,
• Space industry development,
• Accelerator physics,
• Lower energy physics ...
The reference article for Geant42 was published in Nuclear Instrument and Methods in Physics Re-
search A: [5].
4.2.1 The way Geant4 computes particle propagation
4.2.1.1 The tracking of the particles
The core of the method consists in tracking the particles one by one, letting them having all possible
physical interaction with matter3. It takes into account:
• the particle intrinsic properties, its direction, energy...
2The reference webpage of Geant is currently : http://cern.ch/geant4/
3Geant uses a combination of the composition and rejection Monte Carlo Method . The exact description of those
two methods will not be done here, but those who have interest can have a look at the book from H.Messel and al. [6],
at the article from J.C.Butcher and al. [7], and at the EGS4 Code System Manual [8].
4.2 The Geant4 toolkit for particle transport into matter 59
• all physical processes applicable to the current particle (ex. for a photon the photoelectric
effect, for an electron the bremsstrahlung ...).
• the volume boundaries, the material characteristics (geometrical information),
• the electromagnetic fields.
One usually makes the difference between the primary particles, which are generated by the program-
mer with defined type, momentum, position, etc... and the secondary particles, which are generated
by previous interactions of other particles with the matter or their disintegration (unstable particles).
Of course the secondaries can generate other secondaries. In Geant4 any created particle is tracked
until it has a zero energy (absorption).
In Geant4, the basic element of the tracking is the Step. It consists of two points (start and end
point) and the ”delta” information of the particle:
• step length,
• energy loss during step,
• change in elapsed time,
• change of direction, etc.
A step can be summarized the following way (see table 4.2):
→ The particle velocity is calculated,
→ A step length is associated to each physical process:
The probability of interaction weighed by a random number is computed, and converted into
a distance.
The minimum of all computed distances (ie. the limiting physical process) defines the physical
step length.
→ The navigator finds ”safety”: the distance to nearest boundary in the direction of the particle.
→ the minimum of physical step length and safety is kept as the step length
→ If the physics process has limited the step, the interaction is done (interaction before the
boundary of the volume). Otherwise the particle is transported to the next volume.
→ If the particle was not killed during the track, it is ready for the next step. Eventually,
secondary particles are stored for later tracking.
Before the following step is performed, Along step physical processes are applied (for example
scattering).
→ Last, the track properties are updated (momentum, position, time, etc...).
60 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
Figure 4.2 : Tracking procedure of particles in Geant4
At the end of the tracking process of one particle, one can eventually store the trajectory, which is
the compilation of steps, which happened when tracking the particle.
To have a better description of the tracking processes4, the interested reader should refer to chapter
5.1 of the Geant4 Users Guide [9]. Alternatively, the reference publication of Geant4 published by
the Geant4 community in Nuclear Instrument and Methods in Physics Research A: [5] gives a rapid
overview of the way particles are tracked.
4Especially to have a proper description of the way discreet and continuous processes are taken into account, and
the way boundaries are treated.
4.2 The Geant4 toolkit for particle transport into matter 61
4.2.1.2 The physical interactions in Geant4
The sets of physical processes
Geant4 offers two sets of processes describing particle interactions with matter:
• The historical one, dedicated to the high energy physics.
• The low energy extension of electromagnetic process, which has been developed since 1997,
intends to extend the validity of Geant4 down to low energy. It can now simulate physical
process down to 250 eV (and up to 100 GeV) with atomic numbers between 1 and 99.
This extension is described both in the User Guide [9] and in the Physics Reference Manual
[10] 5
In addition, Geant4 also enables the user to use the set of processes from the Penelope Monte Carlo
toolkit [11]. This way the users are offered two flavors of Low Energy physical processes, and rapid
comparison can be obtained.
Cross Sections
The physical processes involved in particle transport through matter have a quantum nature, meaning
that they do not follow a deterministic behavior.
On the other hand, their behavior is very well described by a probabilistic approach: the probability
of interaction of a particle with a material is fixed. It is measured by the cross section σ and expressed
in unit of area (usually in barn ≡ 10−28 m2). The cross section can be understood as the apparent
surface as seen from an incoming particle of an atom. In the case of a thin foil, the probability of
interaction of the incoming particle is n σ/S with S the surface of the foil and n the number of atoms
contained in the foil.
In practice σ varies greatly with the nature of the particle, and its energy.
The various sorts of interactions of the particle with matter have corresponding cross sections.
The differential cross section dσdΩ describes the probability to observe a scattered particle per unit of
solid angle Ω.
Cross sections used in Geant4 result from measurements as often as possible. When those data are
unavailable, then only an analytic formula is used to build the cross section data. For the data are
provided as series of discrete values, an interpolation formula is used to have access to any value of
the energy:

The set of data used in Geant4 for the determination of the cross sections and for sampling of the
final states are extracted from a set of publicly distributed evaluated data libraries (for the low energy
extension):

• EPDL97 (Evaluated Photon Data Library) : [12]
• EEDL (Evaluated Electron Data Libraries) : [13]
• EADL (Evaluated Atomic Data Libraries) : [14]
• stopping power data : [15, 16, 17, 18]
Those sets of data are well described in their reference manual which can be obtained from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory’s website6.
4.2.1.3 Analysis and Representation tools
The Geant4 toolkit offers numerous interfaces to access all physical parameters while the simulation
is running. It has also dedicated libraries for trajectories and other data storing. So the user can
record the information it has interest for later analysis.
But Geant4 is also AIDA compliant, meaning it has access to all the functionalities AIDA offers for
online data analysis and histogramming/tuppleing.
AIDA is a set of abstract interfaces and formats for data representation. There are various imple-
mentations of AIDA, offering all sorts of tools for data analysis (filtering, combination, etc...), and
representation (histograms, ntupples/data trees...).
For Geant4 possesses a direct interface with AIDA compliant tools, it is possible to make the analysis
of the simulations performed online and to store the results of those simulations. This is of particular
importance, as Monte Carlo simulations produce enormous amounts of data, which can be very long
to analyze.
Of course the data recorded can be further studied and exported thanks to dedicated softwares, which
are also AIDA compliant.
In addition, Geant4 possesses interfaces for 3D representation of the geometry and particles trajec-
tories in the volume. This is of strong help for complex geometries definitions.
4.2.2 The simulation tool developed
4.2.2.1 Description and Functionalities
The code developed was expected to
• help understanding the physics of the photocathodes in the X-ray energy range,
• compare various geometries of photocathodes,
• help predicting the efficiencies of unstudied materials.
For the description of the physical processes is rather straightforward in the Geant4 toolkit, the
hardest part was the implementation of the tools to perform detailed analysis of the simulations.
The following libraries of Geant4 or common associated tools were chosen for the implementation:

4.2 The Geant4 toolkit for particle transport into matter 63
Concerning the Physics
The Low Energy Extension was used to perform all the simulations.
All processes involving photons were activated except the pair creation, which has no sense for sim-
ulations of photons having energies lower than 100 keV.
So the following processes were activated:
• The Photoelectric effect (G4LowEnergyPhotoElectric library).
Both Fluorescence and Auger de-excitations of photoionized atoms were activated.
By default, the photoemitted electron has the same direction as the incident photon. Instead,
the use of the standard electron angular emission generator was forced. Unfortunately, this an-
gular distribution corresponds only to electrons emitted from the K-shell. For most interactions
of X-rays in the targeted energy range occur with electrons from the K-shell, this limitation is
not a real problem.
• The Compton Scattering process (G4LowEnergyCompton Library).
• The Rayleigh Scattering process (G4LowEnergyRayleigh).
Concerning electrons, all the processes were also activated:
• Electron Ionization (Library G4LowEnergyIonisation).
Here again Auger and Fluorescence desexcitations of the ionized atom were activated.
• The Bremsstrahlung continuous loss of energy of electrons (Library G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung).
• Electron scattering, which corrects path lengths and lateral displacements after each step for
charged particles (Library G4MultipleScattering). Identically Auger as well as Fluorescent
desexcitations were activated, for accurate simulations.
Cut Lengths (corresponding in Geant4 to energies under which no secondary particles are created),
were always set to their minimum values (≡ 250 eV).
Concerning the data analysis tools
Nb emitted e−To calculate the overall efficiency of the photocathode (calculated as Queff = Nb incoming photons), a
direct implementation was used. A csv (comma separated value file format) file was happened after
each simulations with Quantum Efficiency, and the photocathode parameters (Material, geometrical
information...).
All other information extracted from the simulations were recorded thanks to the AIDA interface.
A global Tupple Manager was created and linked to the various manager of the code (RunManager,
EventActionManager...), in order to enable information to be grabbed in the proper instances of the
code7.
More than 20 histograms, 2D clouds... were created to enable a proper track of the simulations.
7For example, Information regarding physical processes in the StepManager,
Information regarding the deposition of the photons/electrons in the EventActionManager...
64 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
4.2.2.2 The test of the code, comparison with experimental values
Various tests were made to confront the code with experimental data. Unfortunately, it turned out
that the code is not able to simulate properly the photocathodes.
In this part, success and failures of the code are exposed, and an explanation is given to those limi-
tations.
The aim of the simulations
Various authors were able historically to create codes based on the Monte Carlo Method calculating
successfully the efficiencies of photocathodes (especially for CsI, [19, 20] already cited in section 3.2).
So it was natural to try to develop a code based on the latest technologies to help studying new
materials for photocathode applications.
The code was expected to provide reasonable predictions of the efficiency of one material, the influence
of the geometry, and the influence of an electric field.
It was planed to use it to study novel sorts of photocathodes, with materials and geometries untested
so far.
In none of those expectations, an exact value was considered as mandatory, but an error of less
than 10 % can be considered as a minimum requirement to be able to use the code for predictions
on the efficiency of new materials.
Unfortunately, it turned out rapidly that this precision could not be reached with the code developed:
the calculated values were always largely underestimated and with an error for some materials of more
than one order of magnitude !
It is likely that this error can be bettered by a refinement of the code for each material studied. But
this process is long and uncertain, and it involves several experimental tests to adjust the physical
model used for each material.
This study was out of purpose in the scope of this work, which aims in testing several materials.
Examples of results returned by the code and discussion
Gold and CsI were taken as reference materials to test the code. As both materials were intensively
studied, it was easy to find reliable measurements of their absolute efficiencies.
For Gold, the measurements made by B. L. Henke et al. at the BESSY-I and II light sources [21]
were taken as a reference (Figure 4.4, and for CsI, the measurement by G.W.Fraser were taken (Figure
4.3).
In the simulation, the photocathode thickness is 1 µm, and the efficiency is calculated from the
electrons escaping the photocathode on the side of the incident photons (following the corresponding
measurements in the cited publications).

66 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
4.2.2.3 The limits of the Monte Carlo Method
A deep investigation of the code and of the Monte Carlo Method was performed to understand why
the simulations were providing such bad results.
First the Geant4 toolkit was compared with another well known code: Penelope, developed mainly
at the University of Barcelona (PENetration and Energy Loss Of Electrons and Positrons in matter,
[22, 23]). This toolkit did not give better results. The same toolkit was also tested through its
implementation into Geant4.
After some investigation it became clear that several problems could explain why the code would
return wrong results:
• A problem of Approach: The Monte Carlo Method is based on a particle/nucleus interaction
approach. The models do not include a priori, differences between the various chemical states
and physical structures, which coexist in one material (chemical bounding, crystalline structure,
grain joins, etc...). Yet those states can have a large impact on the dynamic of electrons in the
material, for any defect in the crystallinity of the material corresponds to a trap. In particular,
a semiconductors and metals are treated mainly the same way.
In the case of X-rays and energetic electrons, this approximation can be considered as not too
rough for at high energies, most interactions occur with electrons of the core shells of the atoms.
Those inner shells being practically unperturbed, the corresponding cross sections do not vary
sensibly.
But when it comes to lower energy electrons, most interactions occur with the outer shell
electrons or with free electrons, so the result becomes largely affected by the precise form of
the material (chemical state, bounding to neighboring atoms, etc...), as well by its purity and
its structure (change of band structure, traps, etc...). This is the main limiting factor for
simulations at low energies[24] .
Unfortunately, concerning photocathodes, the key phenomenons occur at this energy, for most escap-
ing electrons have an energy of only a few eV.
In addition, a number of other difficulties appear at small energy:
• The quality of experimental data at low energies. Experimental cross sections at low
energies are extremely hard to obtain with a good precision. Actually, only some indirect data
can be used, like the stopping power for electrons through a thin slab, characteristic energy losses
(plasmon excitations), and the total mean free path for inelastic scattering.
On the other hand it is not possible to theoretically determine the values of the cross sections,
as this implies solving the many-body interaction problem in solids.
In practice, while cross sections are provided down to very low energies, their precision is
considered as extremely poor.
• The infrared divergence. As explained previously, at low energies, particles tend to create
large numbers of secondaries, which in turn create an even greater number of daughter particles.
4.3 The simulation performed 67
To avoid this, the Monte Carlo codes block the creation of secondary particles under a certain
cut off energy. This is extremely bad for the simulation of photocathodes, as it turns out that
secondary electrons are the main contributors to the total yield (from 80 % for materials like
gold to more than 99.5 % in the case of CsI[21]).
• The specific problem of electron extraction from the material. As emphasized by the
Spicer model, the extraction of the hot electrons from the surface is a key problem, for the
electrons have to overpass a barrier of potential to reach vacuum. Those potentials are of the
order of a few eV high, so they are far too small to be properly simulated by Monte Carlo codes.
Moreover, according to B.L.Henke et al.[21], most secondary electrons have an energy inferior
to 10 eV . The interested reader can also read the publication by A.Gibrekhterman et al., which
details the proportions of primary to secondary electrons contributing to the emitted current
in [19] in the case of CsI. Also B.L.Henke et al.[25] detail how the conditions of cleanness of the
surface can have a major impact on the emission efficiency.
So the major difficulties arise from the strong dependence of the photocathode quantum efficiency on
physical effects, which occur at energies unreachable by conventional general purpose Monte Carlo
codes.
The few codes, which succeeded to overcome this difficulty are based on analytical formula with free
parameters such as the probability of loss of an energy ~ω per unit energy, momentum, and path.
This method enables to obtain codes in very good agreement with experimental data, but they are
material specific and cannot be extended to other materials in general (see the very interesting work
by T. Boutboul et al.[20] in the specific case of CsI).
In conclusion, if the transport of the X-rays is well simulated by the Monte Carlo codes, the simulation
of the very low electron dynamics in solid state materials is far from being enough refined to enable
a proper simulation of the photocathodes.
4.3 The simulation performed
Despite of the bad performance of the code to reproduce quantitatively the efficiency of the pho-
tocathodes, simulations were performed to study the possibility of a qualitative description of the
enhancement of the efficiency by varying the geometrical structure of the photocathode.
The result of those simulations is presented in this section.
4.3.1 The simulations performed
The simulation of flat photocathodes was performed to check the validity of the code. The results were
presented in the section 4.2.2.2. They serve as the basis to compare with the efficiency of structured
photocathodes.
Different types of structures were simulated:
• Structures with ”pillars”
68 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
• Structures with ”pyramids”
• Chevron like structures
• Structures randomly or periodically placed...
Those studies enabled to optimize the thickness of the photocathodes as function of the energy of
the incoming photons. Indeed, the most energetic electrons are those, which exit the photocathode
from the deepest places, and they are also those which are correctly simulated by the code, for their
energy is high.
For example Figure 4.5 shows the position of photoemission of the electrons, which reached the vac-
uum in the simulation for two different energies. It clearly appears that, from the point of view of the
escape length of the electrons, a photocathode of thickness 0.5 µm is too thick for low energies (here
10 keV) but well adapted for higher energies (50 keV). Both the pillar structures and the underlying
layer are made of the photoemissive material (gold).
Figure 4.6 shows the simulation of a pyramidal structure with only the outer layer being photoemis-
sive. This corresponds to the case of structures, which are covered with the photoemissive material
(gold). The underlying structure would be made of a low absorbing material (like capton), which is
not simulated.

picture is a photocathode of thickness 0.1 µm and height 3 µm. The bottom picture is a photocathode with the
same parameters except the thickness: 2.5 µm.
4.3.2 Use of the simulations for thickness optimization
The simulations performed enabled to confirm that the electrons photoemitted have a very short mean
free path in the photocathode. No quantitative differences in terms of efficiency could be extracted
for the different thickness. Only a qualitative analysis thanks to diagrams like on figures 4.5 or 4.6
4.4 Conclusion on this part of the work 71
enabled to define optimized thickness.
According to this analysis, for energies in the order of a few keV (as the main target of energy range
in this application), thickness of the order of a fraction of a micron seem to be the most suitable, for
all tested material. Larger thickness indeed result in dead zone in the middle of the photocathode,
and imply larger structures, which corresponds to a smaller surface of the photocathode, and so to a
lower efficiency.
This result was predictable from the known mean free paths of electrons in photoemissive materials.
4.3.3 Simulation of the impact of structures on the photocathode
Even if the code cannot simulate properly the quantum efficiencies of photocathodes for X-ray de-
tectors, it is a priori not out of hope that it can help to evaluate the effect of structures on the
photocathodes.
To test the validity of the code for this, after the first experimental test of structures had been done,
the simulations were compared to the experimental results.
The measurements to perform this verification are detailed in section 7.1.2. The sample Trizact 143
is constituted of periodic square pyramids of sizes 500 µm length and height ∼ 160 µm (see Figure
7.4 and 7.5). The faces form an angular of 57oC with respect to the base plane. The sample was
covered with a gold layer of thickness 0.3 µm.
The measurement indicate an increase of quantum efficiency of a factor ∼ 1.9 in good agreement with
the theoretical value of 1cos(57) = 1.9 (see section 6.2.1).
The simulation by Monte Carlo of the flat surface calculated a quantum efficiency of 0.088 % (cf
Figure 4.4) for an energy of 5 keV.
With the geometry of the trizact sample, the code returns a quantum efficiency of 0.12 %. This
corresponds to a gain of a factor: ∼ 1.4.
So here again, the code fails to predict correctly the increase of quantum efficiency due to the struc-
tures on the surface.
4.4 Conclusion on this part of the work
Use of the code for photocathode simulations
Unfortunately, the application developed cannot be used to predict theoretically the quantum effi-
ciencies of novel photocathodes.
The limits of the Monte Carlo Method for Photocathodes Simulations.
The impossibility to simulate properly the photocathodes properties, lies in the poor simulation of
the particles interactions with matter. This is due to the incomplete cross section knowledge
for very low energy particle-matter interaction.
72 The Simulations by Monte Carlo Method
More precisely, in the case of the photocathode simulations, the electrons behavior could not be
simulated with a sufficient precision (while the simulation of the photons interaction were precise
enough).
So, in order to use a monte carlo approach to simulate X-ray photocathodes, one must first determine
precisely cross sections at energies down to a few eV.
To obtain those cross sections at such energies, it is not possible to study each material and combine
the obtained cross sections to simulate mixtures of them like it is usually done at high energy for
such an approach cannot take into account the chemical state of the atoms.
So each material has to be studied one by one.
Is is possible to use Monte Carlo codes for photocathode simulations ?
It is possible to overcome the lack of knowledge of the cross sections at low energies by introducing
free parameters, which are then fitted on experimental data. This approach was successfully used to
study CsI [20] and enabled a much better understanding of the material.
Of course this sort of method is material specific and cannot be used for general purpose photocath-
odes simulations (to study a great number of photocathode material).
This sort of analysis being out of the scope of this thesis work, the code was not further used, except
for trivial thickness optimization analysis.
It should also be noted that the developped application would likely have been more successful in
simulating the photocathode properties used with more energetic photons.
As with increasing photon energies, the fraction of energetic electrons contributing to the yield in-
creases [21], the code is more capable of simulating the photocathodes properties.
The lack of experimental data at higher energies did not permit to test further the code, and here
again it was not in the scope of this thesis work to investigate further the limits of the code.
So it is not hopeless to use a Monte Carlo code to simulate the efficiency of photocathodes in the
case of photocathodes used with more energetic photons.
In particular, Geant4 offers all the needed flexibility to implement cross sections with better precision,
and to adapt the Monte Carlo method to the specific case of very low energies particles.
The only limitation would be the power of the computer, as the number of secondary particles would
increase dramatically (infrared divergence).
Possible other methods for the simulations of photocathode simulations
with low energy photons.
Other methods to simulate photocathodes properties are analytical methods like the three step model
introduced by Spicer (see section 3.1) or more simply an evaluation of the efficiency by considering
the product Eµ(E) (with E the energy, and µ the photoionization cross sections).
Those methods do not provide quantitative evaluations of photocathodes quantum efficiencies Yet.
4.4 Conclusion on this part of the work 73
It remains that this part of the work was of great help to understand the various processes and
parameters, which are key for the quantum efficiency of photocathodes in the hard X-ray energy
range. This has proven to be of great help for the following research of new materials for photocathode
applications.

Experimental Setup and Sample Preparation
5.1 Design of the measurement setup
5.1.1 A few general considerations
The measurement of the quantum efficiency of a photocathode is not a trivial task. The actual effi-
ciency varies greatly with the experimental conditions, and with the material quality and the shape
of the photocathode material.
The main factor is the cleanness of the photocathode surface, as it has a strong impact on the work
function of the material, which is the main parameter determining the quantum efficiency.
To reach the maximum quantum efficiency of one material, one has to deposit it in an ultra clean
environment (ultra-high vacuum), and to perform the measurement in situ without any vacuum break.
Yet, in this work a perfect environment was not targeted as this does not enable to test the photo-
cathode in real conditions (gas-filled detectors). Indeed maintenance operations often require to open
the detector.
The preparation and mounting conditions of the samples are those typical for the preparation of
gas-filled detectors (clean room environment, special care in cleaning...).
The main requirements for the photocathode quantum efficiency measurement setup are:
• Adaptability to all available sources (synchrotron, but also X-ray tube and radioactive sources).
This implies the ability to work with very small X-rays flux.
• The possibility to work with samples of various sizes and shapes.
This requires a system to keep a constant distance between the photocathode and the polarizing
grid.
• The possibility to use the system both in reflection and transmission modes (electrons collected
on the side of incident X-rays or on the opposite side).

Table 5.1 : X-ray tube source parameters
The main difficulty arises from the necessity to work with very low currents. Indeed, a 55Fe ra-
dioactive source of activity 30µCi, encapsulated in the protection case typically offers a flux of
∼ 106 photons/s/4pi (an avalanche photodiode measurement gives 4 ·106counts/s). If the photocath-
ode has a quantum efficiency of 1% at the k line of 55α Mn (5.9keV), then the expected current is of
106 ∗ 0.01 ∗ 1.6 ∗ 10−19 ≡ 10−15A ≡ 1 fA.
So the setup must be able to measure currents of less than a femtoamper.
The source used to perform the measurement was mainly an X-ray tube, mounted with a copper
anode. Apart from measurements made for calibration purposes, the tube was used with the param-
eters indicated in table 5.1.
The setup was also tested on the ID15c ESRF synchrotron radiation beamline, which has a fixed
energy of 39.5keV. For the signal to noise ratio was not actually better than the one obtained with
the X-ray tube (flux ∼ 1010 photons/s, but in the meantime much lower quantum efficiencies of the
photocathodes), the beamline was not often used.
5.1.2 The chamber and the ammeter
5.1.2.1 The Photocathode holder, the electrical shielding
The electrical scheme used to perform the measurements is given in figure 5.1.
It was chosen to bias the photocathode at a negative potential and to place the collection grid at
ground potential, rather than polarizing the collection grid. This presents several advantages:
• a smaller sensitivity to the geometrical parameters,
• no contribution to the measured current of electrons photoemitted by surrounding materials at
ground potential,
• a better use of the ammeter, which has a dedicated mode for such mounting (see later for a
description of the ammeter).
Indeed, some earlier tests with the grid being polarized showed higher leakage currents (typically
several fA), any other parameters being identical.
5.1 Design of the measurement setup 79
Figure 5.1 : Schematics of the experimental setup used to make the measurements
The holder is mainly made of PEEK, a UHV compatible, hard plastic. It also shows a high electrical
resistivity (around 1014 Ωm at room temperature). To reduce as much as possible the surface con-
ductivity, a cleaning with ethanol (and eventually acetone to remove traces of glue due to the copper
tape -see next) was systematically performed.
Figure 5.2 : The photocathode peek support
The circuit is fully shielded with guard rings. A copper tape was used to adapt the shielding to each
photocathode. Special care was taken to hide the copper from the X-Rays (to avoid contribution
from the copper).
80 Experimental Setup and Sample Preparation
The grid used to polarize the photocathode (actually it is at ground potential) is mounted on a copper
holder, with an iron ring to put it under voltage.
After mounting and cleaning of the photocathode, the resistance between the photocathode and the
other parts of the circuit (guard-rings and collecting grid) was typically of a few 100s G Ω to a few
T Ω (as measured by the Keithley 6430, see later). When applying a voltage of −100 V , typical
measured leakage currents were inferior to 0.4 fA.
5.1.2.2 The Chamber
Figure 5.3 : The chamber with some of the connectors
The chamber has a volume of 2.5 dm3. It is made of standard and custom components. It has various
coaxial and triaxial connectors, as well as a KF-connector for pumping. The entrance window is a
thin Beryllium window of 2 ∗ 1 cm2 size.
Connections with the ammeter are performed with triaxial feedthrough connectors (by Pomona)1.
1For the connectors to the ammeter are 3 slot-male triaxial connectors, while the Pomona feedthrough are 2 slot-male
triaxial male connectors, 2 to 3 slot-female triaxial connectors made by Trompeter.
5.1 Design of the measurement setup 81
The preamplifier of the ammeter (see later) was directly connected to the chamber (via the adaptors)
without any adding extra wire.
The chamber was pumped thanks to a turbo-molecular pump. Yet no precaution was taken to reach
ultra high vacuum. Only high vacuum was used to perform the measurements (to suppress any
contribution of gas molecules to the measured quantum efficiency). This is justified by the need to
develop photocathodes for gas-filled detectors, which have to work effectively in unclean environments.
5.1.2.3 The Keithley 6430 ammeter
The Keithley 6430 sub-femto ammeter is a high
end electrometer by Keithley, whose main charac-
teristic is the presence of a remote pre-amplifier
with triaxial connectors, which reduces as much as
possible the contribution of the leading cable to the
measured signal.
The 6430 possess several ways of operation, includ-
ing the possibility to measure very small currents
while polarizing the sensor to a voltage in a range
−210 V < U < 210 V (Source-Measure Concept).
This mode was used to polarize the photocathode
according to the schematic on figure 5.1. This
Figure 5.4 : The Keithley 6430 ammeter
mode is also the one providing the best internal
precision of measurement [1, 2].
The 6430 can also be used to measure electrical resistances up to 20T Ω (the measurement is performed
between the guard and the source). This mode was used to check the quality of the insulation
(∼ cleanness) of the setup before each measurement.
5.1.3 Results of calibration and test of the chamber
To ensure that the setup provides reliable measurements of the photocathode quantum efficiency, a
tests were performed with the X-ray tube (all tests performed with a copper cathode, acceleration
parameters being 20 mA current, and 20 kV accelerating voltage).
First the setup was tested without any photocathode. This enabled to measure the contribution
of the grid (parasitic photoemission). For this, the schematics presented on figure 5.1 had to be
inverted, so that the ammeter would actually measure the current emitted from the grid (as a negative
contribution to the measures intensity). This intensity I0 was I0 < 2 pA. This contribution is superior
to the typical leaking currents, but can be considered as negligible when compared to typical measured
photo-currents (typical measured currents are of the order of 20pA to several hundred pA, see 7.1.2).
In addition, this measurement corresponds to the absence of any electric field (no photocathode). In
presence of electric field, the amount of grid photo-emitted electrons is reduced to its most energetic
fraction. Other electron cannot escape the attracting potential.
82 Experimental Setup and Sample Preparation
Figure 5.5 : Current-Voltage (I-U) characteristics of the experimental setup in presence of X-rays with a
gold photocathode.
With the same configuration (ammeter connected to the grid), tests were performed with a ”non
emitting photocathode”: a thick kapton foil with copper on the back layer to bias it. This was used
to measure an hypothetical contribution of the surrounding materials (from the PEEK made holder).
Again this contribution was extremely small, for no current could be recorded (contribution inferior
to the intrinsic noise of the system ∼ 0.1 fA).
This measurement also confirms according the previous measurement (no bias, ammeter connected
to the grid) that the contribution of the grid is very small.
Last a reference system (gold deposited on a kapton foil by sputtering) was used to study the de-
pendence of the electrons collection quantum efficiency on the bias voltage. The result is depicted in
figure 5.5.
A current saturation clearly appears for voltages inferior to −40 V . The non zero intensity for posi-
tive bias can be explained by the proportion of photoemitted electrons with high kinetic energy (see
[3]). Electrons emitted with energies superior to 100 eV (theoretically up to 20 keV for the tube was
used with an acceleration of 20 kV ) have a sufficient energy to escape the attractive potential of the
photocathode and so are counted. The small current value at positive voltages highlights the small
proportion of photoemitted energetic photons.
Photoemitted currents as function of the electron intensity on the cathode also follows a very good
5.1 Design of the measurement setup 83
linearity with the X-ray tube current in the range [10 mA; 40 mA]: the photoemission is proportional
to the flux of X-rays. This indicates that there is no saturation effect at those intensities (like charging
of the surrounding material, which would affect the extraction electric field).
5.1.4 Conclusion concerning the setup
The test of the setup was a success: the setup shows very good characteristics for the measurement
of very low currents. Its intrinsic noise is inferior to the fA, and can measure the typical currents
emitted by the photocathodes (pA ← nA). The Keithley ammeter guaranties 512 digits at those
currents.
Its high modularity enables the test of photocathode samples of very diverse sizes and characteris-
tics. The setup can be used with various sources of X-rays: radioactive sources, X-ray tubes, and
synchrotron beamlines.

The different concepts to make a photocathode
Different approaches were taken to try to increase the photocathode quantum efficiencies. Some ideas
were explored only theoretically, while others -more promising- lead to the fabrication of test-samples
to compare them with reference photocathodes.
6.1 Indirect conversion
Figure 6.1 : A two step photons to electron conversion
In this section, an indirect conversion of the X-rays into electrons is evaluated. The X-rays are first
converted into lower energy photons thanks to a scintillating material, and then the photocathode
converts those photons into electrons.
The origin of this idea is the availability of photocathodes offering good quantum efficiencies in the
visible or UV energy range (infra-red sensitive photocathodes were not considered as they involve
88 The different concepts to make a photocathode
cooling systems to suppress their intrinsic noise -due to thermal emission), while one can benefit from
the yield of scintillators (several UV/visible photons created per incoming X-ray). In addition with
this technique one can hope to convert 100 % of the X-rays into visible/UV photons, and so avoiding
the presence of X-ray photons in the back-end electronic, which can be problematic (for the noise of
the system mainly).
If a fluorescent material can produce low energy photons with yields as high as 50, 000 photons/MeV ,
if about one hundredth of those photons hit the photocathode (the solid angle corresponding to angle
without total reflections is small), and if this photocathode has a quantum efficiency of 10 %, then
for 10 keV incoming photons, the expected yield is:
∗ ∗ 150, 000 0.01 ∗ 1 ∼ 0.5 e−/photon.
100 10
This is of course only a theoretical value.
Several aspects have to be considered when making such a system, including the predictable time
response, which has to be compatible with high count rates and the resolution of the system, which
must be compatible with the targeted pixel size.
Some prototypes (like [1, 2, 3]) exploiting such an approach were already made for PET application
(so with much higher photon energies), but none of them could provide good results until now. This
study explore the principle in the case of lower energy X-rays.
6.1.1 Photocathodes in visible and UV
The requirement for the photocathode to work in the visible range are the same as for those working
in the X-ray energy range. Yet, because of the difference of energy, one does not have to limit
the research to high Z materials, so providing a much wider range of possibilities. This is very
interesting as in general there are more materials with well controlled physical and chemical properties.
Lastly, photocathodes working at low energies find a lot of applications in astronomy, photo-injectors
(coupled with short-pulse lasers). At those energies they are typically found in photomultipliers and
phototubes.
The most common photocathodes in the visible/UV energy range (available industrially) are:
Bialkali photocathodes such as Sb−Rb−Cs, Sb−K −Cs. They feature a spectral responses in
the optical and close UV. They are usually not very stable, and so their use cannot be envisaged.
Multialkali photocathodes especially Na − K − Sb − Cs, which exhibit a very wide spectral
response, from ultraviolet to wavelength as long as 930 nm.
GaAs also with a very wide spectral response. Eventually GaAs photocathodes are covered with Cs
to make them NEA (negative electron affinity), but this is at the cost of a higher sensibility to
pollution.
Solar Blind Photocathode especially GaN , KBr, CsBr, InGaN and AlxGa1−xN . Most were
developed for space applications (UV cameras, insensible to light pollution due to the sun).
Those photocathodes often exhibit quantum efficiencies of more than 30 %, at wavelength
inferior to 350 nm. Among those photocathodes, GaN is the material which offers the most
promising characteristics.
6.1 Indirect conversion 89
Diamond (C*) is a relatively new photocathode, which offers several advantages: it is rather stable
[4] and NEA[5, 6] when plasma-hydrogenated. In addition in principle it suffers less than
other materials from pollution due to organic gases such as methane (which is a good gas for
amplification). Diamond photocathodes are obtained by CVD1, or by low energy ion deposition
of carbon. They are amorphous materials, which exhibit a mixture of sp2 (graphite like) and
sp3 (diamond like) bonds (CVD deposited diamonds are usually better as they exhibit a higher
proportion of diamond like bonds, and a better crystallinity). The surfaces are then treated by
plasma hydrogenation in order to make the surface NEA. The problem comes from its sensitivity
limited to wavelength inferior to 210 nm (large band gap semiconductor: 5.47 eV ).
6.1.2 Scintillation materials
There are various materials able to provide fluorescence photons at various energies. They are char-
acterized by four main parameters:
• The fluorescence yield, usually given in photons / MeV. The linearity of the yield is excellent
for energies up to a few MeV.
• The energie(s) of emitted photons.
• The time response of the scintillator, often there is a fast response corresponding to few photons
and a slower one corresponding to a much higher yield, and to an energy slightly different.
• The achievable resolution with the scintillator. This is strongly related to the thickness of the
deposited layer. But in average, with a resolution of a few µm, most materials can absorb 100 %
of the photons with wavelengths inferior to 30 keV .
To obtain a competitive quantum efficiency, as shown in the calculus made in the introduction, a
minimum yield of 10, 000 photons/MeV is necessary.
As said previously, it would be best to have a photocathode sensible to UV light. So the fluorescent
material needs to have a good yield at those wavelength (typically less than 350 nm).
Also, the aim of the project is to build a detector able to work in counting mode, and with a typical
count rate of the order of 1 MHz. This means the decay time constant of the fluorescence must be
at least one order of magnitude smaller, so of the order of 100 ns.
Here is a list of the most commonly used scintillation materials with high yields, small decay times,
and maximum of emission at energies inferior to 500 nm [7]:
NaI(T l) is one of the most common scintillators. PureNaI offers a maximum yield of 76, 000 photons/MeV
at λmax = 303 nm, and with a scintillation decay time constant of 60 ns. It is more often used
doped with thallium, and then has the following parameters: λmax = 415 nm, with yield
38, 000 photons/Mev and a decay time constant of 230 ns.
BaF2 is interesting because it emits very energetic photons: the fast component, which is 25 % of
the total yield is at 220 nm with a yield of 2500 photons/MeV and a decay time constant of
0.6 ns. The main maximum is at 310 nm with a decay time constant of 630 ns.
1CVD stands for Chemical Vapor Deposition
90 The different concepts to make a photocathode
CsI(Na) has a maximum emission at 420 nm, with a total yield of 38, 000 photons/MeV and a
decay time constant of 630 ns.
CaF2(Eu) has its maximum at 435 nm, a yield of 19, 000 photons/MeV , and a decay time constant
of 630 ns.
K2LaCl5(Ce) has its maximum at 380 nm, with a yield of 30, 000 photons/MeV , and a decay time
constant of 80 ns.
LaCl3(Ce) has its maximums at 330 − 352 nm with a yield of 49, 000, with several components,
which have all a decay time constant inferior to 200 ns.
LaBr3(Ce) has its maximums at 358− 387 nm, a total yield of 61, 000 photons/MeV , and 90 % of
the emission occurring before 90 ns.
Lu2Si2O7(Ce) (LPS) has a total yield of 23, 000 photons/MeV , with maximums of emission at
380− 385 nm, and a decay time constant of 38 ns.
LuI3(Ce) has a maximum emission at 465 nm, with a yield of 33, 000 photons/MeV , and a decay
time constant of 34 ns.
RbGd2Br7(Ce) has a maximum of emission at 420 nm, with a yield of 56, 000 Photons/MeV , and
a decay time constant of 43 ns.
BrilLancer 350 and 380 of formula LaCl3(10%) and LaBr3(5%) by the Company St Gobain are
also very interesting: BrilLancer350 for example offers a maximum of emission at 350 nm,
with a yield of 49, 000 photons/MeV , and a decay time constant of 28 ns.
In conclusion, there are a lot of materials providing maximums of emissions in the close ultra-violet
energy range, with acceptable decay time constants, and good yields. Unfortunately, all high yield
materials are limited to wavelengths superior to 300 nm, which is a problem as shown next.
6.1.3 Possible combinations
To obtain a good quantum efficiency, it is of course mandatory that the maximum of emission (and
more generally, the whole spectrum of emission) of the scintillation material be contained in the
spectrum of sensitivity of the photocathode.
For the same reasons as previously exposed, it is also necessary that the photocathode exhibits a good
robustness to pollution and to irradiation damages. The robustness to pollution of the scintillator
is less important, as it can be well protected if enough care is taken by the photocathode and the
substrate.
This leaves few choices of photocathode.
Diamond
In spite of its very interesting characteristics of quantum efficiency, diamond cannot be chosen, for
its sensitivity starts at energies unreachable by scintillation processes. In addition, diamond is not
yet well known as a material, and only a few groups can produce diamond with a sufficient quality
(in terms of crystallinity, hydrogen activation quality, purity of the material). Yet diamond is now
6.1 Indirect conversion 91
a subject of great interest for applications in the field of photocathodes (solar blind, for space ap-
plications), so it might become an interesting alternative in the future, also if suitable scintillation
materials are discovered in the future.
Bialkali and Multialkali
Bialkali and Multialkali are very interesting because they offer a good sensitivity at the emission peaks
of high yield scintillators. Unfortunately they are also extremely sensitive to pollution and moisture,
and even protective layers do not prevent loss of yield after short exposure to polluting environments
[8].
GaN and relatives
Those photocathodes have been the subject of a lot of studies for they offer a very good quantum
efficiency below the long-wavelength cut off (typically Q.E. ∼ 0.4) while having a very low quantum
efficiency above this cut-off. This is of special interest for solar-blind detectors in space applications.
In our case this means that they could be coupled to high-yield scintillators to form a two step X-ray
photocathode. In particular an association of a NaI scintillator and GaN photocathode seems to be
a promising combination.
Alas, those photocathodes also require a good vacuum to work effectively. So for the same reasons
as previously, they cannot be used in detectors using gas amplification.
Protected photocathodes
Studies have been made to try protecting UV and visible photocathodes for the specific case of gas-
filled detectors [8]. The possibility exists to effectively reduce the sensitivity of the photocathodes to
moisture and oxygen (the main contributors to the degradation of the photocathodes in unclean envi-
ronments), but at the cost of a highly-reduced quantum efficiency (at maximum 10 %, the protection
depending on the thickness of the protecting layer).
6.1.4 Conclusion
It appears clearly that in spite of its promises it will be difficult to build a 2 steps photocathode for
X-ray detection.
Diamond seems to be the most promising material, for it is a robust material (yet no real studies of
the stability of the hydrogenated surface -by plasma activation or else- could be found), but short
wavelength scintillators have still to be found. Otherwise carbon does not offer the stopping power
mandatory to enable a good quantum efficiency with X-rays without a first conversion stage.
The other materials unfortunately do not offer a stability good enough to guaranty a good reliability
when used in gas-filled detectors.
92 The different concepts to make a photocathode
6.2 Direct conversion
As an indirect conversion does not seem to be a good way of designing a photocathode for gas-filled
detectors, a direct conversion has to be used.
There are various possibilities to better the quantum efficiency of the photocathodes presented in
section 3.3. Three approaches were studied theoretically and experimentally in the scope of this work
to try bettering the quantum efficiency of photocathodes in the X-ray energy range:
• Modify the geometry of the photocathode in order to maximize the yield of a material,
• Use of sharp tips to profit from a field emission phenomena,
• Investigate new materials in order to find one with better properties.
All three approaches are detailed in the following subsections:
6.2.1 Modify the geometry to increase the yield of one material
As explained in section 3.1, the yield of the photocathode depends directly on the ratio laL , where la
is the absorption length and L is the scattering length.
Figure 6.2 : The impact of the incidence angle of photons on the active area (contributing to the yield).
This formula is valid in the case of photons with a direction perpendicular to the surface. Indeed
in the case of photons with slanted directions, the apparent thickness is increased, leading to more
photons absorbed in the active area (distance to the surface inferior to L). With the definition of the
angle α of Figure 6.2, the theoretical increase of quantum efficiency is a factor 1cos(α) :
∝ laEfficiency · 1 . (6.1)
L cos(α)
This was measured by D.P.Lowney et al. in [9] in the case of CsI, and the measurements show a
good agreement with the formula.
6.2 Direct conversion 93
To use this effect, the classical way is the use of a grazing incidence. Unfortunately, this leads also
to technological problems, and to the impossibility of making large areas detectors. So in this work
the possibility to use microstructures was investigated.
More generally this approach consists in increasing the surface to volume ratio of the material, as
this increases the active area. In fact the best available photocathodes have a controlled microstruc-
ture, which maximizes this surface to volume ratio (often a columnar structure obtained during the
deposition of the material).
The main requirement for the microstructures concerns their size: they should be much smaller than
the pixel size (collecting anodes in the case of a gas amplification), which means structures with
typical sizes of less than a micron.
Various ways of playing with the geometry were tested during this study, as will be shown in the
coming subsections. Only systems which can be obtained on large surfaces for a reasonable price were
used during this study.
6.2.1.1 Porous Photocathodes
The most straightforward way of creating a structure is the use of a porous material. Indeed this
enables the creation of a much larger surface (so a greater active area) actually reached by the photons
(then the absorption length becomes la , where Porosity is the fraction VporesPorosity V in the material).total
But as explained in the previous section, with increasing porosity, the probability that emitted elec-
trons reach the actual surface of the photocathode also decreases for the electrons have to find their
way through the connected pores or even through thin walls between pores to then exit the pho-
tocathode. While M.P Lorikyan [10] published interesting results using this sort of materials, the
measurements could not be later confirmed, and doubts subsist concerning a possible amplification
inside the pores, which would affect the measurement of the quantum efficiency (as several electrons
would be detected per single detected photon).
Still a similar approach was used for some of the samples prepared, and results are given in the next
chapter.
6.2.1.2 Regular Structures
Modern photocathode always have a microstructure, which maximizes the surface to volume ratio,
in order to have a maximum active area. Yet the structure is not fully controlled as it is most often
obtained by carefully controlling the deposition parameters so that the photocathode material adopts
a columnar growth [11]. So there is little control on the actual structure of the deposited material.
Another approach can be the use of a patterned substrate or a process able to imprint the desired
structure in the material. So that the geometry of the deposited material is well controlled and opti-
mized.
The main problem of structured photocathodes lies in the lack of escape path for electrons reaching
vacuum (or the gas) at a point far from the surface of the photocathode. The solid angle is indeed
94 The different concepts to make a photocathode
inversely proportional to the square of the aspect ratio of the structure2
Figure 6.3 : Two examples of regular Structures.
There are some requirements to respect to guarantee a minimum quantum efficiency of the photo-
cathode:
• For the photocathode has to work in transmission, special care must be taken to guaranty an
excellent transparency to X-rays of the substrate. Ideally the substrate is thin, made of low Z
material, and flexible in order to guarantee a good mechanical robustness. Organic materials
like kapton or some sorts of polymers are good candidates.
• The process used to create the structures must be adaptable to large surfaces at an acceptable
price. In particular, etching technologies or holographic-based technologies, which are common
in the semiconductor industry should be avoided, for their costs increase dramatically with large
surfaces. On the other hand, physical engraving technologies are well adapted (see the example
of the Trizact Sample in the next Chapter).
• The uniformity of the pattern has to be good enough to guaranty a good homogeneity of the
conversion efficiency.
As said before, typical sizes of the structures must be small enough to ensure that they will have no
impact on the uniformity of the image.
In addition, in theory it would be best to match the typical escape length3 of the emitter material.
Indeed smaller sizes will not enable to minimize the transparency and larger sizes will result in a loss
of flux in the active area of the photocathode.
But in practice the typical values of L are very hard to obtain (for example L(Gold) ≈ 2 nm and
L(CsI) ≈ 50 nm), and as the photocathode works in transmission, it is better to deposit a thin
layer of the high yield material (thus high stopping power) on top of a low stopping power structured
material, so that a maximum flux of photons reaches the active area of the material.
Concerning the shape, a trade-off must be done between two different requirements:
2For example, in the case of a square well of surface l2 and deepness h, the solid angle from the bottom of the well
l2is 2 ∝ 1 2 ).4pih (Aspect Ratio)
3the escape length is inferior to the scattering length because of the work-function/electron affinity of the material.
6.2 Direct conversion 95
1. The higher the aspect ratio, and the higher the angle with the surface of the structure, the
larger the active area,
2. The smaller and the more separated the structures are, the higher the electron escape solid
angle is, and so the higher the escape probability.
It is also better to have non rectangular like shapes, as the active area is very thin. Pyramidal, or
conic like shapes, offer a larger surface of the photocathode with an oblique surface with respect to
the X-rays.
Those shapes also enable a better penetration of the electric field between the structures, and offer
a larger solid angle for electrons allowing exit from the bulk of the material far from the top of the
structures. Indeed, the surface of the material often exhibits an attractive potential to electrons in
the gas (except in the case of NEA materials), so electrons are likely to return back in the material
again before reaching the surface of the photocathode.
To increase the escape probability of the electrons, one has to use an electric field. Unfortunately,
also the efficiency of the electric field is limited: Figure 6.4 depicts the result of the simulations of
the electric field in the case of metallic structures with rectangular and triangular shape by means
of a Finite Element Method (the simulations were performed with Comsol Multiphysics). The back
surface (flat) of the structure was at ground potential, while a ”collecting plane” above the structures
was at a potential of 100 V .
It appears in the simulation, that the electric field penetrates more into the triangular structures. In
both cases yet, the values reached are very small. Fortunately, most electrons exit the bulk material
with energies of only a few eV , so even a small electric field can have a strong impact on the collection
of the electrons.
In conclusion, the simulations show that the aspect ratio (HeightWidth ) of the structures cannot be very
high, otherwise the electrons created far from the surface will be not extracted.

6.2 Direct conversion 97
6.2.2 Field emission
Figure 6.5 : Simulation of the electric field in the case of silicon sharp tips.
As explained in section 3.1, the most important parameter for photocathode quantum efficiencies con-
cerns the electrons extraction of the material. Several studies [12, 13, 9] were performed to evaluate
the effect of an electric field to diminish the potential barrier electrons have to overpass to reach vac-
uum (the electron affinity/work function). Those studies showed that strong electric field is needed to
have a real impact on the quantum efficiency of the photocathodes. This can be explained by the much
higher value of the dielectric permittivity in solid materials (ex. ε(CsI) = 6.3 and ε(Si) = 12) than
in gas/vacuum (ε(vac.) = 1): in the case of two dielectrics superposed, the proportion of the energy
stored in both materials is the inverse of the ratio of the electric permittivities. As a result the electric
field has a very small value inside the material, and does not effect much the dynamics of the electrons
in the material (see the simulations by finite elements of metal microstructures on Figure 6.4). To
create a strong field inside the material, one has to connect electrodes to the photocathode, which is
of course not possible in the case of electro-emitters (the electrode would take the role of the emitter).
In order to improve the electric field, it was envisaged to use sharp tips to profit from the concentration
of the electric field around sharp tips (Tip effect), and so create a field emission system.
Figure 6.5 depicts the result of the simulation by the finite element method of such sharp silicon tips.
98 The different concepts to make a photocathode
Indeed, a strong electric field appears at the top of the tips.
Such arrays were already successfully used in association with short pulse UV-lasers for photo-injectors
systems [14], and could be interesting for photon-detection systems. Tests were performed with
silicon-made tips arrays in order to test the efficiency with X-rays.
6.2.3 A new material: CsI3
In parallel to the work made to enhance the emission properties of known materials by changing the
geometry of those materials, new materials were investigated. Following the example of CsI, which
is currently the best material in terms of quantum efficiency, various iodide were studied.
In particular, CsI3 as a derivative material of CsI was found to share some interesting physical

Experimental tests and discussion of the
results
Not all the different approaches to improve the photocathodes were experimentally tested. In partic-
ular, the indirect conversion photocathodes were not actually fabricated, for no good combinations
of scintillators and emitters could be found. Otherwise, most ideas to improve the photocathode
quantum efficiencies were tested. This section follows the structure of the previous one and gives the
experimental results obtained.
7.1 Modify the geometry to increase the yield of a material
As previously explained, the approach of modifying the geometry of one material consists in benefiting
from the increasing of the quantum efficiency in the case of an oblique incidence of photons on the
surface of the photocathode material. Only samples potentially manufacturable as large surfaces were
used.
Mainly two types of structured photocathodes were tested:
Random Structures were actually sand paper materials normally used for the coarsing of surfaces.
The different grades of papers enabled to test further the impact of the structure sizes on the
quantum efficiency.
Periodic Pyramidal Structures were special sorts of sand paper available in a very special and
periodic shape. They are normally used for highly demanding polishing applications (in terms
of uniformity, and robustness of the paper).
The reference sample was a flat Kapton foil.
Those samples were covered with 0.2−0.4 µm of gold by argon ion sputtering (the thickness could not
be precisely controlled, so the thickness was evaluated thanks to the given deposition characteristics
of the machine). This thickness was sufficient to ensure a maximum yield (thickness greater than the
escape length) while not changing radically the structure shapes.
102 Experimental tests and discussion of the results
7.1.1 Analysis of the microstructures characteristics
Several samples were created and their structures were analyzed both with an optical and a scanning
electron microscope (SEM).
First a flat kapton foil was taken as a reference photocathode.
For the random structures, the samples were the following (SEM images):
Figure 7.1 : Grade 280 sam- Figure 7.2 : Grade 800 sam- Figure 7.3 : Grade 1200 sam-
ple: Random structures of sizes ∼ ple: Random structures of sizes ∼ ple. Random structures of sizes ∼
100 µm. 20 µm. 10 µm.
Those samples were made with normal sand paper, normally used for grinding of surfaces. Higher
grades correspond to a finer smoothening, so structures are smaller and more numerous. The sizes
indicated under each pictures (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) are those of the largest structures (covering most of the
surface), and are always surrounded with smaller structures.
For the periodic structures, the special Trizact 143 paper by the company 3M was used. Those
structures are obtained by positive engraving in a special polymer and are available in large areas.

The side surfaces form an angle of∼ 57o with respect to the base plane (averaged on several pyramids).
7.2 Field Emission 103
7.1.2 Efficiency measurements
The different samples presented were all covered with a layer of gold of thickness ∼ 0.3 µm. This
thickness is far bigger than the escape length of gold (a few nm), so there is no contribution to the
yield from the substrate. The structures are much larger than the gold thickness, and there was
no attenuation observed of the quantum efficiency due to a ”smoothening” of the surface by the
deposited layer (different thickness of deposited gold gave the same results).
The results are presented compared to a flat surface of gold obtained in the same conditions in table
7.1 (X-ray tube parameters: 20kV acceleration voltage, 20mA intensity, with Cu anode):
Substrate Gold Thickness (µm) Measured Current (pA)

Sand Paper Grad 1200 0.3 19.4± 0.9
Trizact 143 0.3 34.65± 1.7
Table 7.1 : Results intensities of gold covered structured paper
The best sample is the Trizact 143, which indeed offers the largest inclined surface (so a higher active
area). It should be noted that with respect to the flat Kapton sample, there is a factor
34.65 ≈ 11.87 = = 1.83
18.5 cos(57)
as predicted by the formula in section 6.2.1.
Sand Paper do not give results as good as the periodic trizact samples, probably because the structure
covered surface is much smaller than that of the trizact samples.
7.2 Field Emission
Silicon sharp tips were obtained and tested to evaluate their potential in the case of X-ray photo-
cathodes.
7.2.1 Analysis of the microstructure characteristics
The sample is formed of a periodic array of 4.5 µm separated tips, engraved in a silicon wafer.
104 Experimental tests and discussion of the results
Figure 7.6 : Si Tips Array SEM images at 10 µm and 2 µm resolution. No better image could be obtained
because of space charge effects.
Due to the small dimension of the tips, neither the SEM images nor the optical ones enabled us to
obtain detailed information about their shape. Yet the SEM images do show an effect of emission
enhancement at the tips tops (Figure 7.6).
7.2.2 Efficiency Measurements
The measurement of the quantum efficiency of silicon tips as X-ray photocathodes showed that silicon
tips are not a good choice for no signal could be detected. This demonstrates that the yield is very
small.
This can be explained by the small stopping power of silicon in the case of X-ray photons. For
photons penetrate deeply in the material before being stopped, the electrons are created too far
from the surface to drift and exit the bulk (in the case of moderate electric field as presented in the
simulations detailed in section 6.2.2).
It is likely that a strong electric field could enhance the yield, but such a field is not compatible with
gas amplification.
7.3 CsI3 as a new photocathodes material
7.3.0.1 Physical and chemical characteristics
CsI is a dark reddish-brown solid material, with a standard density of 4.51 g/cm−33 , and melting
point of 207.5oC. Its crystal structure was first studied in 1925 by Bozorth et al.[?], and later refined
by H.A.Tasman et al. and by J.Runsink et al.[?, ?] and belongs to space group Pmcn.
Extensive studies (complete phase diagram) on the manufacturing of polyiodides of caesium can be
found in [?] ; the material is also available from major chemicals companies such as Sigma-Aldrich
or Alfa Aesar or can be easily synthesized from CsI and I2 [?].
7.3 CsI3 as a new photocathodes material 105
It is not stable under vacuum at room temperature but it releases I2. L.E.Topol indicates in [?] that
the partial vapor pressure can be obtained from the formula
−4269 + 0.20(T − 273)
log(PCsI3 [Torr]) = − 2.013 log T + 16.2548. (7.1)T
In particular, at a temperature of 25oC, P ≈ 10−3Torr = 1.33 · 10−3 mBar and at 40oCsI3 C:
P ≈ 4.14 · 10−3 Torr = 5.51 · 10−3CsI3 mBar.
More detail (including (E−Eo), ∆G associated to the system CsI −CsI3) can be found in [?]. The
differential free enthalpy is ∆o = −358 kJmol−1f .
Indeed when CsI3 was left on the photocathode holder in vacuum, a layer on surroundings metals
appeared, which is a sign of reaction with I2 (the layer showed the same aspect as when exposed to
vapors of I2 obtained from solid iodide). Also the color of the sample rapidly changed to a brighter
one (yellowish, after a few hours in vacuum), which is also a sign of the appearance of CsI at the
surface (CsI is white or transparent, depending on its crystallinity). After 1 week in vacuum at a
pressure of ∼ 10−5 the sample had lost as much as 12 % of its weight. Unfortunately we could not
leave it under vacuum for a longer time to test further the stability of solid blocks (to check whether
there is only surface transformation, which acts like a passivation layer, or deeper degradation and
if a denser block would degrade the same way). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis
confirms an evolution of the material microstructure (see figures 7.7 and 7.8):
Kept in air at atmospheric pressure, there was no visible evolution after several months, apart from
the plastic box, which turned into red (like it did with other compounds such as AuI, known to re-
lease I2), which indicates that the evolution is slow, as soon as the equilibrium pressure of I2 is reached.
7.3.1 The CsI3 samples
Different flavors of CsI3 samples were obtained and tested. For each the analysis of the microstructure
and the quantum efficiency measurements were performed. CsI3 is unstable under vacuum, so an
analysis of the microstructure evolution under vacuum was performed.
Samples of CsI3 were created following two ways:
1. CsI3 was ordered from the company Sigma-Aldrich, and pressed into a pellet with a die-press
set. A pressure of 3.5 GPa was enough to obtain a solid sample.
2. CsI samples were exposed to I2 vapors (CsI with solid I2 in a closed bottle in a furnace at
30oC). The solid state reaction is very slow. We had to wait several days to observe a reaction
of the bulk of the material. This method has the advantage that it is possible to compare
directly nearly identical CsI and CsI3 samples.
CsI3 samples obtained were tested and compared with CsI and gold. CsI is an isolator, therefore
it is hard to test due to charging effects. To overcome the space charge, conductive CsI(C) samples
were made, and compared with CsI3(C).
106 Experimental tests and discussion of the results
7.3.1.1 Preparation of the different samples
Samples obtained from CsI3 as supplied
CsI3 was obtained from the company Sigma-Aldrich (the vendor guaranties a purity better than
99.99x %).
The product came as a fine powder, which was then pressed into a pellet in an hydraulic press die,
at a pressure of 4GPa for 5 minutes.
Samples obtained from a CsI crystals, in presence of I2 vapors
Samples of CsI(T l) crystals grown for fluorescence applications were obtained from the company
Saint-Gobain.
The samples come in the form of a polished crystal (transparent to light, colorless). It was then
exposed to I vapors at a temperature of ∼ 40o2 C for several days. Already after a few minutes, the
color of the crystal had changed into one very close to that of CsI3. After several weeks in presence
of I2, the sample is hard to distinguish from the one obtained from the CsI3 powder.
CsI was also tested. To do this, it was placed rapidly after opening (less than 5 minutes in air) on the
experimental setup in vacuum and tested. Unfortunately, this test was not relevant, as explained later.
Samples obtained from a powder of CsI mixed with carbon in order to reduce
the space charge
The CsI crystals from St Gobain could not be tested directly because of charging effects. So high
purity CsI powder (from the company Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with graphite in order to increase
its conductivity. Those samples enabled to have a direct comparison of CsI and CsI3.
Because CsI is an hygroscopic material, all manipulations were done under protecting atmosphere, in
a glove box. The sample was then rapidly mounted on the experimental setup (less than 5 minutes)
and put under vacuum for testing.
The received CsI was grained and mixed with graphite in a mortar. The sample composition was
0.5 % of graphite-carbon and 99.5 % high purity CsI.
It was then removed from the glove box, put in a die and pressed at 6 GPa for 2 minutes. Immediately
after it was mounted and put under vacuum. Such a way, the sample stayed less than 5 minutes in
air between its removal from the glove box, and the start of the pump.
A second sample prepared the same way, was treated in iodine vapors in order to transform it to
CsI (C) (left in a furnace at a temperature of 40o3 C for one week).
Porous CsI Photocathodes
Porous CsI photocathodes by the company Luxel were tested for comparison purpose. Those pho-
tocathodes have a microstructure, which is optimized for a use in X-ray cameras. They give an
indication of the maximum yield obtainable with CsI. Those photocathode are shipped in a sealed
flask filled with an inert gas to protect them from moisture. As for the previous samples, they were
mounted in the clean room and evacuated in less than five minutes.
7.3 CsI3 as a new photocathodes material 107
7.3.1.2 Analysis of the microstructures of the samples and their evolution
The CsI3 samples were stored in the clean room, in non hermetic plastic boxes. No visible change
of aspect could be observed after several months, and no evolution of the microstructure was visible
with the scanning electron microscope.
However, under vacuum a clear evolution was observed. Details of the sample evolution under vac-
uum are the following:
Samples obtained from pure CsI3
The evolution of the microstructure of the sample was observed by SEM (a Gemini Leo 1530 ):
The surface microstructure of the pressed sample is depicted in the Figure 7.7.
Figure 7.7 : CsI3 as pressed SEM images. Left image is a large field picture with resolution ∼ 10 µm,
right image is a closer view with resolution ∼ 2 µm.
This sample was left for one week under vacuum at a pressure of ∼ 10−6 mbar. The sample was then
re-examined by SEM. The result is depicted in Figure 7.8.

is a large field picture with resolution ∼ 2 µm, right image is a closer view with resolution ∼ 1 µm.
108 Experimental tests and discussion of the results
There is a clear evolution in the microstructure, which has become much more porous. In the mean
time, the color of the sample changed from dark to a white yellowish one (close to the color of CsI).
This is further indication of the reaction
CsI3 
 CsI + I2. (7.2)
Samples obtained from CsI exposed to I2
The study of the samples made from CsI3 enabled to study the microstructure evolution of the
material in vacuum. It is also interesting to study the evolution of microstructure of samples of CsI
after they were exposed to I2 and then placed in vacuum.
The following pictures depict the evolution of the samples made of pure CsI mixed with 0.5 % of
carbon: ”CsI(C)”.
As pressed, the microstructure of this sample is depicted in Figure 7.9.
Figure 7.9 : CsI(C) at 20 (left), 10(center), and 2 µm resolution (right).
After exposure to I2 for two days, no visible evolution of the microstructure was observed.
But after one night in vacuum, the structure becomes the following (Figure 7.10).
Figure 7.10 : CsI(C) at 20 (left), 10 (center), and 2 µm resolution (right) after the sample was exposed to
I2 and placed one night in vacuum.
The samples obtained from the CsI(T l) crystals show the same evolution (visible on Figure 7.11).
7.3 CsI3 as a new photocathodes material 109
Figure 7.11 : CsI(T l) Crystal by St Gobain Before any treatment (left), and after it was exposed to
I2, and placed one night in vacuum (right).
Before any treatment, most of the surface is flat like on picture 7.11 left (polished sample). The
right picture highlights the complete change of the surface after the exposure to I2 and vacuum.
This evolution follows the same trend as for the compacted CsI3 samples. The difference of obtained
microstructure can be explained by the difference of the CsI microstructure before exposure to I2.
When the structures are left in vacuum for longer periods, no visible change occurs at the surface.
Porous samples of CsI
Those samples are obtained from the company Luxel and have a microstructure optimized for the
detection of X-rays in streak cameras.
Indeed they show a spongy structure as depicted in pictures 7.12.
Figure 7.12 : CsI optimized for streak cameras from the company Luxel. The left SEM image is shot
with a resolution of ∼ 20µm, the right one with a resolution of ∼ 1µm. Space charges on the sample prevented
us from obtaining a better image.
As presented in section 6.2.1.1, this sort of structure is a way to obtain a large surface of the material
110 Experimental tests and discussion of the results
and then, a large active area (cf. 6.2.1).
It should be noted that this sample has a microstructure which is similar to that of the CsI samples
exposed to I2 and then placed in vacuum.
So the exposure to I2 appears as a way to obtain a granular microstructure of the CsI.
This is an important result, as this method is much easier than the complex deposition
processes normally used to obtain such materials.
This result will be further detailed in the conclusion concerning the use of CsI3 as a photocathode
material.
7.3.2 CsI3 quantum efficiency and comparison with CsI.
The quantum efficiency of CsI3 was evaluated and compared to that of CsI, both before and after
exposure to air. See chapter 5 for details concerning the experimental setup.
7.3.2.1 The quantum efficiency of CsI and its evolution in air
measurement of the quantum efficiency of clean CsI
Those measurements were done for calibration and comparison purpose, as this subject was already
widely studied in the past.
Yet, few authors provide results of the quantum efficiency after exposure to air (at best short exposures
and techniques to recover the virgin quantum efficiency [29, ?, ?, ?, 32]).
The best quantum efficiency one can obtain is measured in our case by the quantum efficiency of
the samples provided by the Luxel company. Those samples are optimized for a very high quantum
efficiency: thick deposited layers, with an adapted microstructure.
The best quantum efficiency, was obtained right after introduction of the sample in the chamber.
With our setup, a maximum current of 1144 ± 57 pA was recorded. The second sample gave
1115± 55 pA (3% difference, can be attributed to a slight degradation of the sample during its ma-
nipulation, or to a difference in the sample itself).
Those results were compared with the samples obtained from the CsI mixed with 0.5 % of carbon.
The intensity obtained was 144± 7.2 pA.
While this lower intensity can be explained by an effect of the structure of the sample (as explained
before, prior exposure to I2, the surface of the CsI(C) sample was very flat), it is likely that the
condition of cleanness during the preparation of the chamber cannot guaranty a maximum quantum
efficiency of the CsI photocathode prepared this way: the quantum efficiency of CsI as a secondary
emitter depend strongly on the state of cleanness of the sample surface (cf. section 3.3.4). For
the CsI used to prepare the sample was grained and pressed during the preparation process (see sec-

tion 7.3.1.1), it can have been polluted, despite of the care taken to clean the mortar and the die used.
Evolution of the quantum efficiency of the porous CsI in vacuum and after
exposure to air
CsI is known for being sensitive to pollution, and in particular to moisture. Tests were performed in
order to compare its stability with that of CsI3.
• Evolution of the quantum efficiency of CsI in vacuum.
The vacuum in which the measurements were performed is not ultra high. The measured pressure
next to the chamber was in the range 10−5 to 10−4 mbar. This pressure is high enough to cause
contamination of the surface on the long-term.
Under such conditions, a degradation of the quantum efficiency of the porous CsI was recorded
only after a few days: the quantum efficiency after 2 days was at a value of 1040 ± 52 pA. This
corresponds to a drop of quantum efficiency of 9%.
This highlights the necessity to keep the photocathode in a very clean environment, as already
reported.
In the same time, no drop of intensity was recorded in the case of the sample CsI(C).
• Evolution of the quantum efficiency of CsI in air.
The evolution of the quantum efficiency after exposure to air is just a way to study the evolution of
the quantum efficiency of the photocathode when it is left in a more aggressive environment.
The different samples of CsI were just left in a protecting box, inside the clean room. So the samples
are still in a controlled environment, but in particular there was no protection against moisture, which
is known as the worst enemy of CsI photocathodes.
It turns out the evolution of the quantum efficiency is much more dramatic, than when the photo-
cathode is kept in vacuum (table 7.2):
After one night in air, the intensity was 736 ± 36 pA, which corresponds to a relative drop of
35 % of the quantum efficiency.
After one month in air, the intensity was only 113± 5.6 pA. So only 10% of the original quantum
efficiency was left.
No change of intensity was recorded for the sample of CsI(C) in the same time. This is a further
indication that the sample was already degraded at the time of the first measurement.

7.3.2.2 The quantum efficiency of CsI3, its evolution in air and comparison with CsI.
The quantum efficiency of CsI3 was evaluated the same way as CsI, except that in addition to
those measurements, after exposure to air, CsI3 samples were eventually put back in an atmosphere
saturated with I2 and then they were tested again.
Following the evolution of the microstructure presented in the last section, there is an evolution of
the CsI3 photocathode quantum efficiency when left in vacuum.
For all the samples of CsI3 prepared do not have the same microstructure, all the quantum efficiencies
of the various samples are not equal. Yet they all follow the same trend concerning the evolution of
their quantum efficiencies.
First, the sample made of ”CsI3(C)” is detailed here. Then a comparison of the maxi-
mum intensities of the different samples is given.
The sample ”CsI3(C)”
• Evolution of the quantum efficiency after introduction in the chamber under vacuum.
The sample made of CsI(C) after it was tested as a CsI sample was put in presence of I2 vapors for
two days, at a temperature of 40oC. The obtained CsI3(C) was then tested.
At the introduction in the chamber, the intensity was 160± 8.0 pA and rapidly evolved (table 7.3).
The maximum intensity was then ∼ 230 ± 11 pA. The microstructure then corresponds to Figure
7.10.
No further evolution of the intensity was recorded, so the sample was removed from the chamber.
• Evolution of the quantum efficiency when left in air.
The sample was then left for a long period (1 month) in air in the clean room (storage in a plastic
box). After only one day the sample had lost a great part of its quantum efficiency, for the measured
intensity was then 93± 4.6 pA. This evolution did not go further, and after one month, the quantum
efficiency was still 92± 4.6 pA (table 7.4).

introduction in vacuum, one month stay in air, and Re-exposure to I2.
After the CsI sample was exposed to I2, there is an increase of efficiency when it is left in air. The
sample then becomes sensitive to pollution, and an exposure to air results in a drop of efficiency.
A re-exposure to I2 enables to recover the lost efficiency, and is even beneficial for the maximum
intensity obtained is then higher than after direct introduction of the sample.
A further cycle of exposure to I2 and stay in vacuum gave the same results.
CsI crystal from St Gobain.
As already explained, the performances of the CsI crystal by St Gobain could not be measured,
because of space charging. Only after it was exposed to I2 it became conductive enough to enable
measurements.
After a long exposure to I2, as highlighted by the microstructure and color changes, a part of the
sample turned into CsI3.

The performances and behavior after exposure to vacuum and I2 of this sample are similar to those
of the ”CsI(C)” and pressed pellet samples (table 7.6).
Then, after only one week in air, the intensity recorded was only 68± 3.4 pA.
After it was exposed to I2 for a few days, the intensity rose to approximately the same value of
154± 7.7 pA again.
So this sample follows the same trend as the previous one except that a second exposure to I2 does
not enable a bettering of the efficiency, but only a recovery of this efficiency after pollution of the
sample by air.

The CsI photocathode from Luxel.
A tentative was made to use the CsI photocathode from Luxel to make a CsI3 one as with the crystal
by St Gobain. Unfortunately, it turned out that the Aluminized mylar substrate used to grow the
photocathode is very reactive to I2. It was not the CsI of the photocathode, which reacted with I2,
but the aluminum of the substrate itself.
So the only way to obtain a CsI3 photocathode from this sample was to put in open air, a solid iodine
grain on the CsI deposited layer (Figure 7.14). The grains were deposited around the measured area,

of the measurements of the photocurrent.
It is evident that such a method cannot guaranty a good homogeneity of the CsI3 surface. So the
result of those measurement must be taken with caution.
When the sample was removed from the chamber, it was completely white. So, if the value at the
time of introduction is likely to be a measurement of the quantum efficiency of CsI3, then, the sample
progressively changed back into CsI.
This measurement was performed right after measuring the quantum efficiency of CsI, so the last
value is a measurement of clean (less than a few minutes in air in total) but transformed -see struc-
tural analysis- CsI.
CsI3 pressed pellets
The evolution of the quantum efficiency of the samples made of compacted CsI3 follows the same
trend as those obtained from CsI exposed to I2. At the introduction, the samples typically return
an intensity of 120± 6 pA, and this values rises in a few hours to typical values of 200± 10 pA (table
7.8).
In the meantime, as explained earlier, the surface changes color, and the microstructure evolves as
depicted earlier.
A tentative of study of the stability on the long-term was performed by leaving one of the samples
of compacted CsI3 in vacuum. But after one week, two pumps had broken, so the experiment was
stopped (it is likely that the I2 release was at the origin of this failure).
Still, the transformation of this sample had probably gone deeper than with the other samples, and

the color of surface had change to a brighter color than the one of the samples, which stayed only
one or two complete days in vacuum.
After this, the two samples (the one pumped 1 week, and the one pumped only for the primary
measurements: few hours) were left for one month in a plastic box in the clean room, and were tested
again.
It turned out that the quantum efficiency of both samples evolved very differently.
At their reintroduction in the chamber, the intensities were rather different (table 7.9):
• The sample, which had stayed only a few hours in vacuum had an intensity of 188± 9.4 pA.
• The sample, which had stayed one week in vacuum had an intensity of only 31± 1.5 pA.
No real evolution was then recorded. So the samples were put in presence of I2 vapors. After two
days, the sample, which had been left only a few hours in vacuum was dark again, while the color of
the sample which had been left in vacuum for one week did not change color. The quantum efficiencies
of the two samples were tested again (table 7.10).
The sample which had stayed only a few hours recovered like the other samples its quantum efficiency,
while the one which had stayed a long time in vacuum, kept a very low quantum efficiency. No further
stay in I2 of the sample left 1 week in vacuum could change its color, and its quantum efficiency did
not change neither (same value of ∼ 35± 1.75pA).
Later, a tentative to remove mechanically the bright layer was successful: it detached easily when
pressed by tweezers.
The uncovered layer was then tested, and showed similar properties to those of the freshly made

sample.
Summary
The typical values obtained with the different samples can be found in the table 7.11.
It appears that, despite the variations in the precise values, the general trend is the same for the
different samples.
Some general conclusions can be already given when looking at the different values:
• Contrary to CsI, CsI3 seems to be insensitive to air.
• The quantum efficiency of CsI3 is lower than clean CsI (from the Luxel sample, probably a
factor 7), but better than exposed to air CsI.
• When exposed to I2 and then put in vacuum at least twice, the quantum efficiency is increased.
This does not further increase after two cycles yet.
• A too long stay of CsI3 in vacuum makes the sensitivity to air rise, and I2 treatment does not
enable to recover the best efficiency.
Also, both ways to obtain CsI3 samples (from CsI and CsI3) seem to be equivalent as they offer
similar values at the time of introduction.
7.3.3 Analysis of the results obtained with CsI3
The behavior of the CsI3 as a photocathode can be explained by a transformation of the outer layer,
following the reaction
CsI3 
 CsI + I2 (1)
The CsI3 samples, when put in vacuum transform according to the reaction (1) in the left to right
direction, so a layer of fresh CsI is formed at the surface of the sample. This is visible by the change
of color from dark red (CsI3) to yellow-white (CsI).
The different test with pure CsI and CsI3 show that CsI is a better emitter, so there is an increase
of quantum efficiency when this reaction occurs, until all the CsI3 of the active layer of the photo-
cathode transformed in CsI.
The reaction does not stop as the I2 released in the chamber is pumped, so the equilibrium vapor
pressure is never reached. Eventually, a thick layer of CsI is formed on top of the sample, which
corresponds to the one removed mechanically from the CsI3 pressed pellet after it stayed one week
in vacuum.
When left in a plastic box, there is no evolution of the microstructure, or of the emission character-
istics, at least in the time scale of a few months. This indicates that when the equilibrium vapor
pressure of I2 is reached, there is no evolution of CsI3.
When I2 is released, there is a change of the surface microstructure as shown by the SEM pictures.
This evolution is in favor of a greater quantum efficiency of the CsI left: the microstructure becomes

porous, which betters the quantum efficiency of CsI as already known.
If the samples of CsI3 are left in air after a long stay under vacuum, the thick layer of CsI gets
polluted and the quantum efficiency of the photocathode drops rapidly, like it does for pure CsI
samples. After a short stay in vacuum, CsI3 seem to be less sensible to air pollution.
It seems that the state of degradation of the CsI layer (after a stay in air, so after exposure to
moisture) has an impact on the possibility to re-transform in CsI3.
In conclusion:
• If the CsI3 did not stay too long in vacuum, it can be ”recovered” (the formed CsI layer can
retransform in CsI3) even after a long stay in air.
• If the CsI3 stayed a long time in vacuum, the recover can occur only after a short exposure to
air.
This indicates that exposure to I2 does not enable to regenerate a thick layer of degraded CsI (or
that the reaction is much slower).
7.3.4 Conclusion on the use of CsI3 as a photocathode
The study performed on CsI3 show that it is itself an interesting photocathode, providing a good
quantum efficiency, and a good robustness to pollution and moisture. It has the disadvantage that it
is unstable in vacuum, so it is mandatory to let the gas in the detector reach the equilibrium vapor
pressure to enable its use as a photocathode.
The most promising approach is its use as a precursor to CsI. Indeed, CsI3 is not an emitter
as good as CsI in terms of quantum efficiency. But its instability under vacuum and its insensitivity
to air degradation makes it a very attractive choice to create porous CsI photocathode.
Indeed, as the material is very easy to manipulate in air, it is very easy to place the photocathode in
gas-filled detectors. Then, simply pumping the chamber enables to obtain a porous CsI photocathode,
which is the best photocathode available (eventually several cycles of pumping and exposure to I2
can be necessary to obtain the best structure / quantum efficiency).
Later maintenance operations are also easier to perform if the photocathode is first exposed to I2, it
then transforms in CsI3, which makes it much more robust to air damages. This method does not
enable to recover the efficiency of a CsI which was severely polluted though.
This study shows that CsI3 can potentially be a good way to fabricate porous CsI photocathodes.

Conclusion
The aim of this work was to develop new photocathodes with improved quantum efficiency and ro-
bustness to allow their use as a first stage X-ray electron converter in gas-filled detectors.
This implied both theoretical studies and practical experiments to identify the most promising tech-
niques to develop such device.
This work allowed the development of a simulation tool using a Monte Carlo method for prospecting
new materials and structures. It turned out that the tool could not simulate properly the photocath-
odes’ physics, leading to unreliable results. Deep investigations highlighted that it was the method
and not the specific program, which is adequate for such simulations. The Monte Carlo method can
be used to develop material already well known and better understand them, by developing specific
codes for this material. Unfortunately, this approach is of no help to investigate prospective materials,
which properties are not known. This limit finds its root in the strong variation of the electrons dy-
namic in the bulk and at the surface of the material with its precise structure and chemical state. So
any Monte Carlo Study of a photocathode material implies a deep study of the materials properties,
which is just longer than a direct experimental study.
Still the development of this tool helped in understanding the key parameters which govern one pho-
tocathode quantum efficiency.
In order to enable reliable tests of the quantum efficiency of the photocathodes, an experimental setup
was developed and built. This setup showed excellent characteristics, as it was able to measure very
weak photocurrents, while being very flexible. Currents of less than 1 fA were successfully measured.
The setup then served as a basis for all study of the quantum efficiency of prospective photocathodes.
The last part of the work consisted in developing methods to better the quantum efficiency of photo-
cathodes. Various approaches were investigated, and eventually experimentally tested. In particular,
the study of the impact of microstructures on the material efficiency was performed, and the in-
124 Conclusion
vestigation of a scintillator-low energy photocathode system was performed. The most promising
approach, and which was more extensively investigated is the use of CsI3 as a precursor to CsI,
which is currently the best known photocathode.
The use of CsI3 as a photocathode is advantageous in several ways:
• Contrary to CsI, CsI3 is not hygroscopic, and is rather resistant to pollution. Thus, it can be
easily manipulated in air.
• When put in vacuum, it releases I2, and transforms in CsI with a porous structure. Porous
CsI is known for being the best photocathode in terms of quantum efficiency. So CsI3 is a way
to obtain structured photocathodes, without using complex evaporation systems, which enable
the growth of porous CsI photocathode. A simple deposition of CsI3 or even of unstructured
CsI later exposed to I2 vapors is enough to obtain a structured CsI photocathode.
• The reaction CsI3 
 CsI + I2 is reversible. So one can protect CsI from air pollution by
exposing it to an atmosphere saturated with iodine. This is a very attracting method for it
simplifies dramatically the maintenance operations.
So the use of CsI3 as a photocathode is technologically promising. It can lead to the fabrication
of gas-filled detectors, which can answer the growing need of fast, large areas counting detectors in
photon science...
Further study will need to validate experimentally this approach to create and protect CsI photo-
cathodes.

Detector characteristics
A.1 Position resolution in the case of gas-filled detectors
The spatial resolution gives information on the accuracy of the position returned by the detector.
The position resolution is the result of four main contributions [1]:
σ = (σ2 + σ2 + σ2 + σ2 )1/2det noise diff er aval .
where
• σnoise is the r.m.s contribution from the electronic noise. I depends on the type of readout.
• σdiff is the contribution due to electrons diffusion.
• σer is the contribution from Auger electrons and photoelectrons.
• σaval is the contribution from avalanche centroid fluctuation. It is due to statistical variations
and varies greatly with gas gain. It is often the main contributor and depends on both pressure
and gas mixture.
More details on each contributions can be found in [1] and in chapter 4 of [2].
A.2 Energy Resolution
The Energy resolution is usually defined as the full width half maximum of the spectral response of
the detector to a given energy.
Indeed, with an excellent prec√ision(∼ 1%), the response has a gaussian shape. More precisely, The
resolution R is given by: R = (electronic noise)2 + (Fano)2:
→ Electronic noise gives the contribution of the electronic to the error of measurement. This
term is itself the result of several contributions.
→ Fano is the contribution due to the Fano Statistics: the generation of electrons and holes
charges is the result of a statistical process. The energy of the incoming particle/photon is
126 Detector characteristics
shared between lattice excitation (∼ 2/3) and the√generation of charge carriers (∼ 1/3). The
resultant spread in energy is FWHMFano = 2.35 FεE with ε being the charge pair creation
energy (ex. 3.63eV/e-h for Si), F the Fano factor (F ≈ 0.12 for Si, F is not a constant), and
E the energy.
A.3 Space Charging in gas-filled detectors
The space charging effect is important because it can be physical limitation to counting rate char-
acteristics. Two methods have been given by Sipilia et al. in 1980 and later by Mathieson et al. in
1992 [3, 4].
It concerns the reduction of the electric field between the anode and cathode due to ions in the volume.
This presence is unavoidable for the amplification process necessarily creates such ions (ionization
avalanche). The two models calculate the effective field reduction at the anode surface.

Monte Carlo Application Examples
B.1 Simple Examples of statistical sampling methods
In this section, some of the most classical example of statistical sampling methods are given. Those
methods can be considered as particular application of the Monte Carlo Method1.
B.1.1 Calculus of an integral
As a first approach to the Monte Carlo method, an example of calculation of an integral is given:
Let assume the function φ is to be integrated between a and b:
∫ b N∑−1 b− a 1 b− a
Φ(t)dt = Φ(xi) +O( ) with xi = a+ − i.a N N N 1i=0
This is the classical formula of the trapezoidal rule.
Instead of a uniform sampling, imagine an evaluation where the positions {xi} are random numbers
uniformly distributed in the interval [a, b]; this yields a Monte Carlo integration:
∫ b ∑N b− a √1Φ(t)dt = Φ(xi) +O( ) with a ≤ xi ≤ b.
a N Ni=1
In this particular exa√mple, the methods appears to be less efficient than the trapezoidal rule for its
absolute error is in 1/ N instead of 1/N . Though the Monte Carlo approach has a strong advantage
over it: it is independent of the number of dimensions. So, contrary to the uniform sampling, which
has an error scaling as N−1/d, the Monte Carlo Method will stay with an error scaling as N−1/2.
This is a direct consequence of the central limit theorem.
1The name statistical sampling method is used instead of Monte Carlo Method, for those methods were developed
before the name Monte Carlo Method was given and presented as a general method.
130 Monte Carlo Application Examples
B.1.2 An historical example: Buffon’s needles
One of the first statistical approach to solve a mathematical problem is due to the mathematician
Comte de Buffon.
Figure B.1 : Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon Figure B.2 : The needle problem by Buffon
He invented a method to calculate an approximation of pi. Here is the problem he solved, which leads
to the approximation method of pi: if a needle of length l is dropped several times on a horizontal
surface ruled of parallel lines separated of a distance d¿l, what is the probability ℘ that the needle
cross one line?
That outcome will happen only if 0 6 A 6 d and 0 6 θ < pi.
If we assume that the vector (A, θ) is randomly distributed on the region [0, d[×[0, pi[, then the
probability 1∫d∫ensity function is dpi , and the probability that the needle cross the line is:pi l sin θ 1
℘ = dAdθ
0 0 dpi
2l E(M)
So the probability is ℘ = = if M is the random variable for the number of times the needle
dpi n
cross the line, and n the number of drops.
n 2l
It appears that is a statistical estimator for pi. So to determine pi, one can evaluate E(M),
E(M) d
which is easily done, just dropping needles.

Introduction
Ce travail de the`se vise a` explorer diffe´rentes voies d’ame´lioration de l’efficacite´ des photocathodes.
Plus ge´ne´ralement, il prend place dans le de´veloppement de de´tecteurs a` gaz de rayons X de grandes
surfaces, susceptibles de re´pondre aux besoins croissants en matie`re de vitesse et de taille des de´tecteurs
utilise´s dans les domaines du me´dical et de la recherche mobilisant le rayonnement synchrotron.
Les photocathodes pour de´tecteurs a` amplification par gaz
De´tecteurs a` 2 dimensions
Les de´tecteurs a` 2 dimensions (ou a` 1 dimension) sont par opposition aux de´tecteurs ponctuels
capables de fournir une information spatiale sur la particule de´tecte´e.
Ce type de de´tecteur pre´sente l’e´norme avantage qu’il dispense de syste`mes me´caniques pour couvrir
l’ensemble de l’espace (dans le cas de l’espace re´el comme re´ciproque). Ainsi il est possible d’effectuer
beaucoup plus rapidement les expe´riences d’imagerie. Certaines expe´riences ne´cessitent meˆme l’utili-
sation de de´tecteur 2D, soit pour des raisons de temps d’exe´cution autrement trop longs (cas de la
tomographie 3D par exemple) soit meˆme pour des raisons de de´gradation de l’e´chantillon qui ne peut
supporter le faisceau qu’un temps tre`s court (notamment dans les domaines de la biologie ou dans le
cas des analyses me´dicales !).
Les de´tecteurs a` amplification par gaz
Les de´tecteurs a` amplification par gaz (aussi appele´s  de´tecteurs gazeux ), sont parmi les plus
vieux syste`mes de de´tection de rayonnement ionisant. Ils sont en particulier les premiers a` avoir offert
132 Re´sume´
une de´tection e´lectronique du passage d’un rayonnement ou d’une particule ionisante.
L’exemple le plus ce´le`bre de ce type de de´tecteur est le Tube Geiger introduit par Geiger etMueller
en 1928 apre`s que Geiger et Rutherford aient de´couvert le principe de la multiplication e´lectronique
dans un gaz.
Ces de´tecteurs sont base´s sur une multiplication interne des e´lectrons ionise´s a` la suite d’un de´poˆt
d’e´nergie par la particule/le rayonnement traversant le gaz. Cette multiplication des e´lectrons est
rendue possible par la pre´sence d’un champ e´lectrique au sein de la chambre a` gaz, qui acce´le`re
les charges pre´sentes. Si l’e´nergie cine´tique gagne´e par ces charges entre deux collisions avec une
mole´cule du gaz est supe´rieure a` l’e´nergie d’ionisation d’une particule de gaz (typiquement 35eV),
alors la particule devient susceptible de ioniser une particule de gaz, et est donc a` la source d’une
cascade de ionisation. L’augmentation exponentielle du nombre de charges permet alors une de´tection
aise´e par simple collection des charges sur des e´lectrodes.
Les de´tecteurs a` gaz constituent maintenant une technologie mature. Ils ont comme avantage principal
de permettre la fabrication de de´tecteurs de grande dimension et rapides a` un couˆt acceptable, tout
en permettant un fonctionnement en comptage (par opposition aux de´tecteurs fonctionnants avec
des e´crans fluorescents, qui impliquent un mode d’ope´ration en inte´gration, et donc un bruit plus
important).
Ils pre´sentent aussi des inconve´nients, notamment un phe´nome`ne de parallax, qui de´grade fortement
la re´solution dans le cas des incidences obliques, et une efficacite´ quantique limite´e notamment aux
e´nergies supe´rieures a` 10keV. En effet, l’efficacite´ d’absorption du gaz augmente avec la pression,
alors que l’efficacite´ d’amplification est optimum pour les faibles pressions.
Une approche pour contrebalancer ces deux inconve´nients, consiste en l’utilisation de photocathodes
solides comme convertisseurs photon → e´lectrons, permettant ainsi une se´paration (et donc une
optimisation se´pare´e) des deux fonctions d’absorption et d’amplification.
Les photocathodes de´die´s a` une utilisation dans des de´tecteurs a` gaz
Les photocathodes permettent une conversion de la lumie`re incidente en e´lectrons par le biais de
l’effet photoe´lectrique.
Les photocathodes ont principalement e´te´ utilise´es au sein de photomultiplicateurs, dans lesquels elles
sont couple´es a` une se´rie de dynodes, capables d’amplifier fortement le signal e´lectrique.
Le me´canisme qui me`ne a` l’e´jection de l’e´lectron a` l’exte´rieur de la photocathode est en fait complexe :
l’e´lectron(s) e´mis a` la suite de l’absorption par effet photoe´lectrique du photon incident subit une se´rie
d’interactions avec les autres e´lectrons pre´sents dans le mate´riau et perd rapidement cette e´nergie.
Au cours de ce trajet, il ionise lui-meˆme d’autres atomes et cre´e ainsi une se´rie d’e´lectrons chauds
secondaires au sein du mate´riau. Eventuellement, un ou plusieurs de ces e´lectrons peuvent atteindre
la surface et quitter la photocathode.
Cependant, pour quitter le mate´riau, l’e´lectron doit passer une barrie`re de potentiel appele´e affinite´
e´lectronique dans le cas des semi-conducteurs, ou travail de sortie dans le cas des me´taux. Du fait
de leur thermalisation rapide apre`s e´jection de l’atome, peu d’e´lectrons peuvent effectivement passer
cette barrie`re et les rendements d’e´mission sont en ge´ne´ral faibles.
133
Les photocathodes pre´sentant les meilleurs rendements pre´sentent la particularite´ de pre´senter une
affinite´ e´lectronique ne´gative. Ainsi, les e´lectrons chauds pre´sents dans le mate´riau sont facilement
e´jecte´s et les rendements sont e´leve´s. Cependant, ces mate´riaux pre´sentent aussi une grande sensibilite´
a` toute forme de pollution de leur surface, qui leur fait perdre cette affinite´ e´lectronique ne´gative.
En conclusion, ide´alement une photocathode pour de´tecteurs a` gaz pre´sente les caracte´ristiques sui-
vantes :
Une affinite´ e´lectronique ne´gative : afin de laisser sortir un maximum d’e´lectrons chauds cre´e´s
a` la suite de l’absorption du photon incident.
Un grand pouvoir d’arreˆt : afin de garantir que les photons seront absorbe´s pre`s de la surface
d’e´jection des e´lectrons. Le pouvoir d’arreˆt est en ge´ne´ral plus e´leve´ avec des e´le´ments de nume´ro
atomique Z e´leve´.
Une faible re´activite´ chimique : afin d’e´viter une trop grande sensibilite´ de la photocathode a` la
pollution par le gaz utilise´ pour l’amplification du signal (en particulier, les ions ge´ne´re´s lors de
l’avalanche e´lectronique sont une grande source de pollution).
Modalite´s de l’e´tude de photocathodes a` efficacite´ quantique supe´rieure
L’e´tude entreprise lors du travail de the`se comporte Trois e´tapes principales :
1. Une e´tude the´orique des photocathodes. En particulier un code de simulation par Monte Carlo
a e´te´ de´veloppe´ pour simuler l’efficacite´ des photocathodes.
2. L’e´tude et la fabrication d’un dispositif expe´rimental permettant de tester concre`tement des
photocathodes.

introduction a` la me´thode Monte Carlo
A la suite de sa premie`re utilisation au cours du Projet Manhattan a` Los Alamos au lendemain de la
seconde guerre mondiale pour le de´veloppement de la bombe nucle´aire ame´ricaine, la me´thode Monte
Carlo pour la simulation du transport de particules dans la matie`re est devenue un outil standard de
la physique des particules.
Cette me´thode permet de rendre compte de l’aspect ale´atoire de l’interaction des particules avec la
matie`re. Elle consiste a` simuler le trajet des particules en calculant la probabilite´ d’interaction d’une
particule au moyen d’un ge´ne´rateur de nombres ale´atoires, et des densite´s de probabilite´s d’interac-
tions pour chacun des me´canismes d’interaction connus. Ces densite´s de probabilite´s sont e´value´es au
moyen des tables de sections efficaces, qui sont des grandeurs expe´rimentales.
134 Re´sume´
le code de´veloppe´
Le de´veloppement d’un code de simulation par Monte Carlo est un projet tre`s ambitieux en soi, aussi
une librairie standard de simulation par Monte Carlo a-t-elle e´te´ utilise´e pour e´crire le code.
Le choix a e´te´ porte´ surGeant4, une librairie de´veloppe´e par un consortium de laboratoires et pilote´e
par le CERN. L’ensemble du code ainsi qu’une documentation de´taille´e est disponible sur le site du
CERN, ce qui a fortement participe´ a` la popularite´ du code, outre ses performances de simulations
reconnues.
En particulier, c’est la pre´sence de plusieurs bibliothe`ques de´die´es aux basses e´nergies qui a justifie´
l’adoption de Geant4 comme base du code.
Les simulations devaient permettre de pre´dire le gain en efficacite´ de certaines microstructures, et de
pre´dire les efficacite´s quantiques de certains mate´riaux encore non e´tudie´s.
Malheureusement, il s’est ave´re´ que le code e´tait beaucoup trop impre´cis pour mener a` bien ce type
de calcul. Les efficacite´s pre´vues par le code se sont ave´re´es comple`tement fausses dans un certain
nombre de cas de´ja` connus.
Une e´tude plus approfondie a montre´ que la simulation de photocathodes est actuellement impossible
avec ce type de simulations. Deux facteurs principaux expliquent cela :
Les tables de sections efficaces utilise´es par les codes Monte Carlo sont trop impre´cises. En effet,
l’obtention de valeurs de sections efficaces a` basse e´nergie est beaucoup plus difficile qu’a` haute
e´nergie, du fait du nombre d’interactions que subissent les particules a` ces e´nergies. De ce fait,
les tables de sections efficaces a` basse e´nergie sont base´es sur des mode`les semi-empiriques, et
sont entache´es de nombreuses incertitudes.
L’approche interaction particule/atome qui est utilise´e est globalement trop grossie`re : elle ne
permet pas de rendre compte efficacement de l’e´tat chimique du mate´riau et de sa surface. En
particulier, l’e´tat de surface, qui s’ave`re eˆtre une donne´e cruciale n’est pas mode´lisable par une
approche purement atomistique.
Le code n’a donc pas pu eˆtre utilise´ pour effectuer des simulations de photocathodes.
Etude et construction d’un dispositif expe´rimental
Afin de pouvoir tester expe´rimentalement les photocathodes envisage´es, un dispositif adapte´ a e´te´
cre´e´.
Il consiste essentiellement en une chambre a` vide munie de connecteurs et d’une feneˆtre adapte´e, et
d’un ampe`reme`tre tre`s pre´cis : la chambre posse`de une fine feneˆtre de beryllium permettant de laisser
passer une large proportion du flux de rayons X. Des connecteurs triaxs permettent de connecter
directement sur la chambre le pre´-amplificateur associe´ a` l’ampe`reme`tre. Au sein de la chambre,
l’ensemble des pie`ces supportant la photocathode au plus pre`s de la feneˆtre est re´alise´ en PEEK,
mate´riau pre´sentant a` la fois une grande durete´ et une re´sistance e´lectrique e´leve´e. Une grille de
collection est monte´e environ 5mm au-dessus de la photocathode teste´e. Enfin, un connecteur CF
standard permet la connection a` une pompe.
135
L’ampe`reme`tre utilise´ est un Keithley 6430. Cet appareil est capable de mesurer des courants infe´rieurs
au fA, graˆce a` la pre´sence d’un pre´-ampli exte´rieur, qui permet d’approcher autant que possible les
connecteurs de la source de courant.
Le dispositif de mesure a e´te´ teste´ avec succe`s avec une source radioactive a` des courants de l’ordre
de 0,5fA. Le courant de fuite e´tant infe´rieur a` 10% de la valeur mesure´e.
Cependant, le dispositif a e´te´ essentiellement utilise´ avec un tube conventionnel de rayons X, cathode
de cuivre. L’ensemble des ope´rations de montages du dispositif et des e´chantillons s’est de´roule´ en
salle blanche.
Les photocathodes e´tudie´es et leur efficacite´
Principalement deux approches ont e´te´ adopte´es pour ame´liorer l’efficacite´ des photocathodes exis-
tantes :
– L’e´tude de certaines microstructures et de leurs effets
– L’e´tude de nouveaux mate´riaux
Des microstructures pour ame´liorer les mate´riaux de´ja` connus
L’effet de microstructures sur l’efficacite´ des e´missions a e´te´ e´tudie´.
Deux types d’effets ont e´te´ recherche´s :
– Un effet purement ge´ome´trique afin de profiter de l’augmentation du rendement d’e´mission dans le
cas d’incidence oblique.
– Un effet d’e´mission de champ a e´te´ recherche´ par l’e´tude de micro-pointes de silicium.
Emission de champ
Dans le cas de structures tre`s pointues, telles que des pointes de silicium, il se produit une concentra-
tion du champ e´lectrique aux alentours de la pointe. L’ide´e e´tait donc de profiter de cette concentration
du champ e´lectrique normalement utilise´ pour faire migrer les e´lectrons photo e´mis vers la grille de
collection, pour e´tudier un e´ventuel phe´nome`ne d’augmentation du rendement d’e´mission par effet de
champ.
Malheureusement, aucun courant n’a pu eˆtre de´tecte´ par ce biais. C’est probablement le faible pouvoir
stoppant du silicium qui peut expliquer la tre`s faible efficacite´ quantique du silicium dans ce cas. En
effet, si les e´lectrons sont cre´e´s trop loin de la surface de la photocathode, une tre`s faible proportion
d’entre eux parvient a` la surface, ce qui se traduit par un rendement global tre`s faible.
Effet de l’angle
Dans le cas d’une incidence oblique des rayons X sur la surface du mate´riau, il se produit une
augmentation du rendement de la photocathode. En effet, une plus large proportion (facteur 1cosα
si α est l’angle d’incidence vis-a`-vis de la normale a` la surface) des photons est absorbe´e au sein de
la zone active de la photocathode (imme´diatement a` proximite´ de la surface). Il s’en suit donc une
augmentation du nombre d’e´lectrons qui peuvent s’e´chapper.
136 Re´sume´
L’effet de structures, facile a` obtenir sur de larges surfaces (il s’agissait en fait de papier de verre clas-
sique ou de type Trizact), a re´ve´le´ que l’on obtient facilement un doublement de l’efficacite´ quantique
avec de simples structures pyramidales re´gulie`rement place´es a` la surface de la photocathode.
Le CsI3 comme nouveau mate´riau de photocathode
Le mate´riau le plus efficace actuellement connu est le CsI. En effet, ce sel de deux compose´s de
nume´ro atomique Z e´leve´ pre´sente un pouvoir stoppeur important, double´ d’une affinite´ e´lectronique
ne´gative.
De ce fait, le CsI peut revendiquer des efficacite´s de plusieurs pour-cents a` des e´nergies de quelques
keV.
Malheureusement, comme tous les mate´riaux a` affinite´ ne´gative, il est aussi fortement sensible a` la
pollution due a` son environnement, et, a` moins de le laisser sous ultra-vide (ce qui est re´alisable au
sein des photomultiplicateurs scelle´s) son utilisation ne peut eˆtre envisage´e au sein d’un de´tecteur a`
gaz (et ce malgre´ de tre`s nombreuses e´tudes dans ce sens).
En substitution a` ce mate´riau, le CsI3 : un de ses de´rive´s, peut constituer une alternative inte´ressante.
Le CsI3 est un mate´riau de couleur marron-orange´, instable sous vide (il se de´compose selon la
re´action CsI → CsI + I ), pre´sentant une densite´ de 4, 51gc˙m−33 2 . C’est un cristal dont la structure
appartient au groupe Pmcn.
Le mate´riau est commercialise´ par des entreprises telles que Sigma-Aldrich ou peut eˆtre obtenu en
mettant un e´chantillon de CsI au sein d’un atmosphe`re sature´e d’iode.
Les tests du CsI3 ont montre´ une efficacite´ intrinse`que inte´ressante, qui de plus augmente apre`s
quelques heures place´ sous vide (pression de l’ordre de 10−4 mBar).
Une e´tude plus pousse´e de ce mate´riau a permis d’e´tablir un sce´nario permettant d’expliquer cette
ame´lioration.
Lorsque la photocathode est laisse´e sous vide, le CsI3 se de´compose en CsI. Ceci explique l’ame´lioration
de l’efficacite´ alors constate´e, en effet le CsI est actuellement le meilleur mate´riau connu pour la
constitution de photocathodes. Il pre´sente cependant le de´faut d’eˆtre particulie`rement sensible a` la
pollution par le milieu, et en particulier, il est tre`s hygroscopique.
A l’inverse le CsI3 semble eˆtre particulie`rement peu sensible a` la pollution. Il peut de plus eˆtre
re´ge´ne´re´ apre`s un passage sous vide (et donc la transformation de sa surface en CsI) par mise dans
une enceinte contenant de l’iode solide, et donc ou` la pression partielle de I2 est importante.
L’e´tude a aussi montre´ une modification de la structure de la surface qui prend un caracte`re poreux
lors de la transformation CsI3 → CsI + I2. Ainsi, lorsque le processus de mise en contact avec I2
puis mise sous enceinte sous vide est re´pe´te´, l’efficacite´ s’en trouve ame´liore´e.
L’utilisation de CsI3 comme pre´curseur du CsI est donc inte´ressante en soi, car elle permet une
structuration du CsI. On perd cependant la plus grande insensibilite´ du CsI3 en regard a` celle du
CsI. Ainsi, meˆme si le CsI pur est plus efficace que le CsI3 (facteur 8 environ), une fois pollue´, le
CsI est beaucoup moins efficace que le CsI3.
Cette approche peut s’ave´rer tre`s utile pour permettre l’utilisation du CsI comme photocathode dans
137
le cas des de´tecteurs a` gaz. En effet il est possible de fabriquer les de´tecteurs munis de la photocathode
sous forme de CsI3 ce qui permet sa manipulation sous air. Ensuite, le de´tecteur e´tant herme´tique,
la transformation du CsI3 en CsI permet l’obtention d’une photocathode pre´sentant un caracte`re
poreux, et donc d’une grande efficacite´. Ceci apporte aussi une solution au proble`me de la maintenance
qui ne´cessite souvent l’ouverture du de´tecteur. On peut en effet prote´ger la photocathode de CsI en
l’exposant pre´alablement a` de l’iode (I2) ce qui la rend re´sistante a` l’humidite´. Ainsi il n’est plus
ne´cessaire d’ouvrir le de´tecteur en enceinte prote´ge´e de l’humidite´.
